The platform, a 400-foot (122-meter) repurposed barge, will be outfitted with autonomous ground support systems to capture and secure the returning Neutron rocket. Other enhancements will include blast shielding to safeguard onboard equipment during landings and station-keeping thrusters for precise positioning at sea. Rocket Lab has acquired the barge, with modifications expected to continue through 2025, leading to operational deployment in 2026. Neutron, Rocket Lab's reusable carbon composite medium-lift launch vehicle, is designed to support a range of missions, including single and multi-satellite deployments, national security operations, and interplanetary cargo transport. With a payload capacity of up to 33,000 pounds (15,000 kg), Neutron is being developed at a rapid pace, leveraging Rocket Lab's expertise as a high-frequency launch provider. The rocket can execute two reusable landing profiles based on mission parameters. For certain missions, Neutron will return to Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 in Virginia for a propulsive landing. Alternatively, for missions requiring maximum payload performance, the rocket will execute a Down Range Landing (DRL) maneuver, touching down on the 'Return On Investment' ocean platform. Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, emphasized the urgency behind Neutron's development, stating, We're working hard to bring Neutron online with one of the fastest development schedules in history for a new rocket, because we know medium-lift launch opportunities are limited and space access is being stifled. Neutron's debut launch planned for later this year will help to ease that bottleneck, and our new landing platform will open space access even further by enabling even more mission opportunities that require maximum Neutron performance. Rocket Lab plans for Neutron's inaugural launch from Virginia in the latter half of 2025.

The agreement builds upon a previous multi-launch contract signed in 2024, bringing iQPS' total reserved Electron missions to eight. Under these agreements, six launches are scheduled for 2025 and two in 2026. This follows the successful deployment of iQPS's QPS-SAR-5 satellite, "TSUKUYOMI-I," via an Electron rocket in December 2023. The deal represents one of the largest Electron launch contracts to date, second only to Rocket Lab's ten-launch agreement with Japanese satellite operator Synspective. Each of these launches will contribute to the development of iQPS' planned constellation of 36 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites. These satellites are designed to provide high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities regardless of time of day or weather conditions, delivering near real-time observation data globally. With exclusive use of each Electron mission, iQPS gains precise control over launch schedules, orbital parameters, and mission specifications, optimizing deployment for its growing satellite network. Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the importance of tailored launch solutions for constellation operators. Electron's strength lies in its ability to provide precise constellation deployment on a customized timeline. Accurate orbital positioning is crucial for Earth imaging missions, and the demand for this capability is reflected in our growing number of multi-launch contracts with returning customers like iQPS. We are honored to once again support iQPS in achieving its mission. Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership: We are thrilled to expand our collaboration with Rocket Lab, securing additional dedicated Electron launches. Electron's high-frequency launch capability and reliability make it an excellent choice for our growing satellite constellation. This agreement is a significant milestone in our commitment to realizing our vision over the next two years. The next Electron mission for iQPS is set for launch as early as March 2025, with additional details to be released closer to the launch date.

Selected in April 2024 for the $32 million contract, Rocket Lab is collaborating with Space Safari and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to develop and operate a spacecraft with rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) capabilities. The mission will be executed using Rocket Lab's vertically integrated Pioneer spacecraft, which will be launched aboard an Electron rocket from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. VICTUS HAZE is designed to showcase responsive space capabilities, demonstrating the ability to achieve launch readiness within 24 hours, track and approach target objects, and assess on-orbit threats. Rocket Lab's comprehensive approach integrates spacecraft manufacturing, launch execution, and mission operations to provide rapid-response solutions for national security. The completion of CDR confirms that the spacecraft's design, assembly, integration, testing, and operational strategies align with the mission's stringent requirements and constraints. "The ability to build a spacecraft, launch it, and operate it all in-house, on a tactically responsive timeline, is incredibly rare, but with our extensive launch heritage and deep vertical integration across space systems, we're ideally suited to make this mission a success," said Brad Clevenger, President and CEO of Rocket Lab National Security. "VICTUS HAZE solidifies Rocket Lab as a trusted and highly capable, end-to-end space company that can enable complex missions to serve the needs of the nation." With the successful CDR, the program now moves into the production phase, which will focus on spacecraft and launch vehicle integration, as well as preparing ground systems in anticipation of launch later this year.
