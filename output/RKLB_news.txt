This mission, titled "The Lightning God Reigns," is set to lift off from Rocket Lab's private launch facility, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, in New Zealand. The launch window opens on March 10 UTC. The payload for this mission is a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, QPS-SAR-9, also known as "SUSANOO-I." The satellite will be deployed into a 575km circular Earth orbit, contributing to iQPS' expanding constellation, which aims to provide high-resolution Earth imagery with updates from targeted locations approximately every 10 minutes. "The Lightning God Reigns" is the first of eight planned launches that Rocket Lab will conduct for iQPS through 2025 and 2026, following a previous successful launch in December 2023. Each mission will utilize a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband to facilitate the separation and deployment of the satellite once in orbit. This launch will mark Rocket Lab's third mission of 2025, bringing the company's total Electron flights to 61 and increasing the number of satellites deployed by Rocket Lab to 211.

The Blue Ghost 1 lander's performance was bolstered by Rocket Lab's advanced software, which provides critical functions such as commanding, telemetry processing, autonomous sequencing, attitude determination, guidance, navigation, control, and fault protection. These capabilities ensured mission success across all operational phases, from launch to lunar touchdown. Rocket Lab's Mission Operations Center in Littleton, Colorado, operated as a remote and backup control hub for Firefly's primary operations base in Texas. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab's spacecraft operations team collaborated closely with Firefly's Blue Ghost operations team in both Colorado and Texas. Their responsibilities included orbit determination, maneuver planning, command generation, and continuous monitoring of the lander's guidance, navigation, and control systems to ensure a smooth journey and landing. In addition to software support, Rocket Lab contributed three high-efficiency solar power assemblies, mounted on the lander's sides and top deck. These systems provided a total of 400 W of power, sustaining operations for the mission's 1,470-hour duration. "Congratulations to the Firefly team for the successful landing of the Blue Ghost 1 mission, a remarkable accomplishment achieved by few," said Kyle Andringa, Rocket Lab's Senior Director Space Systems Software. "Rocket Lab is honored to support this mission with our flight-proven space software and state-of-the-art components." Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, aimed at advancing lunar exploration and scientific research by delivering cutting-edge instruments and technology demonstrations to the Moon.

The W-2 mission carried a hypersonic re-entry capsule featuring a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), a heatshield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed with NASA's Ames Research Center, and an expanded bioreactor to enhance pharmaceutical manufacturing in orbit. This mission follows the W-1 mission, which, after an eight-month operation in orbit, marked the world's first space manufacturing venture conducted outside the International Space Station. Following the January 14 launch of W-2, Rocket Lab maintained control of the spacecraft for six weeks, overseeing essential mission functions for Varda's 120kg capsule, including power management, communications, propulsion, and attitude control. The Pioneer spacecraft, designed and built at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, integrates in-house developed technologies, including propulsion systems, star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, and separation systems. To guide the capsule's return to Earth, Rocket Lab executed a series of precision deorbit and re-entry maneuvers. The process began with a burn to reduce the orbit's perigee to 300km from an initial 500km circular orbit. A second burn raised the apogee to 900km, positioning the spacecraft for re-entry. The final burn released the capsule from approximately 470km altitude. The final phase of the mission, including parachute deployment, touchdown, and payload recovery, was managed by Varda, which will now analyze the results for future missions. "Rocket Lab's expertise has expanded from delivering payloads to space to successfully bringing them back to Earth," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Supporting Varda's ambitious in-orbit manufacturing mission with another successful re-entry highlights our ability to enable complex space missions that fully leverage the potential of space." Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda, added, "Varda continues to lead in repeatable, reliable re-entry from orbit, and the success of the W-2 mission further cements our position. With additional re-entries planned, we look forward to advancing a robust orbital economy." The W-2 mission is the second of four Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing. The third spacecraft has been completed and shipped to Vandenberg Space Force Base for an upcoming launch.

Stocks were higher on Friday as President Trump’s latest announcement of new tariffs and China’s vow to retaliate heightened trade tensions. At around 12:40 PM in New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average popped by 0.2%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge tracking consumer spending on goods and services, was released in the morning, showing a 2.6% annual inflation rate for January—matching estimates and signaling steady inflation. Here are stocks to watch today: Dell (DELL+3.48%) shares declined on Friday after the tech company posted better-than-expected earnings but reported revenue of $23.9 billion, falling short of the projected $24.55 billion. Investors are also concerned about the profitability of the firm’s server business. Monster Beverage (MNST+0.51%) stock gained on Friday after the drink company’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ expectations, even as earnings per share fell short, Reuters reported. NetApp’s (NTAP+1.72%) shares fell in the afternoon as the company’s revenue missed consensus. AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA+0.85%) recovered in the morning following President Trump’s tariff plans and China’s vows to take retaliatory measures. Earlier this week, the chip giant surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, highlighting sustained demand fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Rocket Lab (RKLB+7.61%) stock plunged on Friday after the commercial space company posted fourth-quarter results that were in line with expectations but issued disappointing guidance and announced product delays.

The platform, a 400-foot (122-meter) repurposed barge, will be outfitted with autonomous ground support systems to capture and secure the returning Neutron rocket. Other enhancements will include blast shielding to safeguard onboard equipment during landings and station-keeping thrusters for precise positioning at sea. Rocket Lab has acquired the barge, with modifications expected to continue through 2025, leading to operational deployment in 2026. Neutron, Rocket Lab's reusable carbon composite medium-lift launch vehicle, is designed to support a range of missions, including single and multi-satellite deployments, national security operations, and interplanetary cargo transport. With a payload capacity of up to 33,000 pounds (15,000 kg), Neutron is being developed at a rapid pace, leveraging Rocket Lab's expertise as a high-frequency launch provider. The rocket can execute two reusable landing profiles based on mission parameters. For certain missions, Neutron will return to Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 in Virginia for a propulsive landing. Alternatively, for missions requiring maximum payload performance, the rocket will execute a Down Range Landing (DRL) maneuver, touching down on the 'Return On Investment' ocean platform. Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, emphasized the urgency behind Neutron's development, stating, We're working hard to bring Neutron online with one of the fastest development schedules in history for a new rocket, because we know medium-lift launch opportunities are limited and space access is being stifled. Neutron's debut launch planned for later this year will help to ease that bottleneck, and our new landing platform will open space access even further by enabling even more mission opportunities that require maximum Neutron performance. Rocket Lab plans for Neutron's inaugural launch from Virginia in the latter half of 2025.

Title: Rocket Lab Expands Multi-Launch Partnership with iQPS Securing Eight Electron Missions
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Expands_Multi_Launch_Partnership_with_iQPS_Securing_Eight_Electron_Missions_999.html
Time Published: 2025-02-28T13:29:03Z
Full Content:
The agreement builds upon a previous multi-launch contract signed in 2024, bringing iQPS' total reserved Electron missions to eight. Under these agreements, six launches are scheduled for 2025 and two in 2026. This follows the successful deployment of iQPS's QPS-SAR-5 satellite, "TSUKUYOMI-I," via an Electron rocket in December 2023. The deal represents one of the largest Electron launch contracts to date, second only to Rocket Lab's ten-launch agreement with Japanese satellite operator Synspective. Each of these launches will contribute to the development of iQPS' planned constellation of 36 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites. These satellites are designed to provide high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities regardless of time of day or weather conditions, delivering near real-time observation data globally. With exclusive use of each Electron mission, iQPS gains precise control over launch schedules, orbital parameters, and mission specifications, optimizing deployment for its growing satellite network. Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the importance of tailored launch solutions for constellation operators. Electron's strength lies in its ability to provide precise constellation deployment on a customized timeline. Accurate orbital positioning is crucial for Earth imaging missions, and the demand for this capability is reflected in our growing number of multi-launch contracts with returning customers like iQPS. We are honored to once again support iQPS in achieving its mission. Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership: We are thrilled to expand our collaboration with Rocket Lab, securing additional dedicated Electron launches. Electron's high-frequency launch capability and reliability make it an excellent choice for our growing satellite constellation. This agreement is a significant milestone in our commitment to realizing our vision over the next two years. The next Electron mission for iQPS is set for launch as early as March 2025, with additional details to be released closer to the launch date.
