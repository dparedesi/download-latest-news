The launch will support the AFRL's Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics (REGAL) program, an initiative designed to demonstrate rocket-based point-to-point transportation for rapid global cargo delivery. As part of this contract, Rocket Lab's Neutron will conduct a re-entry test, validating its ability to return payloads safely to Earth - a key milestone for future REGAL missions. Neutron, Rocket Lab's next-generation reusable launch vehicle, is engineered to deliver up to 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit, providing government and commercial customers a cost-effective, reliable, and flexible launch option. The vehicle's advanced carbon composite construction and integrated recovery design enable it to return its first stage and payload fairings as a single unit, significantly reducing turnaround times and enhancing operational efficiency. According to Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, "Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability for government and commercial space users in medium launch. This opportunity for the U.S. Air Force not only helps to advance space logistics, it also demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the DOD in Neutron's capabilities. Anticipation is high for Neutron's inaugural flight this year, and we're excited to showcase Neutron as a platform for R and D for point-to-point logistics for the DoD." Rocket Lab has been making significant progress at its launch site at Wallops Island, Virginia, with site completion expected within the coming weeks. The company continues to advance production and testing efforts for the Neutron rocket, including full-scale component trials and Archimedes engine testing, all of which remain on track for the vehicle's first flight in the second half of 2025. Rocket Lab's Neutron is a reusable medium-lift launch vehicle optimized for both government and commercial missions, including satellite mega-constellations and national security payloads. Neutron's unique design, featuring a carbon composite structure and an innovative upper stage, enables efficient payload deployment and high reusability. Powered by nine Archimedes engines on its first stage and a vacuum-optimized Archimedes engine on the second stage, Neutron operates from Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 3 (LC-3) at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia.
