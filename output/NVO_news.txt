March 29, 2025 14:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial, demonstrating that Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)1. These new data from the phase 3b trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US and simultaneously published today in New England Journal of Medicine2. The SOUL trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with type 2 diabetes and CVD and/or CKD when treated with Rybelsus® compared to placebo. Each component of MACE, being CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, contributed to the risk reduction1. “Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of disability and death for people with type 2 diabetes, and there is a need for new, patient-centric treatments to help manage this risk,” said Darren McGuire, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Science and Teaching Professor of Medicine at UT Southwestern, US, and SOUL steering committee co-chair. “The SOUL trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or CKD demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and CV death in those treated with oral semaglutide vs placebo. The proven cardiovascular benefit reflects a profound clinical impact for our patients who now have an oral option to improve health outcomes.” Cardiometabolic diseases span a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease3. When combined, these conditions represent the leading cause of death globally4. Having type 2 diabetes directly increases the risk of developing interconnected cardiometabolic diseases, while also contributing to the progression of other cardiovascular risk factors5. Nearly one in three adults with type 2 diabetes have CVD6. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside our other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide in SOUL was consistent with that seen in previous semaglutide trials, and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in participants receiving Rybelsus® than those receiving placebo, mostly due to the higher rate of cardiovascular events and infections in the placebo group. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders (17.8% and 19.8%, respectively) and infections/infestations (15.0% and 16.5%, respectively) in the Rybelsus® and placebo arms1. In a key secondary analysis from SOUL published simultaneously, oral semaglutide reduced risk of MACE independently of baseline use of SGLT2i and suggests similar benefits in participants with and without concomitant SGLT2i use during trial7. SOUL confirmed the well-established safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient years8. Based on data from the SOUL clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Rybelsus®, which has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA. A decision is anticipated in 2025. About SOUL SOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD9,10. About Rybelsus®Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise11,12. Rybelsus® is administered once daily and is approved for use in three therapeutic dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg13,14.

March 29, 2025 10:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from STRIDE, a phase 3b peripheral artery disease (PAD) outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly injectable Ozempic® (semaglutide 1.0 mg) in adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US1. These new data from the phase 3 trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the ACC and simultaneously published today in The Lancet2. The double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled STRIDE trial achieved its primary endpoint, with semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrating a superior and clinically meaningful improvement of 13% in maximum walking distance and a mean treatment difference of 39.9 meters on a steep incline, compared to placebo at week 52. The trial also demonstrated superiority to placebo for all confirmatory secondary outcomes assessed, including pain-free walking distance at week 52, health-related quality of life (Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6) at week 52, and maximum walking distance at week 571. “Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may cause severe symptoms, physical limitations, and a diminished quality of life, often making even short walks, such as retrieving the mail challenging. In individuals with PAD and diabetes, the disease can be even more severe, affecting small blood vessels and limiting the effectiveness of revascularization procedures and other treatments. Semaglutide 1.0 mg is the first medication in over two decades to show improvements in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as well as meaningful improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, which could address a critical unmet need for those with both PAD and type 2 diabetes," said Marc P. Bonaca, MD, Director of Vascular Research, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Lead Investigator of the STRIDE trial. “The significant improvements in walking distance and patient-reported quality of life observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg in the STRIDE trial are promising and represent an important step forward on the path to advancing treatment options for this patient population.” PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is under-screened and underdiagnosed and impacts approximately 230 million people globally3. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD, and nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. There are limited therapies available to specifically improve functional limitations in PAD, representing a significant unmet need in this population5. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The safety results from the STRIDE trial are consistent with the well-established safety and tolerability profile of once-weekly semaglutide1, supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient-years of exposure6. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (74 [19%] vs 78 [20%]). SAE probably related to treatment occurred in 2 participants (1%) in the semaglutide group and in 2 participants (1%) in the placebo group. SAE possibly related to treatment occurred in 3 (1%) and 4 (1%) participants, respectively. SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation of semaglutide or placebo were less common in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (11 [3%] vs 13 [3%]). SAEs led to the death of 3 (1%) and 8 (2%) participants in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively; however, no SAEs leading to death were treatment-related1. Based on data from the STRIDE clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Ozempic® to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision is anticipated in 2025. About STRIDE STRIDE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3b clinical trial assessing the benefit of once-weekly injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg, marketed as Ozempic®, on functional capacity. It enrolled 792 participants with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic PAD with walking-induced leg pain. The primary endpoint was maximum walking distance on a constant load treadmill for people treated with semaglutide compared to placebo at week 52. STRIDE is the only dedicated PAD functional outcomes trial with a GLP-1 RA. About PADLower extremity PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The classical symptom is intermittent claudication, associated with limited walking ability and poor health-related quality of life7. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD; nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. While anti-atherosclerotic therapies and lifestyle changes are recommended, there are no effective therapies to specifically improve functional outcomes in PAD and type 2 diabetes8. About Ozempic®Ozempic® (semaglutide) injection 0.25, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg is a once-weekly GLP-1 RA indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with known heart disease9,10. Ozempic® is currently marketed in 75 countries and 7 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Ozempic® worldwide11.

Title: Wegovy sales took a hit this year. Novo's CEO blames off-brand competition

Time Published: 2025-03-27T21:04:00Z
Full Content:
Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.81%) blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy took a hit due to rising competition from off-brand, or compounded, versions of the treatment, according to the Danish pharma giant’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. The growing popularity of compounded semaglutide — a copycat version of the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — was top of mind for both the company’s executives and shareholders at an annual meeting. Still, Jørgensen touted that the company’s weight-loss drug sales rose 57% last year. “We are currently treating around 1.2 million obese patients in the U.S., while 55 million people have insurance coverage for Wegovy,” said Jørgensen. “We continue to focus on scaling, supply, commercial execution, and combating compounding.” Compounding refers to the custom preparation of an otherwise branded drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Drugs can also be compounded under other conditions, including when a patented medication is in short supply. But with Novo Nordisk ramping up production and Wegovy no longer on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) shortage list, the pharma giant claims that most compounded versions are no longer justified. The FDA has also said it could start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer certain versions of compounded semaglutide starting as early as May 22. Novo Nordisk lists Wegovy at $1,349.02 per month, and drug-shortage rules allowed compounders to sell versions of the drug at lower prices. Jørgensen acknowledged that the “significant growth of compounding in the U.S.” appears to have affected Wegovy prescriptions in early 2025. For instance, the millennial-targeted telehealth company Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide last May. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. One shareholder asked how long it would take for the trend to reverse, citing rumors that compounded drugs could account for as much as 40% of the U.S. obesity treatment market. Jørgensen did not provide a specific timeline but outlined the company’s multi-pronged strategy to combat competition from compounders. Novo Nordisk says it’s deploying a mix of legal action, physician outreach, and pricing incentives. The company has sued multiple compounders, launched an ad campaign to warn doctors and patients about the risks of non-FDA-approved versions, and introduced a new cash-only option offering Wegovy for $499 per month.
