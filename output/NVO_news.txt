Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.35%) teased some new details about a potential Ozempic successor during a call with investors Tuesday. The Danish pharma giant fielded several questions from interested analysts about its next-gen GLP-1 medication CagriSema, regarding its efficacy, safety, and supply chain. Novo Nordisk is known for its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company is working on a sequel. Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose on average 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. However, Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange told analysts he has “confidence” that larger trials will show CagriSema will help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials to arrive at that number. The company said that results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected later this year and in the first half of 2025. Novo Nordisk said the safety and tolerability of this new drug is expected to be similar to current GLP-1 drugs on the market, based on previous trials. Novo Nordisk chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said the decision to externally outsource a component of the new drug was the “rational choice” based “on a consideration around capabilities and manufacturing footprints.” He added the company is learning from its experience producing current GLP-1 drugs. “We take historic learnings with us in terms of ensuring that we have a resilient setup into the future for external sourcing approaches,” Knudsen said. In the past few years, Novo Nordisk has failed to produce enough GLP-1 meds to meet demand, which has resulted in shortages. The company is now investing billions to increase its manufacturing capacity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy continue to soar, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The Danish pharma giant posted its third-quarter earnings report early Wednesday morning and boasted sales figures blowing past analysts’ projections. “We are pleased with the performance in the first nine months of 2024. The sales growth is driven by increasing demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments, and we are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement. Sales of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy skyrocketed 79% to 17.3 billion Danish Krone ($2.5 billion) in the third-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.37 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug beat analysts’ expectations of $2.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.82%) Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. Eli Lilly reported its third-quarter earnings last week, but its blockbuster weight-loss drug failed to meet expectations. Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to FactSet.

Title: A new weight loss drug could beat Ozempic's side effect problem

The Denmark-based drug maker Zealand Pharma said Tuesday that its experimental weight-loss drug could help patients lose pounds with fewer side effects than current anti-obesity medications on the market. The company said that only about a third of patients that took up to 4.8 milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand revealed the new finding at the industry conference ObesityWeek in San Antonio, Bloomberg reports. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nauseau, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand Pharma reported in June that there were no serious or severe adverse events during the study and only one out 48 participants dropped out of the trial due to side effects. “These results support our conviction that petrelintide is very well tolerated and can potentially play an important role as an alternative to incretin-based therapies for the management of overweight and obesity,” said Zealand chief medical officer David Kendall in a press release, at the time. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Zealand’s petrelintide works different from Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs as it doesn’t mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Instead, it mimics a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas that increases satiety, known as amylin. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost on average 8.6% of their weight. For comparison, a clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. The company plans start a mid-stage trial of the drug later this year and expects it could hit the market in 2029 or 2030, according to Bloomberg. In August, the company said it is looking for a potential partnership with a big pharma company to help it develop, manufacture, and sell petrelintide. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Now, several pharmaceutical companies are working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Zealand Pharma, Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, and Pfizer are all developing new weight-loss drugs.

Title: Hims & Hers will start selling a generic weight loss drug

The millennial-skewed telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-0.89%) announced Monday that it will start offering customers a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight loss drug, next year. The news comes as some patients still struggle to fill prescriptions of the most advanced branded GLP-1 treatments on the market like Zepbound, Wegovy and Ozempic. Hims CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday that company as already “confirmed a core supplier” for its new offering. Liraglutide is currently sold under the brand name Saxenda by Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.35%) and many of its patents have already expired. In a 56-week-long clinical trial, the once-daily injection helped most patients lose over 5% of their weight. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+4.38%) weekly-injectable Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. Newer versions of these treatments, like Wegovy and Ozempic, have become highly sought after because of their effectiveness at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy have been for most of the year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows pharmacies to make compounded, or altered, versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight loss drugs during recent shortages. A generic liraglutide offering will provide Hims customers more options as these shortages start to end. The company started selling compounded weight loss drugs this year. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to companies selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. The FDA also recently updated its drug shortage database to show that the all doses of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are now available. However, the drugs continue to be considered in shortage for now as the agency and Novo Nordisk work to ensure a steady supply. Hims chief financial officer Yemi Okupe told Yahoo Finance that company is hearing from customers that they are still finding it difficult to find branded GLP-1s on pharmacy shelves. “In our view, we do still see that the medications are on shortage,” Okupe said. “What consumers are telling us resoundingly is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
