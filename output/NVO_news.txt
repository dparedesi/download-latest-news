A federal judge in Texas handed Novo Nordisk (NVO) a big win late Thursday in its battle against cheaper versions of its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, rejecting a bid by compounding pharmacies to keep making the drugs while a legal challenge moves forward. In a sealed order U.S. Judge Mark Pittman denied a request for preliminary injunction a trade group representing compounding pharmacies that would have prevented the Food and Drug Administration from taking action against its members for making knock-off versions using semaglutide, the active ingredient in the weight loss drugs. Small-scale compounders must now immediately stop making their versions of Ozempic and Wegovy. Larger, federally licensed compounders have until May 22 to keep producing the copycats. The popular drugs had been in short supply for some two years, which led the FDA to declare a shortage, thus allowing pharmacists to legally make compounded versions of the patented medications. Many telehealth companies also jumped into the market with compounded drugs. However, in February the FDA determined that the semaglutide shortage was over, leading to the lawsuit by Outsourcing Facilities Association. “We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders’ attempts to undermine FDA’s data-based decision that the shortage of Wegovy® and Ozempic® is resolved,” said Steve Benz, Corporate Vice President, Legal and U.S. General Counsel, Novo Nordisk in an statement. He said that the company will continue driving legal actions forward “and escalate our efforts as necessary, while closely engaging with regulators and law enforcement.” Compounding pharmacies make drugs tailored to individual prescriptions for a specific patient and are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. Eli Lilly (LLY) has also taken aggressive legal action against compounding pharmacies, and on Wednesday filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies that offer cheaper versions of its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.

(Photo by Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock has experienced a significant decline, dropping 35% from over $90 in early March to around $58 currently. Several factors have contributed to this downward trend. The most recent impact stems from Eli Lilly meeting the primary goals in a late-stage trial for its daily diabetes pill. If approved, this pill's convenience could pose a competitive threat to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic injection, potentially leading to market share shifts. Additionally, concerns about Novo Nordisk's pipeline, which is perceived as less diversified than some competitors, alongside rising market competition, have also weighed on the stock. However, we believe that these concerns are now largely reflected in the current stock price. In fact, we consider NVO stock at around $58 to be extremely attractive, making it a compelling buying opportunity. Our view is that there is minimal fundamental cause for concern with Novo Nordisk; its current valuation appears exceptionally low, contributing significantly to its attractiveness. This conclusion is based on a thorough analysis comparing NVO’s current valuation with its operating performance over recent years, as well as its present and historical financial condition. Our assessment of Novo Nordisk across key parameters including Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains very strong operating performance and financial health, as will be detailed further. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NVO stock’s valuation looks moderate compared to the broader market. Novo Nordisk’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Novo Nordisk’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Novo Nordisk's balance sheet looks strong. NVO stock has been much more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Novo Nordisk's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Based on Novo Nordisk’s exceptionally strong performance across key metrics and its current moderate valuation, we believe the stock is highly attractive at its current price of $58. While past performance is strong, future prospects are also compelling. Novo Nordisk’s sales are forecast to achieve high-teen average growth over the next three years. Coupled with its robust profit margin exceeding 40%, a significant portion of this top-line growth is expected to translate directly into shareholder value. Although challenges such as increasing competition and the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on drug pricing exist, we believe these risks are adequately reflected in the stock’s current moderate valuation. Therefore, we believe that NVO represents a very good buying opportunity at this level. While NVO stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
