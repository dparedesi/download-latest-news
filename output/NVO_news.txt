Title: Ozempic and other weight-loss meds may be linked to conditions that could lead to blindness, study says

Popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic (NVO-2.63%) and Zepbound (LLY+0.86%), may have a potential link with several eye conditions that can cause vision loss, according to a new investigatory review published recently in the scientific journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The study focused on nine patients that received prescriptions for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy , or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound. Seven of the patients developed a rare eye condition known as NAION, a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Another patient developed bilateral papillitis — the swelling of both optic nerve heads. And the ninth patient developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy — the loss of blood flow to a part of the retina. The study authors hypothesized that the conditions were a result of rapid changes in blood sugar levels caused by the drugs, “rather than a toxic effect of the drugs.” “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz. “This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes.” The spokesperson added that Novo Nordisk has conducted an analysis across clinical trials of GLP-1 meds, the class of drugs that semaglutide belongs to, looking at NAION diagnoses and has found no evidence of a causal link between the drugs and the eye condition. Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction for the company’s branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Quartz. The study’s lead author, Bradley Katz — an opthlamologist and professor at the University of Utah, told MedicalNewsToday that the researchers are not recommending anyone to stop using the popular medications. “What we are recommending is that if you experience a change in your vision while using one of these drugs, you should consult the prescribing doctor and see an ophthalmologist,” Katz said. This review follows two studies from last year that also found a link between semaglutide and NAION. According to the study from December, diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications. Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 10, 2025 14:13 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT?

If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk and certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq retreat over inflation, tariff concerns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks turned lower on Friday as investors digested a jump in consumer expectations for inflation and a cooler-than-expected jobs report. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved 0.5% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also fell 0.5%, on the heels of a mixed day for stocks on Wall Street. The major gauges slid into the red after US consumer sentiment sank to a seven-month low in early February, undershooting forecasts. Inflation expectations jumped amid concerns about President Donald Trump's tariff threats. Americans now expect a rate of 4.3% over the next year, a full percentage point higher than last month, the University of Michigan survey found. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield rose to 4.5% in the wake of the sentiment update and the monthly jobs report. The US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, missing economist expectations, but still showing signs of resilience in the labor market. Unemployment ticked down to 4.0%, from 4.1% in December. The jobs report has become more crucial to hopes for another Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Investors are watching for cracks in the market's stability, as they eye President Donald Trump's tariff push and the chances of higher inflation. Meanwhile, eyes were on Amazon's (AMZN) earnings after it joined Google (GOOG) and other AI-focused Big Tech companies in disappointing Wall Street with its revenue outlook. Shares in Amazon dropped more than 3% in early trading. The three major gauges are still just about on track to close the earnings-packed week with small gains, even after unpredictable tariff news from Trump kept traders on their toes.. Today’s higher mortgage rate reality is finally sinking in with potential homebuyers and sellers. For months, a plurality of consumers polled by Fannie Mae were confident that mortgage rates would drop in the next year. But the mortgage giant's latest poll showed a 13-point swing away from that view. Just 35% of respondents surveyed by the mortgage giant in January now expect mortgage rates to drop, down from 42% in December and a survey-high 45% in November. Meanwhile, the share of consumers who think rates will rise jumped to 32%, from 25%. Housing market economists have warned that mortgage rates might not fall much this year after the Fed lowered its expectations for rate-cutting, and uncertainties linger over how President Donald Trump’s economic agenda could affect inflation and economic growth. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.89% this week through Wednesday. It's been hovering around 7% for all of 2025. The major averages turned negative after consumer sentiment data fell below expectations for the month of February. The Michigan consumer sentiment index dropped to 67.8, coming in below expectations of 71.8. The February preliminary reading was the lowest registered in about 7 months. "Year-ahead inflation expectations jumped up from 3.3% last month to 4.3% this month, the highest reading since November 2023 and marking two consecutive months of unusually large increases," said the survey. By 10:15 a.m. ET, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also fell 0.2%. Meanwhile the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.5%. Among the Big Tech names, Amazon's (AMZN) stock sank to session lows, dipping nearly 4% after the e-commerce giant issued disappointing revenue outlook. Stocks inched higher on Friday as investors digested a monthly jobs report that showed some resilience in the labor market. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovered near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) opened slightly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, less than the 173,000 expected by economists. However, hourly wages ticked higher, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.0% from 4.1%. Meanwhile, December's jobs additions were revised up to 307,000, from an earlier reading of 256,000 — a sign the labor market exited 2024 on a better footing than thought On the earnings front, Amazon's (AMZN) disappointing revenue outlook dragged on shares of the tech giant, which fell more than 2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: The US labor market showed continued signs of resilience in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and wages grew more than expected. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 4% in January from 4.1% the month prior. 143,000 new jobs were created in January, less than the 170,000 expected by economists, and lower than the 307,000 seen in December. December's monthly job gains were revised higher from a previous reading of 256,000. Read more here. Stocks in Europe wavered on Friday but were on track for weekly gains after a run of robust earnings reports from Novo Nordisk (NVO, NOVO-B.CO) and others. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index was holding steady, not far off record highs as it eyed its seventh weekly win in a row. In 2025 so far, European stocks have notched their best performance compared with their US counterparts in around 10 years. In individual benchmarks, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) edged up 0.1%, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris traded flat. London's FTSE 100 index (^FTSE) slipped roughly 0.3%, after surging on Thursday on the heels of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England that came with unexpectedly dovish commentary.

Investors are watching for cracks in the market's stability, as they eye President Donald Trump's tariff push and the chances of higher inflation. But Friday's reading likely won't be a game-changer, as economists are keeping alive bets that no rate cut will arrive until the central bank's June meeting. Meanwhile, eyes were on Amazon's (AMZN) earnings after it joined Google (GOOG) and other AI-focused Big Tech companies in disappointing Wall Street with its revenue outlook. Shares in Amazon dropped more than 2% in early trading, echoing post-results pullbacks for Google and AMD (AMD) amid doubts about high AI development spending. But the three major stock gauges are on track to close the earnings-packed week with small gains, even after unpredictable tariff news from Trump kept traders on their toes. The president has now set his eyes on hedge funds, with a plan to close a favorite tax deduction loophole for fund managers. An adjustment to the closely watched state and local tax (SALT) deduction was also on his administration's list of tax priorities outlined on Thursday.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 07, 2025 09:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Sales of Eli Lilly’s (LLY) blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound doubled in the fourth quarter year over year, despite missing the company’s initial sales expectations. Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of the popular GLP-1 medications Wegovy and Ozempic, said potential tariffs on Europe proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could affect its business. Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla told investors on Tuesday that he is “cautiously optimistic” about collaborating with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is expected to become the next head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Check out those stories and more pharmaceutical news highlights from this week. 2 / 10 A pharma industry group is urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to block what it calls a “dangerous” Super Bowl ad from the digital healthcare company Hims & Hers (HIMS), promoting an off-brand version of Ozempic. “This is a clear attempt by industry groups to cancel an advertisement that directly calls out how they are part of a system that fails to prioritize the health of Americans,” Hims & Hers said in a statement to Quartz. Read More 3 / 10 Sales of Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound surged in the fourth quarter despite missing the company’s initial sales expectations. Zepbound sales reached $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $176 million during the same period in 2023 — when it first launched. Despite impressive sales, Eli Lilly previously warned investors that growth for the medication didn’t meet its initial high expectations this past quarter. The company revised its fourth-quarter guidance last month, citing weaker-than-expected demand. Read More 4 / 10 Novo Nordisk, the maker of the popular GLP-1 medications Wegovy and Ozempic, said potential tariffs on Europe imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could affect its business. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that the company was “not immune” to potential tariffs. Still, he remains confident that the Danish pharma giant is in a “good position to meet the demands of the new [U.S.] administration.” Read More 5 / 10 Sales of Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy doubled in the fourth quarter, but the Danish pharmaceutical giant warns that sales growth for all its drugs — including Ozempic — is expected to slow in the coming year. Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Read More 6 / 10 Big Pharma is downplaying — for now — the potential negative impacts of President Donald Trump’s China tariffs on their industry. Merck (MRK) chief financial officer Caroline Litchfield told investors Tuesday during an earnings call that the company expects “a very immaterial impact” from the tariffs. The tariffs did not come up at all during Pfizer or Amgen’s (AMGN) earnings calls on Tuesday. Read More 7 / 10 Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told investors Tuesday morning that he is “cautiously optimistic” about working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the expected next head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Bourla was asked during a call with investors how the company plans to work with Kennedy — given his views on vaccines and skepticism of the pharma industry. The Senate Finance Committee advanced Kennedy’s nomination on Tuesday. Read More 8 / 10 Pharma industry groups are sounding the alarm, warning that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could worsen drug shortages, drive up prices, and push generic manufacturers out of the U.S. Read More 9 / 10 Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game.

US stock futures edged lower on Friday as investors digested a highly anticipated monthly jobs report and Amazon's (AMZN) disappointing revenue outlook. Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) tipped 0.1% lower on the heels of a mixed day for stocks on Wall Street. The US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, less than the 173,000 expected by economists, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.0%, versus expectations of 4.1%. The jobs report has become more crucial to hopes for another Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Investors are watching for cracks in the market's stability, as they eye President Donald Trump's tariff push and the chances of higher inflation. But Friday's reading likely won't be a game-changer for the Fed, economists believe, keeping alive bets that no rate cut will arrive until the central bank's June meeting. Meanwhile, eyes were on Amazon's (AMZN) earnings after it joined Google (GOOG) and other AI-focused Big Tech companies in disappointing Wall Street with its revenue outlook. Shares in Amazon dropped around 3% in pre-market trading, echoing post-results pullbacks for Google and AMD (AMD) amid doubts about high AI development spending. But the three major stock gauges are on track to close the earnings-packed week with small gains, even after unpredictable tariff news from Trump kept traders on their toes. The president has now set his eyes on hedge funds, with a plan to close a favorite tax deduction loophole for fund managers. An adjustment to the closely watched state and local tax (SALT) deduction was also on his administration's list of tax priorities outlined on Thursday. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: The US labor market showed continued signs of resilience in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and wages grew more than expected. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 4% in January from 4.1% the month prior. 143,000 new jobs were created in January, less than the 170,000 expected by economists, and lower than the 307,000 seen in December. December's monthly job gains were revised higher from a previous reading of 256,000. Read more here. Stocks in Europe wavered on Friday but were on track for weekly gains after a run of robust earnings reports from Novo Nordisk (NVO, NOVO-B.CO) and others. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index was holding steady, not far off record highs as it eyed its seventh weekly win in a row. In 2025 so far, European stocks have notched their best performance compared with their US counterparts in around 10 years. In individual benchmarks, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) edged up 0.1%, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris traded flat. London's FTSE 100 index (^FTSE) slipped roughly 0.3%, after surging on Thursday on the heels of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England that came with unexpectedly dovish commentary. Economic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls (January); Unemployment rate (January); Average hourly earnings and Average weekly hours worked (January); Labor force participation rate (January); Annual revisions to the employment establishment survey expected; University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey (February preliminary) Earnings: Canopy Growth (CGC), Newell Brands (NWL) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Jobs report expected to send 'comforting signal' on economy Amazon's revenue finally overtakes Walmart Trump tariffs are already having an impact on Canada: BOC gov. Chinese tech stocks enter bull market amid DeepSeek buzz Winklevoss twins' crypto exchange Gemini is said to weigh IPO Traders see profits evaporate in minutes as Trump convulses bets YF columnist Rick Newman: Even Republicans are souring on Musk Tesla's China-made EV sales drop 11.5% in January Chinese tech stock trading in Hong Kong was poised to enter a technical bull market after DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence model ignited interest in China’s internet firms.
