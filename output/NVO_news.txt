Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO)Class Period: May 7, 2025 – July 28, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: LINE)Class Period: July 22. 2025 – August 1, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that the Registration Statement made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Lineage was then experiencing sustained weakening in customer demand, as additional cold-storage supply had come on line, the Company’s customers destocked a glut of excessive inventory built up during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company’s customers shifted to maintaining leaner cold-storage inventories on a go-forward basis in response to changed consumer trends; (2) that Lineage had implemented price increases in the lead-up to the IPO that could not be sustained in light of the weakening demand environment facing the Company; (3) that Lineage was unable to effectively counteract the adverse trends listed in the foregoing through the use of minimum storage guarantees or as a result of operational efficiencies, technological improvements, or its purported competitive advantages; (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, rather than enjoying stable revenue growth, high occupancy rates, and steady rent escalation as represented in the Registration Statement, Lineage was in fact suffering from stagnant or falling revenue, occupancy rates, and rent prices; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

September 29, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: The Gross Law Firm The Gross Law Firm NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Gross Law Firm issues the following notice to shareholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). Shareholders who purchased shares of NVO during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/novo-nordisk-a-s-loss-submission-form-3/?id=169631&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 7, 2025 to July 28, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

September 29, 2025 16:03 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Here's Why Morgan Stanley Analysts Downgraded Novo Nordisk's Stock

Time Published: 2025-09-29T17:53:22Z
Full Content:
An analyst's concerns about demand for Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drugs is weighing on the drugmaker's shares to start the week. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slid in recent trading following a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about demand for the company's GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as their effectiveness in fighting Alzheimer’s disease. The bank dropped its rating to “underweight” from “equal weight,” and lowered the price target to $47 from $59. The stock was recently down less than 1% to below $55, slightly extending year-to-date declines. Morgan Stanley has downgraded Novo Nordisk, whose U.S. shares are already down a third this year. That downgrade forecasts slowing demand for weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, generic competition abroad, and trial results that may disappoint those looking for an Alzheimer’s breakthrough. Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that “prescriptions for Ozempic and Wegovy have been stagnating in the US; we forecast a decline in the US GLP-1 diabetes franchise in 2026 due to market share and price pressure, and we expect Ozempic ex-US growth to be impacted by the first generic competition in Canada and emerging markets.” The analysts said that they believe the results of trials of Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 treatments for Alzheimer’s disease coming in the next few week will likely fall short of showing statistically significant outcomes. AndtThey warned about the downside risks of potential price cuts for Ozempic and Wegovy in Medicare Part D plans, as well as doubts about the company’s experimental obesity/diabetes combination drug CagriSemi outperforming rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost a third of their value this year.
