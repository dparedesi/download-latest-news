August 04, 2025 15:43 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National plaintiffs’ law firm Berger Montague PC announces a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) (“Novo” or the “Company”) on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of Novo from May 7, 2025 through July 28, 2025 (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Novo securities during the Class Period may, no later than September 30, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Novo, headquartered in Denmark, is a global pharmaceutical company. According to the Complaint, the Company is alleged to have understated the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion, which has allowed persistent use of compounded alternatives to Novo’s pharmaceutical products. Novo allegedly overstated the likelihood that patients using less expensive compounded drugs would switch to its branded products, thus greatly overstating the Company’s ability to sustain long-term growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook for fiscal 2025. The Company cited slower-than-expected growth for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®, attributing the guidance revision to continued competition from compounded GLP-1 products. Following this announcement, Novo’s stock price dropped from a closing price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to a close of $53.94 per share on July 29—a decline of approximately 21.83% in a single day.

Title: Watch These Novo Nordisk Stock Price Levels After Last Week's 33% Drop
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-novo-nordisk-stock-price-levels-after-33-percent-drop-last-week-11784032

Full Content:
Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares were up about 2% in recent trading after shedding about a third of their value last week, when the company cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO, leading Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock. Since hitting a record high in June last year, Novo Nordisk shares have lost roughly two-thirds of their value, pressured by increasing competition from rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) weight-loss drugs and challenges during trials of the company’s next-generation obesity drugs. Below, we take a closer look at Novo Nordisk’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching after last week’s dramatic sell-off. With last week's drop, Novo Nordisk shares resumed their steep downtrend on above-average trading volume, indicating selling conviction from larger market participants. The sell-off coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) falling to its lowest levels since early May, signaling weakening price momentum, though the indicator neared its oversold threshold, increasing the chances for short-term bounces. It’s also worth noting that the 50-week moving average continues to converge toward the 200-week MA, potentially setting the stage for an ominous death cross, a bearish pattern that forecasts lower prices. Let’s identify two major support levels on Novo Nordisk’s chart worth watching if selling resumes this week and also point out several key overhead areas to monitor during potential recovery efforts. The first major lower level to watch sits around $36. This area would likely provide support near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between October 2020 and April 2021. A more significant move lower could see the shares test lower support at the $29 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding price action on the chart between January 2018 and April 2020. An initial recovery effort could see the shares climb to overhead resistance around $60. The price may encounter selling pressure in this area near the prominent April trough and April 2022 peak. A more bullish upswing opens the door for a rally toward $78. Investors who have bought Novo Nordisk shares at lower levels may decide to lock in profits in this location near the June peak, which closely aligns with the completion of a pullback in July 2023.

Last week brought a string of blockbuster corporate reports. Those will continue in the days ahead, with big tech companies and well-known consumer names set to publish their quarterly financial updates. AI data analyst firm Palantir, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, and ride-hailing app Uber Technologies lead the tech names set to report. McDonald’s and Walt Disney are among the leading consumer companies on the calendar. Several noteworthy drugmakers are also scheduled to post earnings, including Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariffs are remaking the landscape of international trade, while factory orders could help show whether tariffs are helping spur a rise in domestic manufacturing so far. Trade weighed heavily on stocks to close out last week, with concerns about tariffs and the health of the job market pulling all three major indexes into the red after a generally strong July. Consumer credit data later in the week will provide insight into how much Americans are spending. Market watchers will also be following comments from Federal Reserve officials after last week’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Palantir Technologies’ (PLTR) scheduled earnings report on Monday kicks off the week for investors as the firm continues to trade near record highs, lifted by optimism about AI spending trends. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is to report the following day, with analysts saying the chipmaker’s MI350 series chips could be competitive with Nvidia products. Analysts are also high on Uber Technologies (UBER) ahead of its scheduled report on Wednesday. McDonald’s (MCD) reportm on tap for Wednesday, is due as the burger chain has reported that traffic from middle-income households was down amid lagging consumer confidence. Disney’s (DIS) scheduled report on the same day follows the entertainment giant lifting its full-year profit outlook in the prior quarter amid subscriber growth in its streaming services. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) expected Wednesday report comes after the Danish drugmaker lowered its full-year outlook amid declining sales of its weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Eli Lilly’s (LLY) report set for Thursday follows cuts to its profit outlook in May against the backdrop of high research and development costs. U.S. trade deficit data, due Tuesday, will provide market watchers with more insight into how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are affecting international trade. The data comes as the gap between imports and exports is narrowing as the tariffs take hold. Areport on second-quarter productivity comes as market watchers look for the impact of AI on the workforce. Updated consumer credit data will be released as economists closely watch the health of the U.S. consumer. Meanwhile, investors will also be alert to weekly jobless claims on Thursday following last week’s employment report. After two members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted last week to cut interest rates, investors will be tracking public comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem for more insight into what's next for the central bank.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.
