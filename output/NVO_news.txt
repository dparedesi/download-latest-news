NEW YORK, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Eli Lilly Weight-Loss Pill Trial Disappoints, Offsetting Solid Profit and Sales

Ely Lilly (LLY) shares sank 14% Thursday when the pharmaceutical firm reported disappointing results from a late-stage study of its experimental obesity pill. The news offset Lilly's strong quarterly results. The company said in a Phase 3 trial, patients taking a 36 milligram dose of its oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, without food and water restrictions showed an average weight loss of 12.4%, or 27.3 pounds, in a 72-week period. That's below the 15% average weight loss of rival Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy injectable treatment. Some on Wall Street were looking for orforglipron to come in closer to that level. In an interview, Lilly CEO David Ricks argued that the company wasn't disappointed with the results even though they were "one or two points below what (the) Street had." Ricks added the goal was to create a pill that was convenient to take, could be made on a huge scale, and would provide weight loss that was competitive with other GLP-1 medicines, "and that's what we've achieved." The company explained that it plans to seek regulatory approval of orforglipron by the end of the year. Along with the orforglipron announcement, Lilly released its second-quarter financial data Thursday, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $6.31, with revenue up 38% year-over-year to $15.56 billion. Both exceeded Visible Alpha forecasts by a wide margin. The gains came from soaring demand for its current weight-loss drug, Zepbound, which had a 172% jump in sales to $3.38 billion. Sales of another GLP-1, Mounjaro, used to treat both obesity and Type-2 diabetes, were up 68% to $5.20 billion. Lilly raised its full-year adjusted EPS range to $21.75 to $23.00, compared to the earlier estimate of $20.78 to $22.28. It sees revenue of $60 billion to $62. billion, versus the previous outlook of $58 billion to $61 billion. Shares of Eli Lilly traded at their lowest level since January 2024. However, the study outcome lifted U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk 7%. TradingView

Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company, focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical productions globally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Misled the Market About its 2025 Revenue and Profit Growth Potential According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Novo Nordisk's representations regarding its growth potential were overstated and failed to account for the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion; (2) defendants misrepresented the likelihood that patients using compounded GLP-1s would transition to Novo Nordisk's branded alternatives; and (3) Novo Nordisk significantly overstated both the size of the GLP-1 market and its ability to penetrate that market to sustain growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on "lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025" for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to "the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expectations and competition." On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk's common stock declined from $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025.

August 05, 2025 16:19 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=159602&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically.

August 04, 2025 15:43 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National plaintiffs’ law firm Berger Montague PC announces a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) (“Novo” or the “Company”) on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of Novo from May 7, 2025 through July 28, 2025 (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Novo securities during the Class Period may, no later than September 30, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Novo, headquartered in Denmark, is a global pharmaceutical company. According to the Complaint, the Company is alleged to have understated the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion, which has allowed persistent use of compounded alternatives to Novo’s pharmaceutical products. Novo allegedly overstated the likelihood that patients using less expensive compounded drugs would switch to its branded products, thus greatly overstating the Company’s ability to sustain long-term growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook for fiscal 2025. The Company cited slower-than-expected growth for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®, attributing the guidance revision to continued competition from compounded GLP-1 products. Following this announcement, Novo’s stock price dropped from a closing price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to a close of $53.94 per share on July 29—a decline of approximately 21.83% in a single day.

Title: Watch These Novo Nordisk Stock Price Levels After Last Week's 33% Drop
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-novo-nordisk-stock-price-levels-after-33-percent-drop-last-week-11784032
Time Published: 2025-08-04T18:29:55Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares were up about 2% in recent trading after shedding about a third of their value last week, when the company cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO, leading Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock. Since hitting a record high in June last year, Novo Nordisk shares have lost roughly two-thirds of their value, pressured by increasing competition from rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) weight-loss drugs and challenges during trials of the company’s next-generation obesity drugs. Below, we take a closer look at Novo Nordisk’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching after last week’s dramatic sell-off. With last week's drop, Novo Nordisk shares resumed their steep downtrend on above-average trading volume, indicating selling conviction from larger market participants. The sell-off coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) falling to its lowest levels since early May, signaling weakening price momentum, though the indicator neared its oversold threshold, increasing the chances for short-term bounces. It’s also worth noting that the 50-week moving average continues to converge toward the 200-week MA, potentially setting the stage for an ominous death cross, a bearish pattern that forecasts lower prices. Let’s identify two major support levels on Novo Nordisk’s chart worth watching if selling resumes this week and also point out several key overhead areas to monitor during potential recovery efforts. The first major lower level to watch sits around $36. This area would likely provide support near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between October 2020 and April 2021. A more significant move lower could see the shares test lower support at the $29 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding price action on the chart between January 2018 and April 2020. An initial recovery effort could see the shares climb to overhead resistance around $60. The price may encounter selling pressure in this area near the prominent April trough and April 2022 peak. A more bullish upswing opens the door for a rally toward $78. Investors who have bought Novo Nordisk shares at lower levels may decide to lock in profits in this location near the June peak, which closely aligns with the completion of a pullback in July 2023.
