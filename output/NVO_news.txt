Title: Novo Nordisk stock tumbled over the latest results for its experimental weight loss pill
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-stock-monlunabant-weight-loss-trial-1851653608
Time Published: 2024-09-20T14:59:00Z
Full Content:
Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced mixed results today for a phase 2 trial of an experimental weight loss pill that works differently than its already-popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 6% during Friday morning trading after it posted the results. The Danish pharma giant tested monlunabant, a drug it acquired in 2023 with its $1 billion purchase of Inversago Pharma, in a phase 2 trial involving 243 participants with obesity and other related health complications. Monlunabant works by blocking CB1 receptors, which are found in the brain and nervous system and have an effect on appetite. Conversely, Wegovy works by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and reduces appetite. The new drug was tested in once-daily doses of 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg. Starting from an average weight of 110.1 kg (242.7 lbs), participants taking any dose of monlunabant lost significantly more weight than those on a placebo. After 16 weeks, people taking a daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant lost an average of 7.1 kg (15.6 lbs), or about 6% of their weight, while the placebo group only lost about 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Higher doses didn’t result in much more weight loss beyond that. In the trial, the most common side effects were digestive issues, which were generally mild to moderate and depended on the dose. People taking monlunabant also reported more mild-to-moderate mood-related side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep problems, compared to those on a placebo. However, Novo Nordisk reported no severe neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Novo Nordisk said it is plans to start a larger phase 2 trial of the drug in 2025.

Title: Bernie Sanders says drugmakers could sell generic Ozempic for less than $100

Time Published: 2024-09-17T20:35:00Z

Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for hundreds of dollars cheaper than the popular diabetes drug’s current list price. “They have studied the math, and they tell me that they can sell a generic version of Ozempic, the exact same drug that Novo Nordisk (NVO) is manufacturing, to Americans for less than $100 a month,” Sanders said at an expert roundtable event he hosted in Capitol Hill. Sanders, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), made the comments just a week before Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen is set to testify before the committee to address the pharma giant’s high U.S. prices. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month (its retail price is $968.52), well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. “We appreciate that it is frustrating that each country has its own healthcare system but making isolated and limited comparisons ignores this fundamental fact,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “We have and will continue to cooperate with policymakers on real solutions and are proud of the benefit our discoveries have brought to treat and defeat chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity.” The company spokesperson added that the net price of Ozempic has fallen 40% since launching in the U.S. and that over 80% of Americans with insurance only pay $25 or less per month for the drug.

Title: Ozempic will likely get cheaper for millions on Medicare, Novo exec says

Ozempic, the blockbuster diabetes treatment by Novo Nordisk (NVO), is ‘very likely’ to see its price cut as part of the second round of Medicare drug price negotiation in 2025, an executive from the Danish pharma giant said on Tuesday. Bloomberg reported that Ulrich Otte, Novo Nordisk senior vice president of finance & operations, made the comment at the Cantor Global Healthcare Conference in New York. “It is very likely that Ozempic will be part of negotiations in the coming round, and we’re ready for that,” Otte said, according to the outlet. The company’s stock dipped over 3% during midday trading on Tuesday. “We can’t speculate on which Novo Nordisk medicines will be selected for future negotiations with [the] Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “We have opposed government price setting through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and have serious concerns about how the law is being implemented.” The IRA, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed for CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up the most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced in August the lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. CMS is set to select 15 more drugs for price negotiations by February 2025. Otte’s comments come as several prominent government officials have already called for price cuts of the popular diabetes medication. In a July op-ed, President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the high prices Novo Nordisk and other pharmaceutical companies charge Americans for weight loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 treatments. Novo Nordisk produces the the popular Ozempic and Wegovy brands, and Eli Lilly (LLY) is the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed to testify in September before the Senate’s health committee to address the pharma giant’s high U.S. prices. Jørgensen agreed to testify just days after after Sanders, chairman of Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), called a vote to subpoena a Novo Nordisk executive. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster drugs. At the time, the senator also warned that the drugs could potentially bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid. He cited researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago that said it could cost more than $150 billion a year for Medicare to cover Wegovy and other weight loss drugs. In June, the committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month (its retail price is $968.52), well above the drug’s price in other countries. Ozempic in Germany costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Monlunabant, formerly INV-202, was part of the acquisition of Inversago Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced in August 2023 [Link]. The trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of monlunabant compared to placebo on body weight after 16 weeks in 243 people with obesity and metabolic syndrome1. People were equally randomised among the four treatment arms. From a baseline body weight of 110.1 kg, all doses of monlunabant achieved a statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. After 16 weeks of treatment, people treated with a once-daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant achieved a weight loss of 7.1 kg compared to a reduction of 0.7 kg with placebo2. Limited additional weight loss was seen at higher doses of monlunabant. In the trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being mild to moderate and dose dependent. Reporting of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, was more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported in relation to neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a larger phase 2b trial in obesity to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant over a longer duration in a global population. The phase 2b trial is expected to be initiated in 2025.
