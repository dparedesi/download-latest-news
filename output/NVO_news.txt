Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY-6.52%) thinks its next experimental weight-loss pill could get approved as soon as early 2026. CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News on Monday that data on the drug, orforglipron, is expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory clearance the following year, Ricks said in an interview at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference (JPM+0.86%) in San Francisco. Ricks also said that pills would be easier to manufacture en masse, and more simple for patients to consume, than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Eli Lilly’s popular Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-4.42%) Wegovy and Ozempic, although a few pills have emerged; Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes.

Zepbound was only taken off the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list in October, while tirzepatide — the active ingredient in both drugs — was taken off in December. Eli Lilly is building a $9 billion manufacturing complex in Lebanon, Indiana, to produce key components for its GLP-1 drugs, including tirzepatide, alongside a $4.5 billion research center. It’s also invested several billion dollars in facilities in Ireland and Germany. “We will continue to increase supply, but taking into account the huge need there would probably continue to be supply constraints until we had an oral medicine with an injectable-like efficacy,” President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in May. “I think this is really an opportunity to reach more patients and also the ones that are currently fearful of injections,” Jonsson added. Surging demand for these drugs transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.75%) analysts anticipate the global market for the highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. In a boost to both companies, Zepbound and Wegovy have been approved for Medicare coverage. The newly expanded coverage could help many patients, as insurers have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Zepbound costs $1,086.37 per month without insurance. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump’s play for Greenland could make Ozempic more expensive

Denmark is the latest in a series of countries that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened with tariffs — joining a list that includes the 26 other nations of the European Union, as well as Canada and Mexico. However, if he follows through with imposing tariffs on imports coming from Denmark, it could drive up the already expensive cost of one of America’s fastest-growing obsessions: weight-loss drugs. Earlier this week, during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump said he would impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Greenland, a North American island with a population of nearly 60,000, is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Denmark ranks just 41st on the list of top U.S. trading partners, the two countries exchanged over $16 billion worth of goods in 2023. Denmark’s top export into the U.S. is packaged medicine, which makes sense considering it is home to pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO-4.42%). The company is the maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH in 2023. The Danish pharma giant even helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to have done so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, projects that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, driven primarily by Novo Nordisk. The popular drugs work by mimicking gut hormones that help regulate blood sugar and curb appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss benefits. According to Morgan Stanley (MS+0.75%) analysts, the global market for this class of medications could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, the bank projects that around 31.5 million people — or nearly 10% of the population — will be using these type of drugs by 2035. It’s unclear how tariffs on Denmark might affect the price of these medications, which can cost more than $1,000 without insurance, as Novo Nordisk manufactures them at facilities around the world. In June, the company announced it was investing over $4 billion to boost its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
