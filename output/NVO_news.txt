March 10, 2025 17:37 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Eli Lilly's first weight-loss pill could expand access to GLP-1s around the globe, executive says

Time Published: 2025-03-10T18:31:00Z
Full Content:
Eli Lilly (LLY-0.24%) believes its experimental weight-loss pill could make GLP-1 treatments more accessible worldwide. “We feel that a product like an oral, orforglipron, could serve a significant amount of patients globally,” Eli Lilly CFO Lucas Montarce said Monday at the Leerink (SIVB) 2025 Global Healthcare Conference. Montarce laid out several reasons why a pill could broaden access to the GLP-1 class of drugs, which was made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-4.02%) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.84%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. Montarce said their are many markets where patients prefer an oral option over an injection — like the current GLP-1s on the market. Pills are also cheaper and more simple to produce and distribute than injections, making them easier to scale globally. Additionally, government and insurance providers may be more likely to cover an oral medication over an injectable, potentially expanding access through public health systems. Orforglipron is currently in a phase 3 trial. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News in January that phase 3 trial results are expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory approval for the drug in 2026. At the time, Ricks said that a pill would be easier to manufacture en masse — and more simple for patients to consume — than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Zepbound, Wegovy, and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is also working on a GLP-1 weight-loss pill. Last, year the company said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of its pill, amycretin, lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 10, 2025 14:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Novo Nordisk's Ozempic successor disappointed Wall Street again

Time Published: 2025-03-10T14:31:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO-4.02%) released clinical trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Monday, disappointing Wall Street for the second time. The pharmaceutical giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, announced on Monday that patients taking its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema, lost an average of 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks in a phase 3 clinical trial. This was the second of four planned phase 3 studies of the drug. The first trial, called REDEFINE 1, tested CagriSema in people who were obese or overweight but did not have type 2 diabetes. In that study, patients lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The second study, REDEFINE 2, focused on 1,206 patients who were obese or overweight and had type 2 diabetes. Neither trial met the company’s or analysts’ expectations of a 25% average weight loss. Novo Nordisk had hoped that by mimicking multiple hormones, CagriSema would deliver greater weight loss. The drug combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.24%) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk’s stock fell more than 8% on Monday morning following the news. “We had believed that adults living with both overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes represent the patient segment for which CagriSema has the best chance to outperform Zepbound. Therefore, we believe today’s results are especially disappointing,” William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh wrote in a note. CagriSema belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, popularized by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.84%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. As a result, several pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss medications. Novo Nordisk currently plans to file for regulatory approval for CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. Meanwhile, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+11.22%) and Amgen (AMGN-1.62%), which are also developing next-generation weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 3.5% and 1%, respectively, on Monday.

March 10, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 March 2025 – Today, Novo Nordisk announced headline results from REDEFINE 2, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 2 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to placebo. The trial included 1,206 randomised people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes and a mean baseline body weight of 102 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 2 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 61.9% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 15.7% after 68 weeks compared to 3.1% with placebo. Weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks was a co-primary endpoint and was achieved by 89.7% of patients on CagriSema, compared to 30.3% by placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 13.7% compared to 3.4% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “The REDEFINE 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes”, said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. The detailed results from REDEFINE 1 and REDEFINE 2 will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. The phase 3 trial programme includes: REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,417 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – an 84-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
