Future GLP-1 drugs will launch at a capped price of $149 under the terms of the agreement. For the first time, Medicare will cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity, with patient co-pays set at roughly $50. The administration also introduced a federal purchasing option that will allow consumers to buy GLP-1 drugs directly through a government website called “TrumpRX.” “Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to provide all of their other medications to Medicaid at 'most favored nations' prices, meaning you will pay the lowest price anywhere in the world,” President Donald Trump said during the press conference. Trump also highlighted the fact that the project bears his name. “They want to use my name, Trump. Better be good,” he said. “I think it’s turning out to be pretty amazing.” Trump added that the companies planned major U.S. manufacturing investments to support expanded supply, saying they “are building new plants” to produce GLP-1 medications domestically. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic a natural hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and appetite. They were originally developed for diabetes, but have become widely used for weight loss because they slow digestion, reduce hunger, and help control blood glucose levels. Officials said the pricing changes were part of a broader effort to expand access to obesity and diabetes treatments. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) both jumped following the announcement, with LLY still recently up about 1% to $936, while NVO is down about 4% to $46 a share amid a broader daily decline for stocks. Administration officials said about 10% of Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for coverage under the new plan, based on criteria tied to body mass index and preexisting conditions such as prediabetes and cardiovascular disease. Eligible patients would pay a $50 monthly co-pay, with the change expected to take effect in the middle of next year. Officials also said some Medicaid enrollees could gain access to lower prices beginning in 2027 through a forthcoming pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump previewed his approach in February, telling Fox News, “The so-called fat drug or fat shot, whatever it’s called, Ozempic or Mounjaro—in London, you get it for $88. In New York, you get it for $1,200, you can’t even buy it. It’s very unfair… I’m going to solve it one way or the other.” Not present during the press conferences were representatives of major insurers, who did not say whether they would change their coverage rules in response to the new prices. Until now, plans have had limited access largely because of the high cost of the drugs and the large number of patients seeking them for weight-loss treatment. During the press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement would broaden access for patients who had been unable to afford GLP-1 drugs. “Obesity is the number one driver of chronic disease. Fifty percent of our adult population are obese or overweight, and it drives about 50% of healthcare costs in this country,” Kennedy said. “We are going to see a decline because of this historic agreement. We’re going to see a decline in costs, but also, more importantly, in the afflictions themselves.” The negotiations took “months and months,” Kennedy added, and described the resulting deal as poised to provide “the biggest impact on the American people” among recent health policy moves. The administration did not say when commercial insurers might adjust their coverage policies. Officials said final implementation of the Medicare provisions would be completed after further review. “This is a great day for American health and health care,” President Trump said. “For all American patients, these are things that are miracles.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

November 06, 2025 13:01 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 6 November 2025 – Today it was announced that Novo Nordisk has agreed with the U.S. Administration to lower drug prices beginning in 2026 and expand patient access and affordability for semaglutide medicines, including Wegovy® and Ozempic®, in U.S. Medicare Part D and Medicaid and in direct-to-patient cash channel. Medicare Part D coverage for anti-obesity medicines will be enabled through a pilot program designed to cover a majority of Part D beneficiaries. In addition, Novo Nordisk is expected to receive a three-year tariff exemption. “Novo Nordisk has always worked to secure affordable access to our innovative medicines, and today’s announcement will bring semaglutide medicines to more American patients at a lower cost” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “Importantly, this also expands obesity medication access in Medicare, which will allow people living with obesity to access authentic Wegovy®”.

Title: No Brainer Dividend Stocks To Buy Now

Investing Realty Income (O) reported $1.08 FFO per share in Q3 with revenue up 10.5% year-over-year to $1.47B. United Parcel Service (UPS) plans to generate $3.5B in cost savings while focusing on high-margin areas. Pfizer (PFE) raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.00-$3.15 and targets $7.7B in net cost savings by 2027. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. You cannot know the power of an investment unless you see the returns. Many think of dividend stocks as a way of generating cash income from their portfolio, but if you handle the income well, you can generate a higher total return through dividend reinvestment while boosting the long-term capital appreciation potential. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Realty Income (NYSE:O) are no-brainer dividend stocks to own right now. If you’re chasing long-term growth, you need to make dividend stocks an important part of your portfolio. They’re reliable, have an upside potential, and generate regular income. However, when picking dividend stocks, quality matters more than quantity. Here’s why they are no-brainer stocks that stand out in the industry. Realty Income is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that has a history of 112 consecutive quarterly dividend increases. This means about 28 years of quarterly dividend increases. The company takes pride in calling itself “The Monthly Dividend Company” since it pays monthly dividends and has a yield of 5.5%. Realty Income owns properties across the globe and has triple net leases on them. This allows the company to ensure steady rental income while keeping the operating costs at a minimum. The insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs are borne by the tenants, allowing the REIT to generate a higher cash flow and sustain dividends. In the third quarter results, the funds from operations (FFO) stood at $1.08 per share, and the revenue came in around $1.47 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. The management has adjusted the full year guidance upwards and has a positive outlook for future growth. It has an occupancy rate of 98.7%, signalling confidence towards the business. During the quarter, it invested $1.36 billion across 123 properties and properties under development. Realty Income has a payout ratio of 75.29% and has an annual payout of $3.23 per share. Exchanging hands for $56.12, Realty Income stock has gained 6.6% in 2025 but has lost value over the last six months. This dip is a buying opportunity for income investors. RBC Capital has a price target of $61 with an Outperform rating. iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Logistics company United Parcel Service is known for the high yield and sustainable dividends. It has a juicy yield of 7.06% and has raised dividends for 16 consecutive years. Exchanging hands for $92, UPS is a solid buy below $100. The stock has lost 25% value in 2025 and has gone from the 52-week high of $138 to $92 today. Despite the dip, the dividend isn’t under any threat. United Parcel Service has increased dividends for over a decade, and while the future dividend growth may slow down, the payout rate will remain secure. UPS has seen a dip in earnings due to tariffs and inflation. However, the management has laid out a plan to generate $3.5 billion in savings. It is also focusing on high-margin areas and has reduced Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) deliveries. This could lead to margin expansion in the long term, allowing UPS to maintain the dividend growth streak. The company managed to beat estimates in the recently announced third-quarter results. Its revenue came in at $21.4 billion, while the EPS stood at $1.74. It reported a net income of $1.31 billion and expects fourth quarter revenue of $24 billion. The company has reduced the workforce significantly and is looking for other ways to cut costs. United Parcel Service has a payout ratio of 86.99%, and the annual payout is $6.56. It has a 5-year dividend growth rate of 10.42%, and its cash flow supports the dividend payout. I think the company’s turnaround has just begun, and there’s a lot more upside potential. It is a high-yield stock trading at a discount. Alexandros Michailidis / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Pfizer Inc. is slowly bouncing back and gaining traction. The company beat estimates in the third quarter results, and despite the fall in income, the management raised full-year guidance. It reported a revenue of $16.6 billion and an EPS of $0.87, down 18% year over year. This drop was due to the one-time adjustment towards a licensing deal with 3SBio. Pfizer is working on cost reduction measures to improve margins. It aims to achieve net cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of 2025 and $7.7 billion by the end of 2027. The cost savings will be invested towards research and development for improving the pipeline programs. The management expects the full-year EPS in the range of $3 to $3.15, up from the previous outlook of $2.90 to $3.10. The company is in a clash for Metsera with Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). Pfizer was set to acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, which could give it a golden ticket to enter the obesity market. However, Novo Nordisk bid at $6 billion, triggering a bidding war. Pfizer has upgraded its bid to $8.1 billion. Pfizer is seeing high demand for its recent launches and acquired drugs, and the growth from these products could help offset the looming patent cliff losses. The management remains committed to dividend and will be working to improve shareholder value. Pfizer has a payout ratio of 13.13% and an annual dividend of $1.72. It has reported a 5-year dividend growth of 3.77%.

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) fell after the drugmaker scaled back its outlook, citing disappointing demand for its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs as competition in the sector increases. Novo Nordisk, the company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of DK4.50 ($0.69), DK20 ($0.03) below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Revenue was up 5.1% to DK74.98 billion ($11.53 billion), also short of forecasts. Novo Nordisk’s weaker results indicate mounting pressure in the weight-loss drug market that it once dominated. The maker of Ozempic and Wegovy is facing tougher competition, slower demand, and pricing pressures—and has now cut its full-year outlook for the fourth time in 2025. Wegovy sales rose 18% to DK20.35 billion ($3.13 billion), below expectations. Ozempic sales added 3% to DK30.74 billion ($4.73 billion), better than anticipated. The company now sees full-year operating profit growth of 4% to 7%, and sales of 8% to 11%. The previous outlook was for operating profit to gain 4% to 20% and sales to advance 8% to 14%. It said the change “reflects lowered growth expectations for Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 treatments within diabetes and obesity.” It's the fourth time the company narrowed its guidance this year. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost about 46% of their value this year. The shares were recently off about 4%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.
