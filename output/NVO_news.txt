[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) fell sharply for a second straight day Wednesday, this time after Bank of America downgraded the stock. On Tuesday, the stock plummeted nearly 22% after the Danish drugmaker cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO. The maker of blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy said it now expects 2025 sales growth at constant exchange rates of 8% to 14%, down from its early May forecast of 13% to 21%. In response, Bank of America analysts wrote Wednesday that they were downgrading the stock to "neutral" from "buy," and lowering their price target to 375 Danish kroner from 550 Danish kroner. The analysts also reduced their earnings forecasts for the company for the next several years based on trends expected in the second half of this year and more pressure anticipated in 2026 and 2027. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares were down 6% in recent trading Wednesday. They have lost more than 40% of their value in 2025 and are down about 60% over the past 12 months.

U.S. equities were mixed at midday as the market responded to the U.S. economy growing more than expected in the second quarter while waiting for today’s decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell. Humana (HUM) shares advanced after the health insurer boosted its guidance and reported better-than-expected results as it sees a smaller decline in Medicare Advantage membership this year than previously believed. Shares of Hershey (HSY) rose when the chocolate, candy, and snacks maker also beat profit and sales estimates on high Easter and pre-Halloween demand for its treats. VF Corp. (VFC) shares took off after the parent of North Face, Vans, and Timberland brands surprised analysts with flat revenue and a smaller loss, raising confidence the company's turnaround plan is working. Old Dominion Freight Lines (ODFL) shares were driven down when the freight delivery firm missed earnings and revenue forecasts, which it blamed on ongoing softness in the U.S. economy. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) continued their slide on a downgrade from Bank of America. That came after the drugmaker warned about weakening sales of its blockbuster weight-loss drug, Wegovy, and named a new CEO. Mondelez International (MDLZ) shares declined when the maker of Oreo Cookies and Ritz Crackers posted a drop in North American sales and said profits will be hurt by the soaring price of cocoa. Oil and gold futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved higher. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Trading in most major cryptocurrencies was higher. TradingView
