Title: Ozempic helped people drink less alcohol, study finds
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-semaglutide-alcohol-consumption-1851761534
Time Published: 2025-02-12T17:47:41Z
Full Content:
A new study is adding to the growing body of evidence that Ozempic (NVO-3.42%) and other GLP-1 medications could help people cut back on drinking alcohol. Some patients taking a low dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, reported reducing their consumption of alcohol, according to a new study published Wednesday in the scientific journal JAMA Psychiatry. It was the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of the effects of semaglutide on alcohol consumption. The small clinical trial followed 48 adults with alcohol use disorder who were not seeking treatment over nine weeks. During the study, researchers gave half the group small weekly doses of semaglutide while the other half received a placebo. After two months, the people taking semaglutide drank almost 30% less, on average, on days they consumed alcohol, compared to an average reduction of roughly 2% among study participants taking the placebo. This new study follows observational studies, as well as anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggest GLP-1 treatments can help users curb addictions. Semaglutide belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. However, the evidence is starting to pile up that this medication could help people with other types of cravings. The mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” the authors of a previous study theorized. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know In addition to a number of studies, a Morgan Stanley (MS-0.15%) survey from last year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro (LLY-0.24%), and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. At the moment, Novo Nordisk is the only pharmaceutical company that is currently studying alcohol consumption in a trial that examines semaglutide’s effect on liver damage. David Ricks, the CEO of Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly, said in December that the company plans to test obesity medications as a treatment for alcohol and drug addiction starting this year.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO): Among the Best International Dividend Stocks to Buy Now
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-nvo-among-best-055118386.html
Time Published: 2025-02-12T05:51:18Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other international dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years. After slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan’s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025. Regionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco’s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%. When it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks. Our Methodology For this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Dividend Yield as of February 11: 1.75% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Founded in 1923, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that provides insulin, obesity medications, and hormone therapies. 2024 was a strong year for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), with sales climbing 25% to $40.6 billion, but the company expects growth to slow in 2025. The stock has dropped 40% since last June, as investors worry about demand for obesity drugs and mixed trial results. Analysts observe that the first half of 2024 was exciting, but things cooled down when US prescription growth slowed and some drug trials underperformed. Political uncertainty, especially with Trump’s election, has also made investors nervous. In 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) raised its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40, which includes an interim dividend of DKK 3.50 distributed in August. This is the 29th consecutive year of dividend growth at NVO. Novo Nordisk is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects capital expenditures of around DKK 65 billion but has no plans for share repurchases. In 2025, Novo Nordisk expects a free cash flow of around DKK 75 to 85 billion and sales growth of 16-24% at constant exchange rates. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds held stakes in Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 67 funds in Q2. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder in the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $1.58 billion. Overall NVO ranks 4th on our list of the best international dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

February 11, 2025 22:31 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV).

(NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "ModivCare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships."

Title: Ozempic and other weight-loss meds may be linked to conditions that could lead to blindness, study says

Popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic (NVO-3.42%) and Zepbound (LLY-0.24%), may have a potential link with several eye conditions that can cause vision loss, according to a new investigatory review published recently in the scientific journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The study focused on nine patients that received prescriptions for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy , or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound. Seven of the patients developed a rare eye condition known as NAION, a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Another patient developed bilateral papillitis — the swelling of both optic nerve heads. And the ninth patient developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy — the loss of blood flow to a part of the retina. The study authors hypothesized that the conditions were a result of rapid changes in blood sugar levels caused by the drugs, “rather than a toxic effect of the drugs.” “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz. “This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes.” The spokesperson added that Novo Nordisk has conducted an analysis across clinical trials of GLP-1 meds, the class of drugs that semaglutide belongs to, looking at NAION diagnoses and has found no evidence of a causal link between the drugs and the eye condition. Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction for the company’s branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Quartz. The study’s lead author, Bradley Katz — an opthlamologist and professor at the University of Utah, told MedicalNewsToday that the researchers are not recommending anyone to stop using the popular medications. “What we are recommending is that if you experience a change in your vision while using one of these drugs, you should consult the prescribing doctor and see an ophthalmologist,” Katz said. This review follows two studies from last year that also found a link between semaglutide and NAION. According to the study from December, diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications. Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study.

February 10, 2025 14:13 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk and certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

February 08, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
