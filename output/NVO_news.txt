Major U.S. equities indexes climbed at midday Friday as regional bank stocks rebounded from yesterday's losses after a flurry of corporate earnings reports. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all higher. Kenvue (KVUE) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as investors bought the dip in the health care product’s stock following yesterday’s selloff after a lawsuit in the U.K. claimed the company’s baby powder caused cancer. Shares of American Express (AXP) gained after the financial firm posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates and lifted its outlook as customers rushed to use its refreshed high-end credit cards. Truist Financial (TFC) also posted better-than-expected results on higher wealth management fees and interest income, sending its shares higher. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners slid as the price of the precious metal, which has been setting records recently, pulled back. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) and shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) were down following comments from President Trump about slashing prices for popular weight-loss drugs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures edged higher. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.

Title: Here's What Trump Said That's Pressuring Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly Stocks

Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares slumped in early trading Friday after President Trump promised to lower the prices of popular weight-loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. In comments to reporters during a White House event Thursday, Trump said prices could drop to $150 a month from $1,300. When asked which treatment he meant, Trump pointed to Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, saying prices for weight-loss drugs like it will be "much lower." Ozempic’s current list price is $1,000 a month, but Novo Nordisk offers it to consumers buying in cash without insurance for less. Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), said the CMS has not yet finished negotiating costs with pharmaceutical firms. Shares of Novo Nordisk were down about 4% in recent trading, while shares of Eli Lilly dropped 3%. President Trump’s recent comments come amid a broader effort by the administration to cut drug prices in the U.S. to align with lower international rates. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Investopedia the company has engaged with the Trump administration, and "will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need." U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost more than a third of their value this year as the company faces growing competition in the weight-loss drug market. Shares of Eli Lilly have added about 3%.
