Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are little changed Tuesday morning after three consecutive sessions of solid gains for major indexes; gold and silver are sustaining their rally, with prices of the precious metals hitting record highs for the second day in a row; a handful of economic indicators are due today, including reports on economic growth and consumer confidence; Novo Nordisk stock is surging after the FDA approved a pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy; and shipmaker Huntington Ingalls Industries stock is surging following news that the Trump administration wants to build new battleships. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a muted open this morning as the market looks to extend a rally that has lifted major indexes back near record highs. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down fractionally in recent trading, after posting gains Monday for the third straight session. The Dow enters Tuesday's session 0.7% away from a new closing high, while the S&P 500 is just 0.3% away from its high. Gold futures hit fresh all-time highs, surging above $4,500 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $58.05 per barrel and were trading at a two-week high. Bitcoin was at $87,800 recently, after briefly rising above $90,000 on Monday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, slipped to 4.15% from 4.17% late yesterday. Precious metals are extending a rally that has sent gold and silver prices to all-time highs. Gold futures were up 1.2% at near $4,520 an ounce recently, while silver futures rose 1.6% to $69.70, with each trading at record levels for the second straight day. Gold and silver have hit a series of record highs this year amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates. A weakening U.S. dollar and geopolitical uncertainty have also contributed to the gains, as investors have sought out assets that are perceived as safe havens. The price of gold has risen 70% year-to-date, while silver has more than doubled. A slew of economic data is set to be released Tuesday, with a mix of reports that were delayed by the government shutdown and more-current numbers. The report on third-quarter gross domestic product, originally due in October, is due at at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the GDP report to show that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2%, down from 3.8% in the second quarter but above the average over the last four years of 2.6%. Also due out Tuesday is the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey for December, which will show how Americans felt about the economy heading into the busy holiday shopping season. Durable goods orders for October, another shutdown-delayed report, and a Federal Reserve report on industrial production in November are also both expected today. Shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) are jumping Tuesday after the Danish drugmaker said it has received Food and Drug Administration approval for an oral version of its popular GLP-1 drug Wegovy. Late Monday, the company said the pill version of Wegovy, which caused patients lose about 16.6% of their body weight on average during a clinical trial, will launch in January in the U.S. The weight loss drug industry has seen Novo rival Eli Lilly (LLY) take the lead in sales growth with its Mounjaro and Zepbound, which proved to be more effective in causing weight loss. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have each been racing to get pill versions of the drugs approved, as the companies believe a wider range of people would be open to taking a pill than getting injections. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares were up 8% in recent premarket trading, while Eli Lilly was down 1%. Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) stock is rising ahead of the opening bell after the Trump administration said that it wants to build new battleships. Navy Secretary John Phelan said Friday that the new ship will be based on a previous Huntington Ingalls design, and that the first ships are expected to be completed by 2028. The company said Friday that it has been given the contract to design and manufacture the new ship. President Trump said Monday that the first ship will be called the USS Defiant as part of his effort to revamp the Navy's fleet of ships into a so-called "Golden Fleet," The Wall Street Journal reported. Huntington Ingalls shares were up 4% in premarket trading, following gains of 5% on Monday and 4% on Friday, each day ending at a record high.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Wegovy® pill approved in the US as first oral GLP-1 for weight management

December 22, 2025 17:50 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*. The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. About the OASIS trial programmeOASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities. About Wegovy® Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition. Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities. Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.
