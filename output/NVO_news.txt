Title: Weight loss drugs are squeezing the food industry

The revolutionary GLP-1 class of weight loss drugs are racking up blockbuster sales at a pace rarely seen in the pharmaceutical industry. But the pharma industry’s gain is the food industry’s loss. Approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration just four years ago, Ozempic, Wegovy and other drugs in this category are now the best-selling medications in the United States. One in eight U.S. adults, some 30 million people, are taking the drugs, according to a new KFF poll. In survey after survey, users of the new weight loss drugs say they are cutting back on purchases of high-calorie foods and dining out less. As a result, Morgan Stanley (MS) predicts that overall consumption of soft drinks, baked goods, and salty snacks will fall 3% by 2035. One study that sent shudders through the food industry was an examination by researchers at Cornell University of purchases of 150,000 households. The study found that if one person was taking a GLP-1 drug, the household reduced its grocery spending by 5.5% within six months. Higher-income households reduced spending by 8.6%. The study by Cornell’s SC Johnson College of Business noted that the reductions were driven by large decreases in purchases of calorie-dense processed food, including an 11% decline in savory snacks. “Our findings highlight the potential for GLP-1 medications to significantly change food demand, a trend with increasingly important implications for the food industry as GLP-1 adoption continues to grow,” the researchers wrote. The changes are likely to last. In a recent survey of 1,700 consumers by the consulting firm Ey-Parthenon, respondents taking weight loss drugs said their consumption of snack foods dropped between 40% and 60%, while specialty and health food consumption climbed by almost 50%. “The survey results indicate that adoption (of GLP-1 drugs) will be rapid and long-lasting,” Ey said in its report. Restaurants may take a hit as well, according to a survey by the website Finance Buzz. More than half of those queried who were taking a GLP-1 drug said they spent less money on dining out since starting the medications, and 37% reported reduced spending on alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, also known by the generic name semaglutide, were approved for the treatment of diabetes some 20 years ago, but the category took off when it was discovered that they are extremely effective for weight loss, and with minimal side effects. The drugs mimic the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate appetite, and can reduce calorie intake by 20% to 30% daily. Given that some 40% of U.S. adults classify as obese, the potential market is huge. Plus, the drugs may be effective against a broad range of diseases. Scientists are studying them for the treatment of heart disease, addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, symptoms of menopause, sleep apnea, and fatty liver disease. Sales are widely projected to soar from $15.87 billion in 2023 to anywhere from $100 billion to $150 billion by 2030. The drugs are costly however, running $1,000 a month and up in the U.S., and are often not covered by insurance, which limits their uptake. But prices are likely to drop as pharma companies develop oral versions of the drugs. That prospect already had food companies running scared more than a year ago. The CEO of Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said last year that food company executives were so “scared” they were calling him for advice on how to adapt to the new world of weight loss drugs. According to its recent survey of 300 patients taking GLP-1 drugs, Morgan Stanley said that “two-thirds of patients reported eating three or more snacks per day before starting the drugs, while 74% reported eating two snacks or less after starting the drugs.” There may, however, be an upside for those food companies that offer lower-calorie options. An October 2024 survey by PwC of some 3,000 U.S. adults found that, while GLP-1 users spent about 11% less on most categories of food, 56% said they were making healthier food choices. Shane Smith, CEO of packaged meats company Smithfield Foods, told a consumer conference in March that there is growing demand for meat among consumers who are taking weight-loss drugs. Based on scanner data, it is “snacks and sugary drinks and those types of things that they’re not buying,” Smith said. “But they’re really focused on maintaining a good level of protein and high-quality protein in their diet,” Smith said. “So, we think we’re set up well as we go forward.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump's push for lower drug prices is just asking Big Pharma to make less money

Pharma stocks rebounded and rose into the green Monday afternoon after details of President Donald Trump’s executive order on drug prices became public. The order does not include a legal mandate that pharmaceutical companies lower prices in the U.S., The New York Times (NYT+0.23%) reports. Instead, it asks pharma firms to voluntarily lower their prices. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were up 2.4% Monday afternoon, after being down 2% earlier in the day. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) stock had climbed 2% by midday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) stock gained 0.2%, and Novartis (NVS-0.56%) stock was about even on the day. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was up 3.1% and Merck (MRK-0.30%) gained 5.2%. Pharma stocks had fallen earlier Monday before the details of the executive order became known. The executive order said the Trump administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other nations if drugmakers don’t lower prices voluntarily, according to The Times. The order also called on federal agencies to look into why European countries get lower prices, and to attempt to get them to pay more. “I’m not knocking the drug companies,” Trump said before signing the order Monday. “I’m really more knocking the countries than the drug companies.” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social late Sunday that the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy.” He followed that up with a post Monday saying drug prices would fall by 59%, though he did not specify how he arrived at that number. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a similar measure in his first term that would have applied to about 50 popular drugs covered by Medicare. The plan was blocked by a federal court that ruled the administration had taken shortcuts in the policymaking process.

Title: Eli Lilly stock sinks as pharma gets left out of the market rally

Pharma companies were mostly left out of the stock market’s broader rally Monday morning on the news that President Donald Trump would sign an order lowering some drug prices. A surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China on Monday morning sent stocks soaring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all up 2.5% or more in the first 30 minutes of trading. But pharmaceutical stocks weren’t invited to the party, after Trump said Sunday night that he would sign an executive order lowering drug prices in the United States. Trump signed the order Monday morning. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were down 2% Monday morning, even after a new study found the company’s weight loss drug, Zepbound, beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a head-to-head trial. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) was down 1.9% Monday morning. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) was down 0.4%, while Novartis (NVS-0.56%) was down 0.5%. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was a rare pharma bright spot, up 2.2%. “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!” Trump posted to his Truth Social app on Sunday night. The president wrote that under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy,” the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price. He said he would sign the executive order on Monday. Trump followed that up with a post Monday morning claiming that drug prices would be reduced by 59%, though he didn’t specify how he arrived at that number. Americans often pay much higher prices for drugs than people in other nations. A committee found last year that the net cost of Ozempic, for example, was $600 per month in the U.S., compared to $92 in the U.K. and $59 in Germany.

Title: Eli Lilly's Zepbound beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a big weight loss drug study

Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.74%) and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.61%) weight loss drugs went head-to-head in a weight loss study for the first time — and Eli Lilly’s drug came out on top. Participants who took Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which is sold as Zepbound, lost 50 pounds on average, while those using Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, lost an average of 33 pounds. The study was funded by Eli Lilly and published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial included 751 participants, all Americans who were considered overweight or obese and had at least one other weight-related health issue. They received weekly injections of the highest tolerated dose of either drug. The participants who took Zepbound lost an average of about 20% of their body weight at the end of the 72-week trial, while those who took Wegovy lost about 14% of theirs. About 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy. “These data confirm Zepbound as a leading treatment option for people living with obesity and equip healthcare providers with critical insights to make well-informed treatment decisions as part of a comprehensive obesity care plan,” Leonard Glass, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president of global medical affairs, said in a statement. Eli Lilly stock fell about 1% in Monday morning trading, after President Donald Trump signaled plans Sunday for an executive order aimed at lower prescription drug prices. Novo Nordisk stock was down about 0.4%. Participants in both groups had improvements in health factors like blood pressure, blood fat, and blood sugar levels as they lost weight. Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly had released top-line results of the study back in December, before they were peer-reviewed. This was the first time the study was published in full. The rise of GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, has been a major boost for Lilly and Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, making them the most valuable pharma companies in the world. A number of cheaper, compounded versions have also made it to market, though the FDA has begun cracking down on them since the drugs are no longer considered to be in shortage. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: Christy Anderson Picks Palantir And Wins 2024-2025 Derby

A 446% gain in Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) propelled Christy Anderson to a victory in the 2024-2025 running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby, an annual stock-picking contest. Anderson, a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, is chief operating officer for a small company that makes radio frequency amplifiers with military applications. As such, she became familiar with Palantir, an analytical software company whose Gotham platform is used by the U.S. military and Western-allied nations. Her company doesn’t do business with Palantir, and she doesn’t own the stock. In fact, Anderson doesn’t own any stocks. “The stock market to me is just gambling,” she says. “I’m very intrigued by it though. I look at stocks every day.” Anderson also picked Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), a Danish pharmaceutical company, and Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE), which mines digital currencies. Both suffered losses, but her gain on Palantir was so huge that she ended with a 121% combined return, easily capturing first place. Palantir is “probably overpriced now,” Anderson says. “They don’t really have the revenue to justify their market price.” When she entered the contest, she wrote that ”the number of military hotspots continues to grow,” and that the military “will need an increasing number of unmanned assets.” Anderson expects that the stock market will be volatile in the coming year, and will be little changed a year from now, after a lot of ups and downs. Donny Sanders, an accountant in Worcester, Massachusetts, took second place with an 82% gain. All three of his selections rose, led by Strategy (MSTR) with a 149% advance. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) chipped in a 58% gain, while iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) gained 39%. Of the three stocks, Sanders actually holds only one, Tesla. He doesn’t own a Tesla car, but “might get one eventually,” he says. He regards the car as “a super piece of technology.” Sanders doesn’t have a strong guess as to what the market will do in the coming year. “Hold for the long term, that’s my motto,” he says. Ronald Robinson, a retiree in Pahrump, Nevada, took third place with a 48% combined gain on his three choices. Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) led the way, with a 107% gain. Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) returned 25% and Energy Transfer LP (ET) 11%. Robinson formerly worked for a transportation company in Alaska. He invests in stocks “just for kind of fun,” he says. Robinson is optimistic about the market for the coming year. Lately, he says, the market has been “based on negative news. If the negative news can simmer down, I think the market will be good.” He thinks the U.S. and China will probably reach “some kind of agreement” on trade. Of 34 contestants, three saw all three of their picks go up. They were Sanders, Robinson, and Larry Weiner, a real estate agent in Las Vegas. Eighteen contestants notched positive returns, and 16 showed a loss. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index was up 6.8% for the contest period. You are welcome to enter the next running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby. This will be the 18th stock-picking contest I have run, and the ninth in which contestants have to pick three stocks, not just one. To enter, send me: Email me your entry at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110. Entries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2025. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2026. If you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are important. You do not need to own the stocks you select, but it’s fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are permitted. There’s no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients.
