SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Off-brand weight-loss drug makers are suing the FDA, again
URL: https://qz.com/ofa-fda-compounded-semaglutide-lawsuit-1851766464
Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:43:12Z
Full Content:
A group that represents pharmacies that have been producing off-brand versions of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs just filed another lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This time, it’s over the health regulator’s decision to remove semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.68%) popular Ozempic and Wegovy treatments — from its drug shortage list. Semaglutide has been on the agency’s shortage list since March 2022. During this time, pharmacies, telehealth companies, and other healthcare providers have been able to make and sell what are known as compounded versions of the drug. In its lawsuit, the Outsourcing Facility Association (OFA) claims that the agency is “dismissing evidence that the shortage persists” and that its decision will “deprive patients of a vital treatment.” Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.23%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price have made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Due to branded drug shortages, companies have been able to sell off-brand versions. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The FDA also said on Friday that it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide in the next 60 to 90 days. This is the second lawsuit the OFA has filed against the FDA over compounded weight-loss drugs. Last October, the group sued the agency over its decision to remove tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound — from its shortage list, making arguments similar to those in its latest lawsuit. The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision. Then, in a letter from December, the agency stated that its review found that Eli Lilly had sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. This case is still ongoing. However, not all compounders are looking to challenge the FDA on this. “Compounding pharmacists have long known that this shortage had a shelf life,” said Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, in a statement. Brunner also thanked the FDA for providing compounders with an “off-ramp” to stop production — something the agency didn’t initially offer with its tirzepatide decision. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Hims & Hers can't sell off-brand Ozempic forever, but it can still sell these weight-loss meds

Time Published: 2025-02-25T19:15:00Z

Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.76%) made a killing last year selling an off-brand version of Ozempic, but with the drug’s shortage now over, the company will soon have to halt sales of its cheaper alternative. That said, the millennial-focused telehealth company still has a few options on the table. Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.68%) Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. Hims & Hers could sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available. Now that the shortage is over, Hims & Hers will likely have to stop selling compounded semaglutide. The FDA updated its drug shortage list on Friday, marking the branded versions of semaglutide as fully available. The agency also said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide in the next 60 to 90 days. Hims & Hers said it will stop offering these essential copies of semaglutide this year. “We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday evening. Still, the company expects its weight-loss business to generate at least $725 million in 2025. Here are the weight-loss treatments Hims & Hers can still legally sell: The company already offers monthly subscription for popular GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppress appetite. Dudum also told investors that the company is open to a partnership like the one its rival Ro has with Eli Lilly, which lets Ro offer its members cheaper Zepbound in vials rather than the standard auto-injector pens. However, he added, that there is still issues with the limited supply for branded weight-loss drugs. “We still really can’t actually source the branded medications from our pharmacies for our own platform,” Dudum said. He said this prevents the company for having a “durable offering” of branded weight-loss drugs at scale. Hims & Hers also currently offers what it calls “oral medication kits” made up of medication and supplements that can aid in weight loss including bupropion, metformin, topiramate, vitamin B12, and naltrexone. The company will continue to offer personalized prescriptions of compounded semaglutide. Under the law, these prescriptions will need to be significantly different from branded medication on the market — differences can include personalized dosing or alternative administration methods. In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. On Monday’s call, Hims & Hers CFO Oluyemi Okupe said that personalized semaglutide dosages will supplement the company’s core offerings. The company announced in November that it plans to offer customers a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight loss drug, this year. Liraglutide, is taken daily instead of weekly like newer options, and is currently sold under the brand name Saxenda by Novo Nordisk. Many of its patents have already expired. In a 56-week-long clinical trial, the once-daily injection helped most patients lose over 5% of their weight. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.23%) weekly-injectable Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. Dudum said the company plans to launch its liraglutide offering by midyear or early in the second half of the year.

(NASDAQ:CDLX), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX) Class Period: March 14, 2024 - August 7, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) increasing consumer engagement led to an increase in consumer incentives; (2) Cardlytics could not increase its billings commensurate with the increased consumer engagement; (3) as a result, there was a significant risk that its revenue growth would slow or decline; (4) the changes to Cardlytics’ Ads Decision Engine (“ADE”), which led to increased consumer engagement, led to the “underdelivery” of budgets and customers billing estimates; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Cardlytics’ business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

February 24, 2025 17:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors who claim they were misled about the future of its experimental obesity treatment, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys.

Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, alleges that the company and its key executives committed securities violations during the Phase 3 trial of CagriSema, known as REDEFINE-1. Investors who acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022, and December 19, 2024, allege that the firm painted an overly optimistic picture of CagriSema’s potential for achieving significant weight loss of at least 25%. According to the plaintiffs, Novo Nordisk relied on questionable data while glossing over issues with dosage tolerability. Central to the lawsuit is the claim that the company’s “optimistic forecasts” about CagriSema’s effectiveness were unfounded. The suit also contends that the study’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, compromised the trial's ability to assess weight loss at the tested dosage accurately. This, the plaintiffs suggest, implies either unexpected tolerability issues that led patients to reduce their doses or a rushed patient selection process that included those not targeting the 25% weight loss goal. The complaint points to Novo Nordisk’s December 20, 2024, announcement of REDEFINE-1's preliminary results. The disclosure indicated that the trial used a flexible dosing protocol and revealed that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of CagriSema patients were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the comparator drugs. Following the announcement, Novo Nordisk's stock price plunged nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue that this drop highlights the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Hagens Berman is investigating investors’ claims. “We are thoroughly investigating these allegations to determine whether Novo Nordisk intentionally misrepresented trial details and masked significant issues with the drug's tolerability,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
