Novo Nordisk (NVO) released mixed clinical-trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Friday, leaving Wall Street disappointed. The pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, said its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug CagriSema fell short of expectations. The drug did not achieve the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by the company and analysts. Instead, patients in the phase 3 clinical trial lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s current weight-loss drug on the market, resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk stock fell over 20% on Friday morning following the news. CagriSema belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, which was made popular by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. That’s why several pharma companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss meds. Novo Nordisk was betting that by mimicking multiple hormones, it could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. Still, the trial did deliver some promising results. Novo Nordisk reported that 40.4% of patients taking CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 25% or more over the 68-week trial period. The company is expected to reveal results of a second phase 3 trial of the drug in the first half of 2025. Eli Lilly and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which are also developing next-gen weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 5% and 3%, respectively, on Friday.

Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock is tumbling 21% today after individuals who received the company's experimental weight-loss drug shed many fewer pounds than expected. Specifically, the weight of patients who received Novo's anti-obesity drug, CagriSema, declined by an average of 20.4% in 68 weeks, versus the 25% average weight loss that Novo had expected the treatment to produce. A closeup shot of a laboratory technician handling a medical device used for fertility treatments. The company, however, stated that if all the patients who were tested had complied 100% with the treatment requirements, their mean weight loss would have been 22.7% and 40% of the trial participants would have shed at least 25% of their weight. Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures sell-off as government shutdown looms, inflation data improves but still sticky

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pointed to another rough day on Wall Street Friday after the House of Representatives voted against a Trump-backed spending bill, further increasing the odds of a US government shutdown this weekend. Investors also digested key inflation data that showed a deceleration in price increases during the month of November after the Federal Reserve lowered the number of cuts it expects next year. Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: CagriSema demonstrates superior weight loss in adults with obesity or overweight in the REDEFINE 1 trial

December 20, 2024 05:41 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from REDEFINE 1, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 1 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to the individual components cagrilintide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once-weekly. The trial included 3,417 randomised people with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and a mean baseline body weight of 106.9 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks compared to a reduction of 11.8% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.1% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.3% with placebo alone. In addition, 40.4% of patients who received CagriSema reached a weight loss of 25% or more after 68 weeks, compared to 6.0% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 0.9% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 20.4% compared to a reduction of 11.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 14.9% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.0% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.” The results from the second pivotal phase 3 trial, REDEFINE 2, in adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight are expected during the first half of 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby help people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. Additional phase 3 trials are ongoing. REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,400 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – a 72-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

Title: Weight loss drugs are getting people to the doctor. Now comes the wave of long-ignored diagnoses

Popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are boosting the use of healthcare in the U.S., leading to an uptick in patients getting diagnosed and starting prescriptions for other conditions, according to a new analysis by health data firm Truveta. The firm analyzed thousands of electronic patient records between 2020 and 2024 and found a noticeable bump in first-time diagnoses of sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes just days after a patient started a prescription for a GLP-1 weight-loss drug. These drugs are bringing people who previously avoided medical care into the doctor’s office. In partnership with Truveta, Reuters interviewed a number of patients and physicians who said that some overweight patients seeking GLP-1s treatments have been hesitant to visit a doctor or go in for routine tests for years due to “stigma and bias they often encounter.” Because of this, once they do finally go to a doctor seeking a GLP-1 prescription these patients also end up getting diagnosed with other obesity-related conditions. Truveta researchers found that for every 1,000 patients with a first-time GLP-1 prescription in 2024, 42 ended up getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within 15 days, compared with 32 in 2020. During the same period, the number of sleep apnea diagnoses per 1,000 patients rose to 11 from 8, while the number of cardiovascular disease diagnoses jumped to 15 from 13. Even a medical device maker attributed their revenue growth this year in part to the rise of GLP-1 drugs. ResMed (RMD), a seller sleep of apnea devices, said its revenue rose 11% during its fiscal year ending in June. The company’s CEO, Michael Farrell, told investors in a recent meeting that GLP-1 drugs are “bringing people into primary care like never before.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) diabetes drug Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Popular brands on the market also include Ozempic’s sister drug Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these meds has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world.
