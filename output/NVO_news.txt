Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Monday, a day before a Senate hearing on the costs of the company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

Title: Novo Nordisk Sinks on Obesity Drug Study's Disappointing Results

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Friday after a study of the pharmaceutical firm’s latest obesity treatment showed less effectiveness in higher doses. The company said a Phase 2a trial of the drug monlunabant found patients with a baseline weight of 110.1 kilograms (242.7 pounds) taking 10 milligrams once a day for 16 weeks achieved a drop of 7.1 kilograms (15.7 pounds), versus 0.7 kilograms (1.5 pounds) for those given a placebo. Increasing the dosage, however, produced “limited additional weight loss.” Novo Nordisk also said that mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, “were more frequent and dose dependent" when compared to placebos. Novo Nordisk said it would be initiating a larger Phase 2b study next year “to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant.” The company is a leader in the weight-loss medicine category, with the booming popularity of its Wegovy and Ozempic injectables. However, it has received criticism over the high price of the drugs, and a Novo Nordisk executive reportedly said earlier this week that Ozempic is “very likely” to be targeted by the U.S. government for a price cut for Medicare recipients. Novo Nordisk shares were down over 5% in intraday trading Friday, though even with Friday's losses, they've gained more than 22% since the start of the year.

Title: Novo Nordisk stock tumbled over the latest results for its experimental weight loss pill

Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced mixed results today for a phase 2 trial of an experimental weight loss pill that works differently than its already-popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 6% during Friday morning trading after it posted the results. The Danish pharma giant tested monlunabant, a drug it acquired in 2023 with its $1 billion purchase of Inversago Pharma, in a phase 2 trial involving 243 participants with obesity and other related health complications. Monlunabant works by blocking CB1 receptors, which are found in the brain and nervous system and have an effect on appetite. Conversely, Wegovy works by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and reduces appetite. The new drug was tested in once-daily doses of 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg. Starting from an average weight of 110.1 kg (242.7 lbs), participants taking any dose of monlunabant lost significantly more weight than those on a placebo. After 16 weeks, people taking a daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant lost an average of 7.1 kg (15.6 lbs), or about 6% of their weight, while the placebo group only lost about 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Higher doses didn’t result in much more weight loss beyond that. In the trial, the most common side effects were digestive issues, which were generally mild to moderate and depended on the dose. People taking monlunabant also reported more mild-to-moderate mood-related side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep problems, compared to those on a placebo. However, Novo Nordisk reported no severe neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Novo Nordisk said it is plans to start a larger phase 2 trial of the drug in 2025.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Monlunabant phase 2a trial in obesity successfully completed

September 20, 2024 08:43 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 September 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from a phase 2a clinical trial with monlunabant, a small molecule oral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) inverse agonist. Monlunabant, formerly INV-202, was part of the acquisition of Inversago Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced in August 2023 [Link]. The trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of monlunabant compared to placebo on body weight after 16 weeks in 243 people with obesity and metabolic syndrome1. People were equally randomised among the four treatment arms. From a baseline body weight of 110.1 kg, all doses of monlunabant achieved a statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. After 16 weeks of treatment, people treated with a once-daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant achieved a weight loss of 7.1 kg compared to a reduction of 0.7 kg with placebo2. Limited additional weight loss was seen at higher doses of monlunabant. In the trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being mild to moderate and dose dependent. Reporting of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, was more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported in relation to neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a larger phase 2b trial in obesity to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant over a longer duration in a global population. The phase 2b trial is expected to be initiated in 2025. About monlunabant and CB1Monlunabant is an inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor which plays an important role in metabolism and appetite regulation in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, pancreas, muscles and lungs.
