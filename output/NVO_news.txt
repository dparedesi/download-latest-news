NEW YORK, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

February 17, 2025 16:34 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: These 4 Big Cap Health Care Stocks Just Hit New 52-Week Lows

Healthcare stocks, new lows The health care sector is likely reacting to the uncertainty created by the effect of cuts to the federal budget now being implemented by one of three government branches: the executive aka the White House. The potential loss of Medicaid, for example, would have a huge impact on pharmaceuticals and related industries. And that’s just one example. With the Senate voting to make the anti-vaccine proponent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services in President Donald Trump’s cabinet, questions about his guidance in that area trouble analysts who cover stocks affected. Investors in these four healthcare stocks haven’t been waiting to see what develops: they’ve been selling. So much unloading has taken place recently that a number of well-known names already have dropped to new 52-week lows. It’s a dramatic difference from the recent popularity of tech and social media stocks. Other factors enter into the new lows, of course, but with that overriding issue, it’s a problem for the sector as a whole. Hologic (NASD: HOLX) Hologic daily price chart, 2 17 25. The red circled spot on these price charts indicates the spot where the stock’s 50-day moving average crossed below its 200-day moving average and a downtrend ensued. The medical instruments and supply company specializes in women’s health issues and features a “women’s health index” on the company website. Market cap is $14.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 20. The stock trades at 2.99 book value and the debt-t0-equity ratio is a relatively low (for the sector) 53. The healthcare research investment firm Leerink Partners on February 6 downgraded their opinion of Hologic from “outperform” to “market perform” with a price target of $75. Merck (NYSE: MRK) Merck daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer has a market cap of $209.99 billion. Merck is one of the 30 Dow Jones Industrials and it’s a component of the S&P 500. The price-earnings ratio is 12.33. This year’s earnings are up by 17% and up over the past five years by 12%. The company pays a dividend of 3.92%. On February 10, TD Cowen downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold” with a price target of $100. Moderna (NASD: MRNA) Moderna daily price chart, 2 17 15. This biotech company has a market cap of $12.70 billion. There is no price-earnings ratio as this year’s “earnings” are down by 4.50% and down over the past five years by 42.94%. Moderna trades at just 1.06 times book. The short float on the stock is a relatively high 11.83% which demonstrates definite interest by those who sell short. The company does not pay a dividend. Goldman on January 29 downgraded Moderna from “buy” to “neutral” with a price target of $51. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) Novo Nordisk daily price chart, 2 17 25. The drug manufacturer, based in Denmark, has a market cap of $262 billion. Some analysts believe the stock may be suffering from negative reaction to a Super Bowl ad for their product “Him and Hers.” The price-earnings ratio is 23 and the price-to-free cash flow is 24. The next dividend, with an ex-date of March 31, will pay a 2.45% dividend. The short float is a low .40, indicating lack of interest among Wall Street’s short selling crowd.
