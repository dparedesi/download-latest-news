[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Novo Nordisk (NVO-9.55%), the maker of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, expects at least some short-term impacts from President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. “We still have products moving across borders like most global companies,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Bloomberg on Thursday. “Of course there’ll be some short-term impact as we mitigate the impact of tariffs.” The Denmark-based company’s stock fell nearly 3% Thursday morning following his comments. Jorgensen noted that even when drugmakers manufacture in the U.S., they typically rely on ingredients sourced abroad. He emphasized that generic drugs would be hit the hardest, potentially causing shortages and driving up prices in general. Since taking office, Trump has proposed several tariffs. He announced last month plans to impose tariffs “in the neighborhood of 25%” on imported vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals starting in April. Meanwhile, 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, and duties on Chinese goods were raised by 10%. Trump also suggested that tariffs on imported goods from the European Union are “coming very soon.” And he recently signed a memorandum that directs his advisers to draft new “fair and reciprocal” trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners. Jorgensen’s comments also come as Trump has pushed pharma companies to bring more production to the U.S. as part of his broader effort to boost domestic manufacturing. In February, Trump met with top industry executives, including Eli Lilly (LLY-4.32%) CEO David Ricks. A week later, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new U.S. manufacturing facilities. Pfizer (PFE-0.54%) CEO Albert Bourla also said this week that the drugmaker could move some of its overseas manufacturing to its U.S. plants, if necessary. Novo Nordisk announced last year that it is investing $4.1 billion to build a new facility in Clayton, North Carolina.
