Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.31%), the maker of blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, has entered an agreement with Denmark-based Ascendis Pharma (ASND+1.76%) to leverage the latter’s advanced drug delivery technology. The partnership aims to speed up the development of a long-acting, monthly GLP-1 drug. Current GLP-1 medications on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. “Developing potential therapies that can be administered less frequently could benefit societies as well as individual patients, and it is a clear focus area for Novo Nordisk,” Brian Vandahl, senior vice president of global research technologies at Novo Nordisk, said in a press release. “We look forward to working with Ascendis to explore the potential of the TransCon technology platform to reduce the dosing frequency of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other treatments for cardiometabolic diseases.” GLP-1 treatments are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications has transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.01%), the producer of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Viking Therapeutics is also developing a monthly GLP-1 weight-loss drug. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Under the deal, Novo Nordisk has secured the exclusive worldwide license to use Ascendis’ TransCon technology platform to develop, produce, and sell products for metabolic diseases, including obesity and Type 2 diabetes with the primary goal being to develop a monthly GLP-1. Ascendis could receive up to $285 million in total payments for this leading drug program, covering upfront fees, development, and regulatory milestones. The company will also be eligible for sales-based milestone payments and royalties on global net sales. For each additional product candidate targeting metabolic or cardiovascular diseases, Ascendis could earn up to $77.5 million. Ascendis will handle the initial development of TransCon-based product candidates, with Novo Nordisk covering these early development costs. Novo Nordisk will also take charge of clinical development, regulatory approvals, large-scale manufacturing, and commercialization.

Title: A new weight loss pill outperformed Novo Nordisk's version

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+2.28%) released new clinical trial data on Sunday for its experimental weight-loss drugs, which include a highly anticipated oral pill. The San Diego-based company’s stock surged over 6% during pre-market trading on Monday. It has since fallen about 5% from its closing price on Friday. This marks the latest development in the competitive race among pharmaceutical companies to introduce new weight-loss drug alternatives to current market leaders like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. Viking Therapeutics shared on Sunday the latest data of its two clinical trials testing an injection and pill versions of its experimental weight-loss treatment VK2735 at the industry conference Obesity Week in San Antonio, Texas. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The company reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh noted on Monday that Viking’s results surpassed Wall Street expectations and outperformed those of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.31%) experimental weight-loss pill, amycretin. “Notably, the 100 mg dose appears to be outpacing the 100 mg dose of amycretin, which achieved about a 5% placebo-adjusted weight loss in four weeks,” Hsieh wrote. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 2% on Monday morning. In a phase 2 trial of the same drug administered as a weekly injection, patients experienced an average weight loss of 14.7% over 13 weeks. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.01%) Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. U.K.-based pharma giant AstraZeneca (AZN-7.25%) also shared new details about its weight-loss drug pipeline at the conference on Monday. In an early-stage clinical trial, patients taking the company’s pill lost an average of 5.8% of their body weight over four weeks. The pill, which it licensed last year from the Chinese biotech Eccogene, was deemed safe and tolerable and will advance to phase 2 clinical trials. AstraZeneca is also developing two additional obesity drugs: one targeting the hormone amylin and a GLP-1 injectable. After the launch of the diabetes medication Ozempic in 2017, the demand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed in recent years. Fervent demand for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic over the last year had the company racing to keep up with supply. The Denmark-based company’s revenue even buoyed the nation’s GDP in 2023. Several pharmaceutical companies are now chasing the hype, working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, Pfizer, and Zealand Pharma are all developing weight-loss drugs. Unsatisfied with their own success, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also developing even more powerful weight-loss drugs. The majority of these companies are also working to introduce weight-loss pills. Weight-loss drugs that already on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. But a pill could help with current supply constraints and open the market to patients hesitant to taking injections.

Title: Markets brace for presidential election, Fed meeting: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Election Day is almost here. The looming question remains how a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory will shape the market narrative for the rest of the year and beyond. Investors should soon learn the answer, with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday. In the week before the election, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1.37% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5% despite hitting its first record close since June during the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just over 0.1%. It's not the only big event of the week. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision, with markets largely anticipating that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Earnings season rolls on with a week headlined by reports from Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Moderna (MRNA). One of the top potentially market-moving events that strategists have discussed throughout the year has finally arrived with the 2024 presidential election slated for Tuesday, Nov. 5. But it's been an abnormal election year for markets. When analyzing the S&P 500's average intraday trading range, Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick found that this past October was the second-least volatile month leading into an election in the past 50 years. Zooming out further, research from Bespoke Investment Group shows the S&P 500 had its best start to an election year since 1932, with a 20% year-to-date return for the benchmark index through the end of October. Still, Election Day itself is considered a risk event for markets. Speculation has built that a "Trump Trade" has been forming in markets as the betting odds of the former president winning the election have risen. But some market strategists aren't convinced there's a clear read on what outcome investors will be rooting for come Tuesday. "I think the market would do fine with Harris," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "I think the market would do fine with Trump. I don't think the stock market is really pricing any presidential odds." Franklin Templeton chief markets strategist Stephen Dover told Yahoo Finance that the key for markets could simply be getting past the event itself. "Just having those elections settled, whichever way it goes, would be positive," Dover said. Baird market strategist Michael Antonelli agreed, telling Yahoo Finance that the riskiest scenario from the election is "one where we just don't know the winner." Markets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its next policy decision on Nov. 7. The key question entering the meeting is what the Federal Reserve will (or won't) signal about its plans for future meetings. Given that data has continued to show an economy pacing for solid growth while inflation's path down to the Fed's 2% goal remains bumpy, markets have moved to price in fewer interest rate cuts over the next year than initially thought when the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. As of Friday, markets see about three less rate cuts through the end of next year than previously thought. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Morgan Stanley chief global economist Seth Carpenter doesn't think markets will get much more clarity on the Fed's path in the coming week. "The strength in growth gives the Fed patience as it allows policy easing to be gradual," Carpenter wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Neither inflation nor unemployment is forcing the Fed's hand. We do not expect Powell to give specific guidance on the size or cadence of future cuts. Policy remains data-dependent, and neither the September 50 [basis point] cut nor the November 25 [basis point] cut indicates the future pace." The market's debate over how much easing the Fed will enact over the next year has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soaring since the last Fed meeting in September. The 10-year added about 7 basis points on Friday to close near 4.36%, its highest level since early July. Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield told Yahoo Finance that the move in rates, and the overall focus on the economic data driving them higher, is overshadowing what's shaping up to be another solid quarter of corporate results. With 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 5.1%. This would mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth as the index continues to rebound from the earnings recession seen in 2023. "We went through a two-year period where earnings were flat," Mayfield said. "They were volatile. Now we have earnings on the rise again. They're beating analyst expectations at a pretty solid clip. Profit margins are expanding. So the big picture is things look pretty good." And that story appears to be staying intact for the fourth quarter too. Since the period began at the start of October, analysts have cut estimates by 1.8%, according to FactSet data. This is in line with the average cut to earnings seen over the past 10 years. "At a certain point, earnings have to take the baton," Mayfield said. "I think we're in a good position for earnings to do that."

After a whirlwind week of tech earnings, it’s time to take a deep breath and fasten your seat belts again for another big ride. This week is expected to be intense, high-stakes, and perhaps exhausting as Americans head to the polls to decide the country’s 47th president. Election Day falls on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Hopefully, by the end of the week, the world will know who will lead the nation — Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Current polls show an incredibly close race, suggesting a tight contest that could bring volatility to markets and emotions alike. The historic event will likely impact market sentiment, and investors will need to stay tuned to stock market movements and macroeconomic indicators. Election outcomes can significantly affect the market’s direction, shaping policies that impact industries, fiscal policy, and international relations.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrates superior improvement in both liver fibrosis and MASH resolution in the ESSENCE trial

November 01, 2024 08:13 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 1 November 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from part 1 of the ongoing ESSENCE trial, a pivotal phase 3, 240-week, double-blinded trial in 1,200 adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3)1. Part 1 of the ESSENCE trial evaluated the effect of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg on liver tissue (histology) compared to placebo on top of standard of care for the first 800 randomised people at 72 weeks. The trial achieved its primary endpoints by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, as well as resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. At week 72, 37.0% of people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis compared to 22.5% on placebo2. 62.9% of people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved resolution of steatohepatitis3 with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to 34.1% on placebo2. In the trial, semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous semaglutide 2.4 mg trials. “We are very pleased about the ESSENCE clinical trial results and the potential of semaglutide to help people living with MASH” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Among people with overweight or obesity, one in three live with MASH. This has a serious impact on their health and represents a significant unmet need.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approvals in the US and EU in the first half of 2025. The detailed results from ESSENCE will be presented at a scientific conference in 2024. Part 2 of the ESSENCE trial will continue with expected readout in 2029. About MASHMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. Of those who are currently overweight or living with obesity, more than one in three are also living with MASH. People living with MASH often experience few or no specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which often results in delayed diagnosis. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver cancer, is higher in people living with MASH than in the general population. About the ESSENCE trialESSENCE is a phase 3 trial evaluating the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). ESSENCE is a two-part trial where 1,200 planned participants were randomised 2:1 to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, on top of standard of care for 240 weeks. In part 1, the objective was to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improves liver histology at 72 weeks based on biopsy sampling from the first 800 randomised patients. In part 2, the objective is to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg lowers the risk of liver-related clinical events compared to placebo in adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis at 240 weeks. About semaglutide 2.4 mg Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity), adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity). In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.
