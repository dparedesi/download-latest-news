Eli Lilly (LLY-1.16%) CEO David Ricks said the sale of cheaper, off-brand versions of the company’s blockbuster weight loss drug isn’t having a “financial impact” on the pharma giant. Ricks was referring to a practice in the industry known as compounding. When a medication is in shortage, which Eli Lilly’s Zepbound has been for most of the year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows pharmacies to make compounded, or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight loss drugs during recent shortages. “I wouldn’t characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn’t one for us,” Ricks told investors during a call on Wednesday after the company posted its third-quarter earnings report. “I think as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates us backdoor generic world.” Eli Lilly’s top leader on weight loss drugs, Patrik Jonsson, noted that these off-brand drugs are paid for primarily in cash and are some times prescribed off-label, for a condition the drug was not officially approved to treat. “We actually don’t estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business.” Jonsson said. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The executives’ comments come as both Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.08%), the maker of competing medications Wegovy and Ozempic, having been working hard to curb the sale of off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They have become highly sought after because of their effectiveness at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to companies selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. “I can’t really speculate too much what’s going through the FDA’s mind. But I think other commentators have mentioned that the longer this goes on, the more risk they have to their own regulatory framework,” Ricks said about the FDA’s reversal. “And so my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they and they want to win this case, they’re putting their ducks in a row to do so.” Ricks added that the company is working on increasing its production capacity, but that regulatory process to set up new manufacturing facilities itself can take up four years. The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday showing that the all doses of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are now available. However, the drugs remain on the shortage list for now, as the agency and Novo Nordisk work to ensure a steady supply. This could signal the coming end of the Wegovy shortage, and create uncertainty for companies that sell compounded versions.

Title: Eli Lilly isn't selling as much Zepbound as expected — and the stock is sinking

Sales of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.16%) blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound are still booming, but just not at the level Wall Street was anticipating. The pharma giant posted its third-quarter earning Wednesday morning and reported sales figures well below analysts’ expectations. This led to the company’s stock falling more than 13% in Wednesday morning trading. “Lilly had another strong growth quarter in Q3, with total revenue increasing by 42% after excluding divestiture activity in the same period last year,” said Eli Lilly CEO David A. Ricks, in a press release. “While the growth of Mounjaro and Zepbound is impressive, we are equally proud of the 17% growth in non-incretin revenue, which includes our oncology, immunology, and neuroscience portfolios, compared with Q3 2023 on the same basis.” Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.81%). Sales of the company’s diabetes drug Mounjaro rose over 120% to $3.1 billion in the third-quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. However, the drug also failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations of nearly $3.8 billion in sales. Zepbound and Mounjaro belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.08%), the maker of competing medications Wegovy and Ozempic, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments.

Title: Eli Lilly Stock Tumbles as Q3 Sales, Profits Fall Well Short of Estimates

Eli Lilly (LLY) shares tumbled 12% at the opening bell Wednesday after its third-quarter results fell well short of analysts' estimates and it lowered its full-year guidance. The pharmaceutical giant registered $11.44 billion in revenue—above last year's $9.50 billion but below the $12.18 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha—as weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound continue to boost Eli Lilly's sales. However, analysts were looking for greater sales of the blockbuster drugs. Lilly swung to a profit of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, but still well below the $1.69 billion and $1.87 per share analysts were looking for. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 was barely half of the $2.18 expected. Lilly lowered its 2024 earnings per share (EPS) guidance to a range of $12.05 to $12.55 from $15.10 to $15.60, and adjusted EPS to $13.02 to $13.52 from $16.10 to $16.60. These were both driven by the $2.83 billion acquired in-progress research and development (IPR&D) charges incurred in Q3. Lilly also lowered the top of its full-year revenue range to $46.0 billion from $46.6 billion. Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO)—which has its own blockbuster drugs in Ozempic and Wegovy—have spent billions on a variety of acquisitions to help ramp up production of their weight-loss medications. Surging sales for the weight-loss drugs have boosted Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's results over the last several quarters. Eli Lilly said sales of Mounjaro more than doubled year-over-year to $3.11 billion, while Zepbound produced $1.26 billion in quarterly sales as it approaches its one-year anniversary of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, analysts were looking for $3.69 billion in Mounjaro revenue and $1.71 billion in Zepbound sales. Eli Lilly shares, which had been up more than 50% since the start of the year through Tuesday's close, fell 12% to $792.42 at the opening bell. Novo Nordisk stock fell more than 3%.

Title: Pfizer is racing to get in on the weight loss drug boom

Pfizer (PFE-0.25%) offered up some more details on its weight loss drug pipeline on Tuesday during a call with investors after it posted its third-quarter earnings report. During the call, the pharma giant shared more information on its three weight loss drug candidates and where they stand on the development cycle. Pfizer joins several other pharmaceutical companies working to introduce their own incretin weight loss meds, first popularized by Ozempic, in an effort to disrupt the weight loss duopoly currently held by Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.08%) and Eli Lilly (LLY-1.16%) . Incretin drugs are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.79%) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1s will reach $105 billion by 2030. In addition to Pfizer, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+0.63%), Roche, and Amgen, are all now developing weight loss meds. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also working on developing their own next-gen weight loss drugs. Pfizer seems to be primarily focused on incretin pills. Weight loss medications that already on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. But a pill could help with current supply constraints and open the market to patients hesitant to taking injections. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight loss pill to to enter the market. “If [danuglipron] moves fast, based on what we know right now, we should be the second oral into the market, provided that the first one will be successful and the other ones will not come before us,” Bourla said. “But so far, this is what the situation looks like. So, there is no doubt that if successful, we will have a decent market share of oral.” Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. This is the same hormone that is stimulated by drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late stage trial due to a high rate of side effects. The company instead tested modified versions of the drug and has selected one to move forward to clinical trials where various doses of the pill will be tested. Bourla said that more details from these new trial will be shared in early 2025. Bourla also said that company is testing at least two other weight loss pills in early stage clinical trials. One is once-daily GLP-1 pill that is currently in a phase 1 trial. The other one, a pill that blocks the gut hormone GIP, is expected to advance into a phase 2 trial this year. Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said on the call that this pill with a different weight loss mechanism could potentially offer “better tolerability and more efficacy.” An experimental therapy from Amgen (AMGN-0.30%), MariTide, works partly by blocking GIP, while also stimulating GLP-1. An early stage trial of MariTide found that users on the drug lost average of 14.5% of their weight in about 12 weeks.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Eli Lilly's Earnings Wednesday

As pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) plans to report third-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, analysts are focused on the production and sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound—two popular weight-loss drugs that have boosted the company's results. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect a 28% year-over-year revenue jump to $12.2 billion. Eli Lilly is projected to swing to $1.7 billion in net income from a $57.4 million net loss last year, when it reported a charge of nearly $3 billion related to "in progress research and development" (IPR&D) as it closed a number of acquisitions. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings announcement, Eli Lilly said it expects to report an IPR&D charge of about $2.83 billion for the quarter, well above the $154 million and $111 million, respectively, the company reported for the first two quarters of the year. In each of its first two quarters this year, Eli Lilly lifted its full-year outlook on the strength of sales for its weight loss drugs. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last week that they believe the drugmaker will affirm its outlook rather than raise it again. The analysts cited a shifting production environment for Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs, and said sales may have slowed in parts of the U.S. because of the impact of Hurricane Helene on some pharmacies in the Southeast U.S in the quarter. The company's weight loss drugs were dropped from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) shortage list during the quarter, as the agency currently notes the shortage of Mounjaro and Zepbound's active ingredient tirzepatide as "resolved." Both Eli Lilly and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) have seen their sales surge over the last several quarters as demand has spiked for their weight loss drugs, with each company spending billions to increase production to meet demand. Eli Lilly said in its second quarter earnings call that its supply of the drugs should improve through the back half of 2024, but said it could still face "periodic supply tightness" as demand remained high. The company also launched a lower-cost and easier-to-produce version of Zepbound in the quarter. Eli Lilly shares edged higher Monday, finishing just under $896. The stock is up more than 50% this year.

Title: AbbVie is buying an Alzheimer's drug for more than $1 billion

AbbVie (ABBV+0.12%) announced Monday that it is buying Aliada Therapeutics for $1.4 billion. The deal includes Aliada’s lead drug candidate ALIA-1758, an experimental antibody being tested for treating Alzheimer’s disease. The pharma giant said the move is part of its strategy to strengthen its neuroscience pipeline. Earlier this year, AbbVie halted development on its own Alzheimer’s treatment as a standalone therapy. “Neuroscience is one of our key growth areas and we are committed to driving innovation in this field to address critical unmet needs for patients living with seriously debilitating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,” said AbbVie chief scientific officer Roopal Thakkar in a press release. ALIA-1758 targets amyloid beta, a brain protein believed to be a cause of Alzheimer’s. The drug will also use make use of Aliada’s drug delivery technology, which helps move molecules across the blood-brain barrier for better efficacy. “Many promising CNS-targeted [central nervous system] therapies fail to reach late-stage trials due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier,” Aliada chief medical officer Michael Ryan said in the release. “Our MODEL platform addresses this challenge directly, efficiently delivering targeted drugs and potentially transforming how we treat neurological diseases.” The deal comes as the other pharma companies are working on their own new Alzheimer’s medications. Both Eli Lilly and Biogen have recently launched new Alzheimer’s drugs. Eli Lilly (LLY-1.16%) is also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial on another drug targeting amyloid beta. Recent studies have also found that GLP-1 treatments, the class of diabetes and weight loss drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.08%) Ozempic and Wegovy, are linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Novo Nordisk is currently conducting two clinical trials testing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, to see if the drug has an effect on early Alzheimer’s disease.
