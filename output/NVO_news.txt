By Bhanvi Satija (Reuters) - U.S. retail investor fund flows into Novo Nordisk (NVO) surged 32-fold on Friday, as the Danish drugmaker's weaker-than-expected obesity drug data offered a rare dip-buying opportunity, according to Vanda Research. Daily net flows climbed to $15.6 million from $0.49 million a day earlier, after eagerly anticipated data showed Novo's experimental drug, CagriSema, helped patients cut 22.7% of their weight—short of the anticipated 25%. Novo competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly (LLY) in the burgeoning market for weight-loss treatments, which is projected to exceed $150 billion in revenue within the next decade. "Retail investors love to buy dips, especially in popular stocks..and do so, until that doesn't work anymore," said Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda (VNDA). Shares of Novo Nordisk dropped 27% on Friday, erasing over $100 billion in market value. Its U.S.-listed shares tumbled 21% to $81.50, their lowest level since August 2023. "Right now Novo only dipped below S&P 500 performance for the first time in 2 years so, probably too early to see them (retail investors) give up on their buy-the dip-bias," he said. The retail flows on Friday likely provided an exit for institutional investors. Funds from retail investors touched a one-day high of $23.5 million on March 7, data from Vanda shows, after Novo's amycretin drug helped obese patients cut 13% of their weight in a study. The success of Novo’s Wegovy and Lilly’s Zepbound weight-loss drugs has revived retail interest in the healthcare sector. "With their GLP-1 product in the market and Eli Lilly being a lot on the news...a lot of retail investors know about Lilly," said Sel Hardy, vice president of equity research at CFRA. She suggested that a sell-off, like Lilly's stock dip in October, and mid-November, could provide “an attractive entry point” for retail investors Net retail flows into Lilly have outpaced Novo in the second half of 2024, according to Vanda. For Lilly, net retail purchases peaked in August after its weight-loss drug sales surpassed $1 billion for the quarter, prompting a $3 billion forecast increase. However, retail activity in these stocks lags behind tech giants such as Nvidia and Tesla, where activity often reaches the high teens.

Title: Will Novo Nordisk (NVO) Stock Recover To $145 Levels?

In contrast, its closest peer, Eli Lilly stock is down 15% over this period. NVO stock was trading around $55 in early June 2022, just before the U.S. Fed started increasing rates, and is now 60% above that level, compared to 45% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. This outperformance of NVO stock can be attributed to a ramp up in sales of its obesity drugs. Novo Nordisk is based out of Denmark. Notably, Denmark’s interest rates are lower than those in the U.S. As an aside, after dropping 20% the first half of the year, and then recovering, see Why Is Expedia Stock Up 24% This Year? NVO stock has struggled in the past few months. In fact, Novo was down over 20% on Friday, December 20, after the company reported underwhelming results from a late-stage clinical study for its obesity treatment – CagriSema. The trial showed that CagriSema helped patients reduce their weight by 22.7%, below the 25% Novo Nordisk was targeting. But, even before this fall, the stock was underperforming, with slower than anticipated sales growth for its obesity drugs. In fact, the company missed Q3 revenue and earnings estimates, weighing on its stock. While NVO stock has had a tough ride lately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. In this note, we capture trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how NVO stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. NVO stock declined from nearly $5.40 in April 2008 (pre-crisis peak for the stock) to $3.20 in early March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying it lost 40% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising about 56% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. Novo Nordisk’s revenue rose over 2x from 127 billion DKK in 2020 to 271 billion DKK for the last twelve-month period. This can primarily be attributed to the success of its diabetes and obesity drugs – Wegovy and Ozempic. While Ozempic’s sales have risen 4.5x from $21.2 billion DKK in 2020 to 95.7 billion DKK in 2023, Wegovy’s sales have surged to $31.3 billion in 2023, since its launch in 2021. The company’s operating margin has also expanded from 42.6% to 43.7% over the same period. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of 21.20 DKK per share for the last twelve month period, versus 9.01 DKK per share in 2020. Novo Nordisk’s total debt increased from 10 billion DKK in 2020 to 57 billion DKK now, while its cash increased from around 13 billion DKK to 75 billion DKK over the same period. The company also garnered 118 billion DKK in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Novo Nordisk is a net debt positive company, and it has a sufficient cash cushion to meet its near-term obligations. While the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates has helped market sentiments in the past, its recent hawkish outlook for 2025 is now worrying investors. We believe Novo Nordisk stock has the potential for some gains once markets finds a footing, digesting the news of fewer than anticipated rate cuts next year. Although the development around CagriSema doesn’t bode well for NVO stock, we think after a meaningful 40% correction from its recent highs, the headwinds appear to be priced in. Notably, the $123 average of analysts price estimates reflects a solid 45% upside potential from here. Admirably, NVO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 63% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and 55% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While NVO stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how some of its peers, such as Eli Lilly, fare on metrics that matter.
