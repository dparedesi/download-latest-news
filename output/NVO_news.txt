We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Election Day is almost here. The looming question remains how a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory will shape the market narrative for the rest of the year and beyond. Investors should soon learn the answer, with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday. In the week before the election, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1.37% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5% despite hitting its first record close since June during the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just over 0.1%. It's not the only big event of the week. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision, with markets largely anticipating that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Earnings season rolls on with a week headlined by reports from Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Moderna (MRNA). One of the top potentially market-moving events that strategists have discussed throughout the year has finally arrived with the 2024 presidential election slated for Tuesday, Nov. 5. But it's been an abnormal election year for markets. When analyzing the S&P 500's average intraday trading range, Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick found that this past October was the second-least volatile month leading into an election in the past 50 years. Zooming out further, research from Bespoke Investment Group shows the S&P 500 had its best start to an election year since 1932, with a 20% year-to-date return for the benchmark index through the end of October. Still, Election Day itself is considered a risk event for markets. Speculation has built that a "Trump Trade" has been forming in markets as the betting odds of the former president winning the election have risen. But some market strategists aren't convinced there's a clear read on what outcome investors will be rooting for come Tuesday. "I think the market would do fine with Harris," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "I think the market would do fine with Trump. I don't think the stock market is really pricing any presidential odds." Franklin Templeton chief markets strategist Stephen Dover told Yahoo Finance that the key for markets could simply be getting past the event itself. "Just having those elections settled, whichever way it goes, would be positive," Dover said. Baird market strategist Michael Antonelli agreed, telling Yahoo Finance that the riskiest scenario from the election is "one where we just don't know the winner." Markets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its next policy decision on Nov. 7. The key question entering the meeting is what the Federal Reserve will (or won't) signal about its plans for future meetings. Given that data has continued to show an economy pacing for solid growth while inflation's path down to the Fed's 2% goal remains bumpy, markets have moved to price in fewer interest rate cuts over the next year than initially thought when the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. As of Friday, markets see about three less rate cuts through the end of next year than previously thought. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Morgan Stanley chief global economist Seth Carpenter doesn't think markets will get much more clarity on the Fed's path in the coming week. "The strength in growth gives the Fed patience as it allows policy easing to be gradual," Carpenter wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Neither inflation nor unemployment is forcing the Fed's hand. We do not expect Powell to give specific guidance on the size or cadence of future cuts. Policy remains data-dependent, and neither the September 50 [basis point] cut nor the November 25 [basis point] cut indicates the future pace." The market's debate over how much easing the Fed will enact over the next year has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soaring since the last Fed meeting in September. The 10-year added about 7 basis points on Friday to close near 4.36%, its highest level since early July. Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield told Yahoo Finance that the move in rates, and the overall focus on the economic data driving them higher, is overshadowing what's shaping up to be another solid quarter of corporate results. With 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 5.1%. This would mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth as the index continues to rebound from the earnings recession seen in 2023. "We went through a two-year period where earnings were flat," Mayfield said. "They were volatile. Now we have earnings on the rise again. They're beating analyst expectations at a pretty solid clip. Profit margins are expanding. So the big picture is things look pretty good." And that story appears to be staying intact for the fourth quarter too. Since the period began at the start of October, analysts have cut estimates by 1.8%, according to FactSet data. This is in line with the average cut to earnings seen over the past 10 years. "At a certain point, earnings have to take the baton," Mayfield said. "I think we're in a good position for earnings to do that."

After a whirlwind week of tech earnings, it’s time to take a deep breath and fasten your seat belts again for another big ride. This week is expected to be intense, high-stakes, and perhaps exhausting as Americans head to the polls to decide the country’s 47th president. Election Day falls on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Hopefully, by the end of the week, the world will know who will lead the nation — Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Current polls show an incredibly close race, suggesting a tight contest that could bring volatility to markets and emotions alike. The historic event will likely impact market sentiment, and investors will need to stay tuned to stock market movements and macroeconomic indicators. Election outcomes can significantly affect the market’s direction, shaping policies that impact industries, fiscal policy, and international relations.

November 01, 2024 08:13 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 1 November 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from part 1 of the ongoing ESSENCE trial, a pivotal phase 3, 240-week, double-blinded trial in 1,200 adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3)1. Part 1 of the ESSENCE trial evaluated the effect of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg on liver tissue (histology) compared to placebo on top of standard of care for the first 800 randomised people at 72 weeks. The trial achieved its primary endpoints by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, as well as resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo. At week 72, 37.0% of people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis compared to 22.5% on placebo2. 62.9% of people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved resolution of steatohepatitis3 with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to 34.1% on placebo2. In the trial, semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous semaglutide 2.4 mg trials. “We are very pleased about the ESSENCE clinical trial results and the potential of semaglutide to help people living with MASH” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Among people with overweight or obesity, one in three live with MASH. This has a serious impact on their health and represents a significant unmet need.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approvals in the US and EU in the first half of 2025. The detailed results from ESSENCE will be presented at a scientific conference in 2024. Part 2 of the ESSENCE trial will continue with expected readout in 2029. About MASHMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. Of those who are currently overweight or living with obesity, more than one in three are also living with MASH. People living with MASH often experience few or no specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which often results in delayed diagnosis. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver cancer, is higher in people living with MASH than in the general population. About the ESSENCE trialESSENCE is a phase 3 trial evaluating the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). ESSENCE is a two-part trial where 1,200 planned participants were randomised 2:1 to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, on top of standard of care for 240 weeks. In part 1, the objective was to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improves liver histology at 72 weeks based on biopsy sampling from the first 800 randomised patients. In part 2, the objective is to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg lowers the risk of liver-related clinical events compared to placebo in adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis at 240 weeks. About semaglutide 2.4 mg Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity), adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity). In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Title: Knockoff weight loss drugs are having a moment. Eli Lilly isn't worried
URL: https://qz.com/eli-lilly-compounded-zepbound-knockoff-weight-loss-drug-1851685591
Time Published: 2024-10-30T18:32:00Z

Eli Lilly (LLY-1.24%) CEO David Ricks said the sale of cheaper, off-brand versions of the company’s blockbuster weight loss drug isn’t having a “financial impact” on the pharma giant. Ricks was referring to a practice in the industry known as compounding. When a medication is in shortage, which Eli Lilly’s Zepbound has been for most of the year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows pharmacies to make compounded, or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight loss drugs during recent shortages. “I wouldn’t characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn’t one for us,” Ricks told investors during a call on Wednesday after the company posted its third-quarter earnings report. “I think as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates us backdoor generic world.” Eli Lilly’s top leader on weight loss drugs, Patrik Jonsson, noted that these off-brand drugs are paid for primarily in cash and are some times prescribed off-label, for a condition the drug was not officially approved to treat. “We actually don’t estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business.” Jonsson said. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The executives’ comments come as both Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.82%), the maker of competing medications Wegovy and Ozempic, having been working hard to curb the sale of off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They have become highly sought after because of their effectiveness at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to companies selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. “I can’t really speculate too much what’s going through the FDA’s mind. But I think other commentators have mentioned that the longer this goes on, the more risk they have to their own regulatory framework,” Ricks said about the FDA’s reversal. “And so my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they and they want to win this case, they’re putting their ducks in a row to do so.” Ricks added that the company is working on increasing its production capacity, but that regulatory process to set up new manufacturing facilities itself can take up four years. The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday showing that the all doses of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are now available. However, the drugs remain on the shortage list for now, as the agency and Novo Nordisk work to ensure a steady supply. This could signal the coming end of the Wegovy shortage, and create uncertainty for companies that sell compounded versions.

Title: Eli Lilly isn't selling as much Zepbound as expected — and the stock is sinking

Sales of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.24%) blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound are still booming, but just not at the level Wall Street was anticipating. The pharma giant posted its third-quarter earning Wednesday morning and reported sales figures well below analysts’ expectations. This led to the company’s stock falling more than 13% in Wednesday morning trading. “Lilly had another strong growth quarter in Q3, with total revenue increasing by 42% after excluding divestiture activity in the same period last year,” said Eli Lilly CEO David A. Ricks, in a press release. “While the growth of Mounjaro and Zepbound is impressive, we are equally proud of the 17% growth in non-incretin revenue, which includes our oncology, immunology, and neuroscience portfolios, compared with Q3 2023 on the same basis.” Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS-0.84%). Sales of the company’s diabetes drug Mounjaro rose over 120% to $3.1 billion in the third-quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. However, the drug also failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations of nearly $3.8 billion in sales. Zepbound and Mounjaro belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.82%), the maker of competing medications Wegovy and Ozempic, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments.

Title: Eli Lilly Stock Tumbles as Q3 Sales, Profits Fall Well Short of Estimates

Eli Lilly (LLY) shares tumbled 12% at the opening bell Wednesday after its third-quarter results fell well short of analysts' estimates and it lowered its full-year guidance. The pharmaceutical giant registered $11.44 billion in revenue—above last year's $9.50 billion but below the $12.18 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha—as weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound continue to boost Eli Lilly's sales. However, analysts were looking for greater sales of the blockbuster drugs. Lilly swung to a profit of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, but still well below the $1.69 billion and $1.87 per share analysts were looking for. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 was barely half of the $2.18 expected. Lilly lowered its 2024 earnings per share (EPS) guidance to a range of $12.05 to $12.55 from $15.10 to $15.60, and adjusted EPS to $13.02 to $13.52 from $16.10 to $16.60. These were both driven by the $2.83 billion acquired in-progress research and development (IPR&D) charges incurred in Q3. Lilly also lowered the top of its full-year revenue range to $46.0 billion from $46.6 billion. Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO)—which has its own blockbuster drugs in Ozempic and Wegovy—have spent billions on a variety of acquisitions to help ramp up production of their weight-loss medications. Surging sales for the weight-loss drugs have boosted Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's results over the last several quarters. Eli Lilly said sales of Mounjaro more than doubled year-over-year to $3.11 billion, while Zepbound produced $1.26 billion in quarterly sales as it approaches its one-year anniversary of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, analysts were looking for $3.69 billion in Mounjaro revenue and $1.71 billion in Zepbound sales. Eli Lilly shares, which had been up more than 50% since the start of the year through Tuesday's close, fell 12% to $792.42 at the opening bell. Novo Nordisk stock fell more than 3%. UPDATE—This story has been updated with the latest share price and guidance information.
