Earlier today, Mikael Dolsten, who most recently served as the Head of R&D at Pfizer, informed Novo Nordisk that, in spite of his desire to join, he has decided to withdraw his candidacy to the Novo Nordisk Board of Directors, both as a member and as observer, due to recent personal circumstances unrelated to Novo Nordisk A/S and the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The Novo Nordisk Foundation and Novo Holdings A/S have informed Novo Nordisk that they will not propose the election of another candidate instead of Mikael Dolsten at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Instead, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and Novo Holdings A/S intend for the incoming Novo Nordisk Board of Directors to identify and nominate two candidates in addition to the already nominated Helena Saxon to the Board of Directors at Novo Nordisk’s Annual General Meeting on 26 March 2026. The other Board candidates standing for election at the 14 November 2025 extraordinary general meeting remain as announced in the 21 October 2025 convening notice. If all proposed candidates are elected, the Board of Directors will, after the extraordinary general meeting on 14 November 2026, consist of Lars Rebien Sørensen (Chair), Cees de Jong (Vice Chair), Britt Meelby Jensen, Kasim Kutay and Stephan Engels (shareholder-elected Board members) and Elisabeth Dahl Christensen, Liselotte Hyveled, Mette Bøjer Jensen and Thomas Rantzau (employee-elected Board members).
