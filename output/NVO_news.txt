Title: Novo Nordisk Cuts Around 9,000 Jobs as Weight-Loss Drugmaker Faces Growing Competition
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/novo-nordisk-slashes-jobs-as-diabetes-and-weight-loss-competition-increases-11807065
Time Published: 2025-09-10T15:06:50Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO) is making big job cuts as the weight-loss drugmaker faces growing competition. The pharmaceutical firm said it is slashing about 9,000 positions or 11.5% of its workforce. 5,000 of the cuts will be made in its home country of Denmark. The company said the layoffs are part of a “transformation” designed to simplify Novo Nordisk’s organization, speed up decision-making, and shift resources to help grow its diabetes and obesity business medicines. CEO Mike Doustdar said, “our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven.” He added the company “must evolve as well,” which means instilling “an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritizing investment where it will have the most impact—behind our leading therapy areas.” Novo Nordisk said it expects the headcount drop will result in annualized savings of about 8 billion Danish Krone ($1.25 billion) by the end of 2026. However, it also anticipates the cuts will result in a restructuring cost of 8 billion Danish Krone this year, and is now projecting operating profit will grow 4% to 10%, down from a forecast of 10% to 16% previously. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 2% in recent trading. They've lost about a third of their value this year, as rivals such as Eli Lilly (LLY) have expanded their market share in diabetes and weight-loss treatments.

Stock futures are mixed after major indexes hit new highs on Tuesday amid expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon; Oracle (ORCL) shares are surging after the company lifted it sales forecast on strong AI demand; a report on producer prices comes as investors keep a close eye on inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week; a federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook; and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announces layoffs amid slower growth in the weight loss drug market. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures were mixed after major stock indexes hit new highs on Tuesday. Investors today are watching inflation data as stocks have risen in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Fed next week. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were slightly higher this morning, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell slightly. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at around $112,400 recently, up from its overnight lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked higher to 4.09% but remains near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were slightly higher, trading near a record high, while oil futures added about 1%. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) surged more than 30% in premarket trading after the cloud computing giant said it added several large new clients and boosted its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales on booming AI demand. Oracle said it sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year as AI demand grows, up from a June forecast of more than 70%. Oracle posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 in the fiscal first quarter on revenue that rose 12% year-over-year to $14.9 billion, both below analysts' estimates as compiled by Visible Alpha. Oracle said its growing backlog from new contracts contributed to its more robust outlook. Today’s 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to show inflation at the wholesale level moderated in August. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires estimate that the PPI will show wholesale prices rose 0.3% in August, down from 0.9% the month before. The wholesale inflation numbers come ahead of tomorrow’s closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, the last major piece of inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week. The central bank has held its key rate steady this year amid concerns about the impact that tariffs are having on inflation, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled recently that rate cuts may be warranted. A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to remove Fed Gov. Lisa Cook. The injunction means Cook can stay in her role as her lawsuit challenging the dismissal moves forward. Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for not cutting interest rates, is attempting to remove the Fed governor on allegations of mortgage fraud that occurred before her appointment to the Fed's board. The judge ruled that the Federal Reserve Act limited the president’s authority to fire board members for actions that occurred before their terms, according to media reports. Cook has denied wrongdoing. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to eventually rule on Cook’s lawsuit challenging the dismissal. Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) said it plans to lay off 9,000 employees, making up more than 11% of its workforce, as the Danish drugmaker faces a slowdown in growth in the weight loss treatment market. Novo Nordisk said the layoffs will create a one-time cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion). As a result, the company said it now expects full-year operating profit growth of between 4% and 10%, down from the 10% to 16% profit growth it projected in August. The move comes after Novo Nordisk brought in a new CEO in August. U.S.-traded shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 1% in recent premarket trading.

Title: Novo Nordisk to streamline operations and reinvest for growth

September 10, 2025 01:00 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 September 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced a company-wide transformation to simplify its organisation, improve the speed of decision-making, and reallocate resources towards the company’s growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. As part of the transformation, Novo Nordisk intends to reduce the global workforce by approximately 9,000 of the 78,400 positions in the company, with around 5,000 reductions expected in Denmark. The transformation reflects the Company’s commitment to meet rising global demand while also competing in a more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market, as evidenced by the recent slowdown in growth. Over the past years, Novo Nordisk’s rapid scaling has increased organisational complexity and costs. The transformation aims at addressing that complexity, so Novo Nordisk can invest more behind its science, commercial capabilities and manufacturing ramp-up – aiming to reach the millions of people who remain untreated. Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk president and CEO, said: “As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven. Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritising investment where it will have the most impact – behind our leading therapy areas.” Investment priorities, timing and further initiatives The workforce reduction is expected across the Company, including staff areas and headquarters functions, and is expected to deliver total annualised savings of around DKK 8 billion by the end of 2026. The savings will be redirected to growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity, including commercial execution initiatives and R&D programmes. The implementation will begin immediately, and the Company expects to communicate with affected employees over the next few months, pending negotiations as per local legal labour market requirements. Further, additional initiatives are to be implemented to enhance organisational focus, performance culture and speed of decision-making as well as cost efficiencies. Novo Nordisk President and CEO Mike Doustdar added: “It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this. By realigning our resources now, we will be able to prioritise investments to drive sustainable growth and future innovation for the millions of patients with chronic diseases globally, particularly in diabetes and obesity.” One-off financial implications The company-wide transformation comes with an expected DKK 8 billion in net one-off restructuring costs, including impairment charges. Restructuring costs of around DKK 9 billion will be incurred in the third quarter of 2025, countered by savings of around DKK 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Consequently, Novo Nordisk expects an estimated one-off negative impact of around 6 percentage points on full-year operating profit growth at CER in 2025 compared to the operating profit outlook issued 6 August. This change in expectations for 2025 only factors in the one-off restructuring costs described above. The forward-looking statements section on page 26 in the Financial report for the first six months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 20/2025) also apply to this company announcement. Novo Nordisk’s disclosure of the financial results for the first nine months of 2025 and financial outlook for 2025 will be published on 5 November. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. Novo Nordisk employs about 78,400 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. Novo Nordisk's B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (Novo-B). Its ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NVO). For more information, visit novonordisk.com, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

September 07, 2025 12:10 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

(NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.
