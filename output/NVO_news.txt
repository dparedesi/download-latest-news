August 18, 2025 16:06 ET | Source: The Gross Law Firm The Gross Law Firm NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Gross Law Firm issues the following notice to shareholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). Shareholders who purchased shares of NVO during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/novo-nordisk-a-s-loss-submission-form-3/?id=161675&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 7, 2025 to July 28, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Major U.S. equities indexes were little changed Monday morning, ahead of retail sector earnings reports and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell due later in the week. Dayforce (DAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 following a report that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is in discussions to acquire the human resources software provider. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) also advanced after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s popular Wegovy weight-loss medicine to treat a serious liver disease. First Solar (FSLR) and other solar stocks gained in the wake of new guidance from the Treasury Department on federal tax incentives for clean energy projects. Citi and Jefferies analysts said the release was better than anticipated. CVS Health (CVS) shares rose following an upgrade from UBS, which pointed to the drugstore and healthcare company’s cost-cutting and improving healthcare benefits division. EQT (EQT) shares fell as the energy provider was downgraded from Roth Capital Partners on concerns an oversupply of natural gas will send prices down and hurt EQT’s results. Oil and gold futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. TradingView

(NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

August 15, 2025 17:23 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 15 August 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an additional indication for Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg) based on a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for treatment of noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. The accelerated approval is based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, in which Wegovy® demonstrated a statistically significant and superior improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, as well as resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to placebo. The clinical data from ESSENCE showed that at week 72, 36.8% of people treated with Wegovy® achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis compared to 22.4% treated with placebo. 62.9% of people treated with Wegovy® achieved resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to 34.3% treated with placebo. “Wegovy® is now uniquely positioned as the first and only GLP-1 treatment approved for MASH, complementing the already proven weight loss, cardiovascular benefits and extensive body of evidence linked to semaglutide,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, chief scientific officer and head of Research and Development, at Novo Nordisk. “MASH represents a significant health burden, with one in three people with overweight or obesity worldwide affected. In the US alone, around 22 million people are estimated to live with MASH. With the approval of Wegovy® for MASH, we provide a new treatment to people living with MASH that not only halts the disease activity but helps reverse the damage caused to the liver.” As of today, Wegovy® is available in the US for the treatment for MASH. About MASH Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. Of those who are currently overweight or living with obesity, more than one in three are also living with MASH. People living with MASH often experience few or no specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which often results in delayed diagnosis. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver cancer, is higher in people living with MASH than in the general population. About the ESSENCE trial ESSENCE is a phase 3 trial evaluating the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). ESSENCE is a two-part trial where 1,200 planned participants were randomised 2:1 to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, on top of standard of care for 240 weeks. In part 1, the objective was to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improves liver histology at 72 weeks based on biopsy sampling from the first 800 randomised patients. In part 2, the objective is to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg lowers the risk of liver-related clinical events compared to placebo in adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis at 240 weeks. Based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, Novo Nordisk has also filed for regulatory approval in the EU in February 2025, with a subsequent filing in Japan in May 2025. Part 2 of the ESSENCE trial is expected to read out in 2029. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg) The FDA initially approved Wegovy® in 2021 with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity to help adults with obesity, or adults with excess weight (overweight) who also have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and keep the weight off. The indication was expanded in 2022 to include children aged 12 years and older with obesity. In 2024, Wegovy® was approved to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Today, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Wegovy® for a new patient population for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

Title: Eli Lilly hikes Mounjaro prices in the UK to make weight-loss drug cheaper in the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Eli Lilly will significantly increase the price of its weight-loss drug Mounjaro in the United Kingdom in a bid to bring down prices in the United States after weeks of pressure from the Trump administration. The US drugmaker announced Thursday that it was rolling out price hikes across Europe, with prices rising in the UK from September. The price of a month’s supply of the highest dose of Mounjaro in the UK will rise from £122 ($165) to £330 ($447), Eli Lilly confirmed to CNN, representing a 170% increase. Eli Lilly (LLY) confirmed that prices for Mounjaro accessed through the NHS, the UK’s public health service, would remain unchanged. Around 220,000 Brits are expected to access Mounjaro, which is also used by diabetics, through the NHS in the first three years of its introduction. Private suppliers will be able to negotiate with Eli Lilly in an attempt to gain discounts. Following Eli Lilly’s announcement, Juniper, a private weight-loss clinic in the UK, published a blog offering Mounjaro patients a pathway to switch to Wegovy, a competing weight-loss jab manufactured by Danish group Novo Nordisk (NVO). In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company had originally agreed a UK list price that was significantly below the European average to prevent delays in NHS availability when Mounjaro was first launched in the country. “With changes in the environment and new clinical evidence supporting the value of Mounjaro, we are now aligning the list price more consistently to ensure fair global contributions to the cost of innovation,” the spokesperson said. US pharmaceutical companies have faced intense pressure from President Donald Trump over the disparity in drug prices between the United States and Europe. Trump has accused foreign nations of “freeloading” at the expense of American innovation. Eli Lilly said in its statement that it was committed to keeping the United States as the global leader in drug research and manufacturing. The drugmaker said it had in recent months “intensified efforts to align prices across developed countries, especially in Europe.” “This rebalancing may be difficult, but it means the prices for medicines paid by governments and health systems need to increase in other developed markets like Europe in order to make them lower in the US,” the company said in the statement. In July, Trump sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, ordering them to lower the price of prescription drugs in the United States. At the time, Chris Meekins, managing director of health policy research at Raymond James, told CNN that, while pressure from Trump may result in price increases or delayed access to drugs in other countries, it was unlikely to directly help the American consumer. Trump signed an executive order in May that aimed to force US pharmaceutical companies to bring European and US drug prices into harmony under a “Most Favored Nation” rule. While several experts have previously told CNN that Trump has limited legal power to force drugmakers to lower domestic prices, his efforts indicate a strong political will that could lead to drugmakers changing their pricing voluntarily. The president has been particularly critical of the price disparity in weight-loss drugs across the Atlantic Ocean. Speaking in May upon signing his executive order, Trump referenced a conversation with a friend who complained about the difference in the pricing of what Trump called the “fat shot drug” between the UK and the US. “He said, ‘I just paid $88, and in New York I paid $1,300. What the hell is going on?’ So, I checked, and it’s the same box made in the same plant by the same company,” Trump said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
