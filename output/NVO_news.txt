Stock futures are surging this morning after U.S. lawmakers passed a key procedural hurdle as part of an agreement that could bring an end to the shutdown that has lasted nearly six weeks; President Donald Trump has proposed issuing $2,000 “dividend” checks to Americans that would be funded by revenue from tariffs; AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is set to release its quarterly results after the closing bell today; and shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that it would be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk (NVO). Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes after the Senate passed a key procedural vote as part of an agreement to end the more-than-month-long U.S. government shutdown. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were recently up 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.5%. The major market indexes lost ground last week amid cooling momentum behind the AI trade and heightened worries over the shutdown. Bitcoin was at nearly $106,000 in recent trading, up from a low over the weekend of around $101,500 and trading at its highest level in a week. Gold futures rose more than 2% to a two-week high of just above $4,100 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences a range of consumer loans, was at 4.13%, up from Friday's close of 4.09%. The Senate on Sunday passed a procedural hurdle that could clear a path for the government to reopen after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The Senate voted 60-40 on a measure that allows other votes on an agreement that could restore funding to government agencies that have been shuttered for more than 40 days. Eight Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the agreement that would open the government through the end of January. While the agreement doesn’t address the healthcare funding cuts that were at the center of the shutdown, news reports said that there will be a vote on the subsidies in December. One consequence of the shutdown has been a freeze on economics reports from government statistical agencies, which could affect reports this week on inflation and retail sales. Government officials also began restricting some air travel last week amid staffing issues for air traffic controllers. President Donald Trump proposed issuing a $2,000 stimulus payment to Americans, saying in a social media post that tariff revenues could be used to fund the checks. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” In his post, Trump defended his tariff policies, which are currently being challenged in a Supreme Court case that challenges his authority to issue the import taxes. Earlier this year, allies of President Trump had proposed a "DOGE dividend” from savings from spending cuts. Artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report after markets close today, giving investors another look at the AI trade amid recent volatility. CoreWeave recently has announced a handful of deals with top tech firms, including a $6.3 billion initial order with AI chipmaker Nvidia and a $14.2 billion agreement with social media giant Meta. CoreWeave is expected to report that its revenue more than doubled over the year-ago period to $1.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. The firm is expected to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.35. Shares of CoreWeave, which have gained 160% since the company's initial public offering in March, were up nearly 5% in premarket trading. Shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that Pfizer (PFE) has agreed to acquire the company. Metsera said that it struck the deal with Pfizer after U.S. regulators raised worries that an offer from Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NVO) would create antitrust issues. The deal follows a reported bidding war between the two drug makers for New York-based Metsera. Pfizer will pay $86.25 per share in the transaction, which is reportedly valued at more than $10 billion. Metsera shares were down 15% ahead of the opening bell, while Pfizer shares ticked higher.
