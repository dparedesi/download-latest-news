WeightWatchers (WW) International said Friday that CEO Sima Sistani is stepping down immediately. She will be replaced by Tara Comonte, a board member and the former CEO of Shake Shack (SHAK), who was appointed as interim chief executive effective immediately. Sistani leaves the parent company of the once popular points-based weight loss program as it faces challenges in adapting to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. “On behalf of the Board, I want to sincerely thank Sima for her leadership in advancing our strategy, for adding WeightWatchers Clinic to our offerings and for her unwavering commitment to our mission,” Thilo Semmelbauer, chairman of the WeightWatchers board of directors, said in a statement. “We wish her all the best in her future endeavors.” Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatcher acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering its members the highly-coveted weight loss drugs. But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers stock is down more than 90% since the beginning of the year. In August, Sistani revealed that the struggling company would cut $100 million in costs over the next year by streamlining its operations and reducing its workforce, including a 40% cut in positions at the vice president level and above. The news comes at a time when a class of weight loss dugs known GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 39% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 68%. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has acknowledged taking weight loss drugs, left her spot on the WeightWatchers board earlier this year. She had been a member of the board since 2015. At the time, Winfrey said she was donating all her WeightWatchers shares to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. WeightWatchers said it supported Winfrey’s decision, which it added would “eliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight loss medications.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: A weight loss drug developer's stock soars after a $198 million IPO

Shares of BioAge Labs (BIOA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on obesity drugs, opened 25% above its initial public offering (IPO) price on Thursday. The Richmond, California-based company set the price for its IPO at $18 a share Wednesday evening. The company aimed to raise nearly $200 million by offering 11 million shares at this price in an upsized IPO, according to a press release. BioAge initially said that it planned to only offer 7.5 million shares between $17 to $19 each. The company’s stock initially surged 24% to over $22 per share Thursday. It is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “BIOA.” The IPO comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In an SEC filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Berenberg maintains Hold Novo Nordisk shares amid P3 data concerns

Berenberg has maintained its Hold rating on Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) (NYSE: NVO) shares with a price target of DKK975.00. The firm's stance comes in light of investor sentiments around the potential impact of the Phase 3 (P3) trial results for CagriSema, an investigational therapy by Novo Nordisk. Market response to unfavorable trial outcomes is anticipated to have a greater effect on the company's stock value compared to positive trial results. The firm acknowledges the growing uncertainty in the competitive landscape and pricing dynamics within the industry, which were previously addressed in Berenberg's report titled "Embracing the curves of obesity." These factors, combined with the pivotal nature of the CagriSema trial results, are expected to keep a lid on Novo Nordisk's stock performance for the foreseeable future. Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with a focus on diabetes care and other serious chronic conditions. In other recent news, Novo Nordisk has been in the spotlight with its CEO, Lars Jorgensen, testifying on drug pricing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The focus of the hearing was the pricing of the company's weight-loss and diabetes medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk has also been investing heavily in research and development, with $4.2 billion spent in 2023 on diabetes and obesity alone. In parallel, BMO Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on Novo Nordisk, despite the mixed results from the phase 2a trial of Monlunabant, a weight loss drug. The trial exhibited a 5.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss at 16 weeks, which surpassed the performance of previous CB1 receptor antagonists at the 52-week mark. Despite the drug's strong efficacy, increasing the dosage beyond 10mg did not yield significant additional benefits. Additionally, a lawsuit against the U.S. law mandating drug price negotiations for Medicare was revived by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This could potentially impact Novo Nordisk, as its diabetes medication, Ozempic, is under scrutiny for potential inclusion in the 2027 Medicare price negotiations. Despite disappointing results from the Phase II obesity trial of monlunabant, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on Novo Nordisk's shares. The trial showed a weight loss of approximately 6-7% at the 16-week mark, with some mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects noted. Lastly, Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a significant drop following the release of underwhelming trial results for its obesity pill, monlunabant. The trial results showed that monlunabant led to a weight loss of 6.5% after 16 weeks of treatment, which fell short of the anticipated 15% weight loss. As investors weigh Berenberg's hold rating and the potential outcomes of Novo Nordisk's CagriSema trials, it's crucial to consider the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Novo Nordisk boasts a robust market capitalization of $560.71 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the pharmaceuticals industry. The company's gross profit margin stands impressively at 84.53% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating strong profitability in its operations. InvestingPro Tips highlight Novo Nordisk's consistent dividend payments, with a track record of maintaining these for 36 consecutive years and raising them for the past 7 years. This could be a reassuring sign for investors looking for stability amidst the uncertainties surrounding the trial results. However, it's noteworthy that the company is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 41.96, suggesting a premium valuation that may already reflect high expectations from the market. For those seeking deeper insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips on Novo Nordisk, which could help investors make more informed decisions. With the next earnings date slated for November 6, 2024, keeping an eye on these metrics and the broader industry context could be pivotal.
