Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.89%), nearly doubled its annual income and investment returns in 2024. The life sciences–focused holding company reported Wednesday that its total income and investment returns reached a record 60 billion Danish krone ($8.7 billion), a 92% jump from 31.2 billion krone ($4.5 billion) the previous year. “2024 was a successful year for Novo Holdings, not only in terms of financial performance, but also in strengthening our organization with the addition of talented new colleagues,” CEO Kasim Kutay said in a press release. “In 2025, we will build on this momentum, with a particular focus on Asia as we establish an office in India.” Novo Holdings manages the assets of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and holds a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk, with 77% of voting shares. The Danish pharma company’s revenue surged 26% last year to $40.5 billion, helping drive Novo Holdings’ financial gains. The holding company expanded its portfolio slightly in 2024, adding 43 new companies while exiting 27. By year’s end, its portfolio comprised 181 companies. The company’s largest acquisition last year was the drug manufacturer Catalent. As part of the $16.5 billion deal, Novo Holdings agreed to acquire Catalent, while Novo Nordisk purchased three of its manufacturing facilities. The move aimed to ease supply shortages at the time of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said the acquisition would boost production capacity starting in 2026. Catalent manufactures nearly 70 billion doses of more than 7,000 products each year. Despite Novo Holdings’ strong financial performance, the company saw its total assets under management shrink to $153 billion from $161 billion in 2023, reflecting a drop in Novo Nordisk’s market value. The pharma giant’s stock has fallen 46% over the past 12 months, weighed down by setbacks including clinical trials that failed to meet expectations.

The use of GLP-1 meds — made popular by Ozempic (NVO-0.61%) — among U.S. adults without diabetes more than tripled between 2018 and 2022, with annual spending surging from $1.6 billion to $5.8 billion. The findings were reported by MedPageToday on Tuesday, citing a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), using an unweighted sample of 90,000 adults. They found that the percentage of U.S. adults without diabetes filling at least one GLP-1 prescription increased from 0.1% in 2018 to 0.4% in 2022 — representing approximately 854,728 adults. By comparison, about 5.1 million adults with type 2 diabetes filled a prescription for the drugs that same year, according to a separate study. The total number of people taking GLP-1 treatments today could also be much higher. In a May 2024 survey of 1,479 U.S. adults, about 12% said they’d taken a GLP-1 agonist, and almost one third said they’d heard “a lot” about these treatments, according to the health policy non-profit KFF. GLP-1s are a class of drugs that have been used for decades to treat diabetes. They mimic a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and can also suppress appetite. But a newer generation of these drugs — such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.57%) Mounjaro — has fueled a surge in demand. Unlike older versions, which required daily doses, these newer medications are injected just once a week. Demand skyrocketed even further after the drugs were approved for weight loss. Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy received approval to treat obesity in 2021, followed by Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in 2023. By 2022, 65% of GLP-1 users without diabetes were on semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Most GLP-1 users without diabetes were female (64%) and white (73%), with an average body mass index (BMI) of 35.7, classifying them as obese. The blockbuster success of these drugs has transformed Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into two of the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies. Novo Nordisk’s total revenue rose 26% in 2024 to $40.5 billion, while Eli Lilly saw a 32% jump, reaching $45 billion.

After revolutionizing the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.89%) and Eli Lilly (LLY-1.74%) are setting their sights on heart health. Both pharma giants unveiled new clinical trial results over the weekend, highlighting potential cardiovascular benefits of their medications. Novo Nordisk shared fresh data on semaglutide — the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. One study found that a weekly 2.4 mg dose led to a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events — such as heart attack, stroke, or death — among overweight or obese patients with existing cardiovascular disease, compared with a control group. Another study examined its daily semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, which showed a 14% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and some combination of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, compared with a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s chief rival, Eli Lilly, also released new heart health data. It said its experimental drug lepodisiran lowered levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) — a particle linked to cardiovascular disease — by 94% with a single injection. About 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which can double the risk of a heart attack and is linked with conditions like stroke and aortic valve stenosis. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into fewer heart attacks and strokes and large-scale clinical trials are underway to answer that question. These latest findings build on previous efforts by both companies to explore their medications’ effects on heart health. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” Martin Holst Lange, the company’s executive vice president for development, said in a press release. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded Wegovy’s approved use after Novo Nordisk announced that the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20% in a clinical trial. Meanwhile, in August, Lilly said that tirzepatide — the active ingredient in its weight-loss drug Zepbound — helped reduce heart failure risks in obese patients. Patients who took tirzepatide were 38% less likely to be hospitalized, require increased heart failure medication, or die from heart failure compared than those who received a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s shares gained 0.9% in U.S. trading on Monday, while Eli Lilly’s stock declined about 1%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 29, 2025 14:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial, demonstrating that Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)1. These new data from the phase 3b trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US and simultaneously published today in New England Journal of Medicine2. The SOUL trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with type 2 diabetes and CVD and/or CKD when treated with Rybelsus® compared to placebo. Each component of MACE, being CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, contributed to the risk reduction1. “Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of disability and death for people with type 2 diabetes, and there is a need for new, patient-centric treatments to help manage this risk,” said Darren McGuire, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Science and Teaching Professor of Medicine at UT Southwestern, US, and SOUL steering committee co-chair. “The SOUL trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or CKD demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and CV death in those treated with oral semaglutide vs placebo. The proven cardiovascular benefit reflects a profound clinical impact for our patients who now have an oral option to improve health outcomes.” Cardiometabolic diseases span a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease3. When combined, these conditions represent the leading cause of death globally4. Having type 2 diabetes directly increases the risk of developing interconnected cardiometabolic diseases, while also contributing to the progression of other cardiovascular risk factors5. Nearly one in three adults with type 2 diabetes have CVD6. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside our other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide in SOUL was consistent with that seen in previous semaglutide trials, and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in participants receiving Rybelsus® than those receiving placebo, mostly due to the higher rate of cardiovascular events and infections in the placebo group. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders (17.8% and 19.8%, respectively) and infections/infestations (15.0% and 16.5%, respectively) in the Rybelsus® and placebo arms1. In a key secondary analysis from SOUL published simultaneously, oral semaglutide reduced risk of MACE independently of baseline use of SGLT2i and suggests similar benefits in participants with and without concomitant SGLT2i use during trial7. SOUL confirmed the well-established safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient years8. Based on data from the SOUL clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Rybelsus®, which has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA. A decision is anticipated in 2025. About SOUL SOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD9,10. About Rybelsus®Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise11,12. Rybelsus® is administered once daily and is approved for use in three therapeutic dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg13,14. Rybelsus® offers superior blood glucose lowering vs Januvia® and Jardiance®13,14, together with consistent weight reduction13-15 and reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors15. Rybelsus® is currently commercially marketed in 45 countries. More than 2.1 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Rybelsus® worldwide16.

March 29, 2025 10:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from STRIDE, a phase 3b peripheral artery disease (PAD) outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly injectable Ozempic® (semaglutide 1.0 mg) in adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US1. These new data from the phase 3 trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the ACC and simultaneously published today in The Lancet2. The double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled STRIDE trial achieved its primary endpoint, with semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrating a superior and clinically meaningful improvement of 13% in maximum walking distance and a mean treatment difference of 39.9 meters on a steep incline, compared to placebo at week 52. The trial also demonstrated superiority to placebo for all confirmatory secondary outcomes assessed, including pain-free walking distance at week 52, health-related quality of life (Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6) at week 52, and maximum walking distance at week 571. “Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may cause severe symptoms, physical limitations, and a diminished quality of life, often making even short walks, such as retrieving the mail challenging. In individuals with PAD and diabetes, the disease can be even more severe, affecting small blood vessels and limiting the effectiveness of revascularization procedures and other treatments. Semaglutide 1.0 mg is the first medication in over two decades to show improvements in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as well as meaningful improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, which could address a critical unmet need for those with both PAD and type 2 diabetes," said Marc P. Bonaca, MD, Director of Vascular Research, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Lead Investigator of the STRIDE trial. “The significant improvements in walking distance and patient-reported quality of life observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg in the STRIDE trial are promising and represent an important step forward on the path to advancing treatment options for this patient population.” PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is under-screened and underdiagnosed and impacts approximately 230 million people globally3. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD, and nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. There are limited therapies available to specifically improve functional limitations in PAD, representing a significant unmet need in this population5. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The safety results from the STRIDE trial are consistent with the well-established safety and tolerability profile of once-weekly semaglutide1, supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient-years of exposure6. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (74 [19%] vs 78 [20%]). SAE probably related to treatment occurred in 2 participants (1%) in the semaglutide group and in 2 participants (1%) in the placebo group. SAE possibly related to treatment occurred in 3 (1%) and 4 (1%) participants, respectively. SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation of semaglutide or placebo were less common in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (11 [3%] vs 13 [3%]). SAEs led to the death of 3 (1%) and 8 (2%) participants in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively; however, no SAEs leading to death were treatment-related1. Based on data from the STRIDE clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Ozempic® to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision is anticipated in 2025. About STRIDE STRIDE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3b clinical trial assessing the benefit of once-weekly injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg, marketed as Ozempic®, on functional capacity. It enrolled 792 participants with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic PAD with walking-induced leg pain. The primary endpoint was maximum walking distance on a constant load treadmill for people treated with semaglutide compared to placebo at week 52. STRIDE is the only dedicated PAD functional outcomes trial with a GLP-1 RA. About PADLower extremity PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The classical symptom is intermittent claudication, associated with limited walking ability and poor health-related quality of life7. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD; nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. While anti-atherosclerotic therapies and lifestyle changes are recommended, there are no effective therapies to specifically improve functional outcomes in PAD and type 2 diabetes8. About Ozempic®Ozempic® (semaglutide) injection 0.25, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg is a once-weekly GLP-1 RA indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with known heart disease9,10. Ozempic® is currently marketed in 75 countries and 7 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Ozempic® worldwide11.
