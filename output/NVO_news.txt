The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+5.33%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.44%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-24.45%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

February 20, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
