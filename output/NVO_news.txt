Title: A new stronger Ozempic is coming. Here's what to know

Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.35%) teased some new details about a potential Ozempic successor during a call with investors Tuesday. The Danish pharma giant fielded several questions from interested analysts about its next-gen GLP-1 medication CagriSema, regarding its efficacy, safety, and supply chain. Novo Nordisk is known for its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company is working on a sequel. Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose on average 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. However, Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange told analysts he has “confidence” that larger trials will show CagriSema will help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials to arrive at that number. The company said that results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected later this year and in the first half of 2025. Novo Nordisk said the safety and tolerability of this new drug is expected to be similar to current GLP-1 drugs on the market, based on previous trials. Novo Nordisk chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said the decision to externally outsource a component of the new drug was the “rational choice” based “on a consideration around capabilities and manufacturing footprints.” He added the company is learning from its experience producing current GLP-1 drugs. “We take historic learnings with us in terms of ensuring that we have a resilient setup into the future for external sourcing approaches,” Knudsen said. In the past few years, Novo Nordisk has failed to produce enough GLP-1 meds to meet demand, which has resulted in shortages. The company is now investing billions to increase its manufacturing capacity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy continue to soar, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The Danish pharma giant posted its third-quarter earnings report early Wednesday morning and boasted sales figures blowing past analysts’ projections. “We are pleased with the performance in the first nine months of 2024. The sales growth is driven by increasing demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments, and we are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement. Sales of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy skyrocketed 79% to 17.3 billion Danish Krone ($2.5 billion) in the third-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.37 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug beat analysts’ expectations of $2.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.82%) Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. Eli Lilly reported its third-quarter earnings last week, but its blockbuster weight-loss drug failed to meet expectations. Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to FactSet.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.
