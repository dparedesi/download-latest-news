It took GLP-1 medications like Ozempic just seven years to surpass insulin as the the second most common treatment for type 2 diabetes, according to a new report by the market research and analytics firm Trilliant Health. GLP-1 drugs rose from the eighth most common drug regimen for type 2 diabetes in 2018, a year after Ozempic launched in the U.S., to the second most common in 2023, according to Trilliant’s 2024 Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report. Insulin fell to third place last year. Metformin, which regulates blood sugar levels by reducing how much glucose is released from the liver and helping the body to absorb more glucose from the bloodstream, remained on top over the past six years as the leading drug for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 drugs, which work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have also recently become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. In 2023, Ozempic was Novo Nordisk’s best-selling drug, with sales reaching 31 billion Danish kroner ($14 billion). Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk (NVO) and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. And their influence is still growing. According to Trilliant’s report, GLP-1s could boost or bring down demand for other medical treatments like gastrointestinal (GI) medications and bariatric surgeries. In the year after patients start a GLP-1 treatment, the proportion of patients with a GI-related diagnosis increased by one percentage point to 11.3% and the proportion of patients taking a GI-related medication increased by 3.7 percentage points to 33%, according to Trilliant Health Trilliant also projected that if GLP-1 drugs replaced just 20% of bariatric surgeries providers could stand to lose up to $533.4 million in revenue. “As new therapies become available and emerging evidence is incorporated into clinical guidelines, it is likely that some highmargin surgical procedures will be replaced by less invasive interventions, or there will be a decline in downstream demand,” the report said.

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company’s website. These targets include the company’s recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 — a daily pill — and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.
