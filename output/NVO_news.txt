Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/NVO. Case Details The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.

February 14, 2025 13:16 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.

Title: Novo Nordisk is facing its worst week this year — after that Hims & Hers Super Bowl ad
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-hims-hers-ad-super-bowl-1851763746
Time Published: 2025-02-14T18:07:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+5.32%) stock took a hit this week, after a Super Bowl ad highlighted a growing challenge to the company’s dominance over the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, is on track to have its worst week on Wall Street this year. Novo Nordisk shares have tumbled more than 9%, following an ad during the Super Bowl from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS-0.88%), which promoted its off-brand Ozempic. The controversial ad took a surprisingly political tone — with Donald Glover’s “This Is America” as its soundtrack — criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs. “Welcome to weight loss in America — a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,” said a narrator in the commercial. “There are medications that work — but they are priced for profits, not patients.” The ad briefly featured the company’s GLP-1 injections. The weekly treatment contains compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. In May, Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide injections for just $199 a month — hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic’s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. However, due to their high retail price, U.S. patent protections, and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy has been for years, the FDA allows pharmacies to make compounded or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs. Novo Nordisk’s executive vice president of U.S. operations, David Moore, told investors on a call last week that the compounded market is having an impact on the company’s demand, and that impact is “growing faster” than anticipated. Novo Nordisk reported, this month, that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Both Novo Nordisk, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+1.18%), have been ramping up production of their GLP-1 medications to remove them from the FDA’s drug shortage list, a goal Eli Lilly achieved late last year. The pharmaceutical giants have also filed petitions with the FDA to have their medications added to a list of drugs deemed too complex to compound safely. Novo Nordisk even took out a newspaper ad this week warning of the risks of taking copycat drugs. This isn’t Novo Nordisk’s only recent setback. In December, the company’s experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema — touted as a potential successor to Ozempic — fell short of expectations. The drug failed to hit the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by analysts and the company, with patients in a phase 3 trial shedding an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The disappointment sent Novo’s stock plunging 20% in a single day. The company’s shares are now down more than 34% over the past year, and it has lost its crown as Europe’s most valuable company to luxury conglamorate LVMH (MC+1.78%). Meanwhile, Hims & Hers has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 500% in the past year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys.

Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.
