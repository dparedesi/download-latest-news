The health benefits of blockbuster weight loss drugs are bridging the stark political divide in the United States. Progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said on Tuesday, in a Senate committee hearing on high anti-obesity drug prices, that he agreed with Elon Musk, a supporter of Former President Donald Trump, when it comes to expanding access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These treatments, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The most popular GLP-1 drugs on the market are Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk posted last week on X (TSLA), the social media platform he owns. The post was made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen Tuesday morning during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs in the U.S. Sen. Sanders said that Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at Tuesday’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. At one point, Sen. Sanders quoted Musk’s tweet and said that “Mr. Musk is right.” Later that day, Musk posted on X that he really is “with Bernie on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: A weight loss drug maker is aiming for a big IPO

BioAge Labs, a biopharmaceutical startup focused on obesity drugs, is looking to raise nearly $200 million in its recently expanded, planned initial public offering, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Richmond, California-based company said on Wednesday that it plans to offer 10.5 million shares between $17 and $19 each. BioAge previously planned to only offer 7.5 million shares at the same price range. The updated SEC filing comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In its filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s upcoming IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. BioAge isn’t the only company working to disrupt the weight loss drug duopoly dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Surging demand for weight loss medications has transformed the two pharmaceutical developers into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Now several drug makers are racing to develop their own weight loss competitors. Viking Therapeutics is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill while large pharma companies like Roche and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs.

Title: Novo Nordisk's CEO took the Washington hot seat over Ozempic prices. 3 takeaways from his testimony
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-novo-nordisk-wegovy-ceo-senate-testimony-1851656166

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed today, during a Senate committee hearing, to sit down with lawmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to look into the possibility of cutting list prices for the company’s popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs. Jørgensen was grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S. compared with other countries. Ozempic and Wegovy belong to a class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 medications. Recent trials have found these drugs have additional health benefits such as cutting heart risks and alleviating symptoms of sleep apnea. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate the global market for this drug class will reach $105 billion by 2030. Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, due to high prices, insurers have been hesitant to cover these game-changing drugs, limiting patient access. This year, several politicians, including President Joe Biden, have called on pharma companies to slash the prices of GLP-1 drugs. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into Novo Nordisk’s high prices. Jørgensen agreed in June to testify in front of the committee, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Here are the three main takeaways from today’s Senate committee hearing. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52, while it’s just $59 in Germany. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02, despite being only $92 in the U.K. Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at today’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. Jørgensen pointed out that, at the pharmacy counter, the majority of patients with insurance pay $25 or less a month out-of-pocket for those medications. “Yes, millions of Americans with decent health insurance pay minimal amounts for their prescription drugs. That’s the good news,” Sen. Sanders responded. “The bad news is that they are paying a fortune in premiums, deductibles, and c0-payments for the insurance that covers those drugs.” Both sides agreed that PBMs, third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers, play a major role in keeping drug prices high. Jørgensen claimed Ozempic’s net price — the amount Novo Nordisk is actually paid by insurance companies after rebates and discounts are applied — has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S. since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has seen its net price fall similarly. But those declines, which keep the price of these drugs hundreds of dollars more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries, have not been seen by patients. In the chief executive’s written testimony, Jørgensen claimed that “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference.” He also warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences, such as health insurers dropping them from their formularies. Sen. Sanders claimed he has received written agreements from major PBMs — including Express Scripts (CI), United Health Group (UNH), and CVS Caremark (CVS) — to not drop coverage of Ozempic and Wegovy if their list prices are drastically cut. Jørgensen agreed to work with PBMs and the committee to look into the possibility of price cuts, as long as they don’t affect patient access. “Anything that can help patients get access, I’m supportive of, and that also includes collaborating and negotiating with anyone who can help,” Jørgensen said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added, in a statement emailed to Quartz, “While no single company can fix the American healthcare system alone, we look forward to continuing to work with policymakers and other stakeholders toward meaningful solutions for the people who rely on our medicines.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Novo Nordisk CEO blames drug 'middlemen' for high price of weight loss meds

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will shift the blame for the high prices of the company’s popular weight loss treatments to drug middlemen and the ‘complex’ U.S. health care system today during a committee hearing in Congress. Jørgensen is set to be grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, over what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S compared to other countries. “You have said that our amazing medicines can’t help patients if they can’t afford them. That is true,” Jørgensen plans to say during prepared opening remarks shared with Quartz. He adds, “it is clear that patients too often struggle to navigate the complex U.S. healthcare system. It is also clear that no single company can solve such vast and complicated policy changes.” In the chief executive’s written testimony, he goes on to specifically point the finger toward pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers. Jørgensen wrote that the net price — the amount that Novo Nordisk is actually paid after manufacturer rebates and discounts are applied — of Ozepmic has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S., since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has also seen its net price fall simlarily. However, “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference,” Jørgensen wrote. He warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences like health insurers dropping them from their formularies. The U.S. list price for Ozempic is $968.52 a month and $1,349.02 for Wegovy. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month, well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Wegovy’s U.S. net price is $809, while it costs just $92 in the United Kingdom. Jørgensen agreed to testify in front of the committee in June, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Last week, Sen. Sanders said that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for less than $100.

China issued a series of stimulus measures to boost its hard-hit economy and housing market; U.S. stock futures are little changed after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday at record highs; Boeing's (BA) "best and final" offer is rejected by its striking union workers; Novo Nordisk (NVO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen faces a Senate hearing over the high cost of its weight-loss drugs; and Tesla (TSLA) shares are continuing to rise on Wall Street's optimism around its China and robotaxi operations. Here's what investors need to know today. China issued a broad stimulus package of monetary measures to boost a sluggish economy weighed down by a housing market slump and weak consumer sentiment. Beijing cut a key short-term interest rate, reduced rates on existing mortgages, lowered the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and announced plans for at least 800 billion yuan ($114 billion) of liquidity to shore up the struggling stock market. Crude oil futures—under pressure from weak demand in the Asian nation—rose, while American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) are gaining 5% in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes closed up Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both finishing at fresh record highs. U.S. shares have been boosted in recent days by the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in more than four years, and investors are now on watch for more Fed comments as officials say that upcoming economic data will determine the size of future rate cuts. Boeing (BA) offered what it called its "best and final" offer to workers who have been striking since mid-September, crippling the plane maker's operations. Boeing offered the striking members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union base wage increases of 30% over four years, up from its previous offer of a 25% increase. The union dismissed the offer in an X post, saying the contract "was thrown at us without any discussion." Novo Nordisk (NVO) ADRs are rising 1% in premarket trading ahead of a Senate hearing on the high costs of the Danish company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which has accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. Telsa (TSLA) shares are trading 1% higher in premarket trading after leading S&P 500 gainers Monday with an almost 5% jump, as analysts highlighted several potential catalysts that could provide a boost for the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. Barclays analysts said that based on data points from China, Tesla could exceed expectations with its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, while analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also suggested Tesla could impress investors with its robotaxi event next month.

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Monday, a day before a Senate hearing on the costs of the company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

U.S. equities were up slightly at midday to start the new week after last week's excitement over the Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point (bps) interest-rate cut sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all in the green. Tesla (TSLA) shares gained after Goldman Sachs said next month's planned robotaxi reveal could be a catalyst for the stock. Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Erie Indemnity (ERIE) were higher on their first day as members of the S&P 500. Shares of Newmont (NEM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), and other gold miners advanced as the price of the precious metal hit a record high. General Motors (GM) shares declined after Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mary Barra reiterated that the automaker would make only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 even as EV demand slows. Shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped when TD Cowen downgraded the stock, citing lower demand and increasing competition. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slipped ahead of tomorrow's Senate hearing on the drug maker's pricing of its wildly popular Wegovy and Ozempic weight-loss treatments. Oil prices were lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly. The U.S. dollar climbed against the euro, but lost ground to the pound and yen.
