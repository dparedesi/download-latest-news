May 07, 2025 01:30 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S 7 May 2025 - Financial report for the period 1 January 2025 to 31 March 2025 Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, president and CEO: "In the first quarter of 2025, we delivered 18% sales growth and continued to expand the reach of our innovative GLP-1 treatments. However, we have reduced our full-year outlook due to lower-than-planned branded GLP-1 penetration, which is impacted by the rapid expansion of compounding in the US. We are actively focused on preventing unlawful and unsafe compounding and on efforts to expand patient access to our GLP-1 treatments. Within R&D, we are pleased to have completed the last pivotal trial for our next-generation obesity treatment, CagriSema, and to have filed for US approval of oral semaglutide 25 mg, with the potential to be the first oral GLP-1 treatment for obesity."
