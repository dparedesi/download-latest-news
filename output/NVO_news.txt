Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes to kick off the holiday-shortened trading week; market participants are growing increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month; bitcoin regained some ground over the weekend after weeks of declines; U.S. officials are in Europe for tariff negotiations; and Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares are sinking following the results of its latest drug trial. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher this morning after experiencing significant volatility last week amid growing concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Stocks rose on Friday after a Federal Reserve official suggested support for an interest rate cut in December, but the three major indexes each posted big losses for the week. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and will have an abbreviated trading session on Friday, but there are plenty of earnings reports and economic data in the next few days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs for all sorts of loans, was at 4.04% recently, down slightly from Friday's close and trading at its lowest level in nearly a month. Gold futures and crude oil futures were down slightly. Market participants now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate next month, after New York Fed President John Williams on Friday said that there may be "room for a further adjustment". Traders are now pricing in nearly a 75% cut at the Fed's Dec. 9-10 policy meeting, up from around 40% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data. The Fed trimmed its key fed funds rate at each of the past two meetings—in September and October—amid rising concerns about the health of the labor market. Fed officials recently have been divided in their views about whether another cut is warranted, amid ongoing concerns about inflationary pressure. Stocks tied to cryptocurrencies are gaining ground in premarket trading Monday, as bitcoin trades above the lows it hit at the end of last week. Bitcoin was at $86,000 recently, down from an overnight high of around $88,000 but up from Friday's level near $81,000, which was its lowest level since April. After trading as high as $125,000 in early October, the digital asset has tumbled in recent weeks as investor risk appetite waned amid concerns about the AI trade and uncertainty about the Fed's next move. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, were up nearly 2% recently. Shares of bitcoin miner Mara Holdings (MARA) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up nearly 3%. American officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are in Europe Monday for a new round of trade negotiations. Ahead of the meeting, European Union officials said that they did not expect to reach a deal to lower tariffs on steel and other goods in the first day of talks, per Bloomberg. As of their last agreement earlier this year, the U.S. currently has a 15% tariff on most goods coming into the country from the E.U., along with a 50% tax on a range of products made with steel and aluminum. Shares of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) are down sharply this morning after the Ozempic maker's latest drug trial's results disappointed. The company had been looking to determine whether semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also slow the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. The trial's goal was to slow the decline by at least 20%, CNBC reported, but Novo Nordisk said Monday that although the drug did improve unspecified "biomarkers" related to Alzheimer's, it did not slow the progression of the disease itself. Analysts had been uncertain of how likely the trial was to achieve its goals, and about whether demand for Ozempic and Wegovy are still growing. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-traded shares were down more than 10% ahead of the opening bell.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Evoke phase 3 trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in Alzheimer's disease progression

November 24, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced the top-line results from the 2-year primary analysis of evoke and evoke+ phase 3 trials in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The two trials were randomised, double-blinded, enrolled a total of 3808 adults and evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. The decision to pursue an Alzheimer’s disease indication with semaglutide was based on real-world evidence studies, pre-clinical models as well as post-hoc analyses from diabetes and obesity trials. The evoke and evoke+ trials did not confirm superiority of semaglutide versus placebo in the reduction of progression of Alzheimer’s disease, as measured by the change in Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to baseline. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers in both trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression. In the evoke trials with patients aged 55-85, suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous semaglutide trials. To date, more than 37 million patient-years of semaglutide exposure have occurred across diverse patient populations. “Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer’s disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide’s potential, despite a low likelihood of success. We are proud to have conducted two well-controlled phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease that meet the highest standards of research and rigorous methodology,” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “We sincerely thank all participants and their caregivers for their meaningful contributions. While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities.” The 1-year extension period in the evoke and evoke+ trials will be discontinued based on the efficacy results observed in the overall study population. Topline results from the evoke/evoke+ trials will be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference on 3 December 2025, and full results at the 2026 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Conferences (AD/PD) in March 2026. About Alzheimer’s diseaseAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually worsen over time. Each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that can slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and reduce the overall burden on people affected and on society. About Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of BoxesThe Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) is a global measure of cognition and function obtained by interviewing both patient and care partner, commonly used staging tool for Alzheimer’s disease in research settings. It measures six areas covering cognition and function, where each area is scored between 0 (no dementia) and 3 (severe dementia). The summary score of the six areas (maximum score of 18), referred to as sum of boxes (CDR-SB) has been applied to clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease to track progression and assess disease severity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, the change in CDR-SB for semaglutide compared to placebo was measured from baseline to week 104. About the evoke/evoke+ studiesEvoke and evoke+ are large-scale trials investigating the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in people with Alzheimer’s disease. They are global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trials included men or women aged 55–85 years with MCI (defined as CDR global of 0.5) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (defined as CDR global score of 1.0) with confirmed amyloid positivity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, 1,855 and 1,953 people respectively, were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension). About semaglutideSemaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand names Ozempic® and Rybelsus® for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy® for the treatment of chronic weight management.
