The pill version of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.52%) blockbuster drug Ozempic was found to cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events in a late-stage clinical trial. The Danish pharma giant announced Monday that the oral form of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, was shown to reduce the risk of major adverse heart events by 14% among people with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease, compared with patients who were given a placebo. Oral semaglutide is branded as Rybelsus in the United States and is currently approved for treating Type 2 diabetes. The company’s Phase 3 “SOUL” trial had nearly 10,000 patients enrolled and assessed the effect of oral semaglutide on heart health outcomes over three years. “We are pleased to see that the results from SOUL demonstrate that oral semaglutide reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and that the benefits of oral semaglutide come on top of standard of care,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. “Approximately one in three adults with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is crucial to have therapies that can address both conditions.” Novo Nordisk said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the approved use of Rybelsus to include reducing the risk of adverse heart events. The news comes as both Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-1.48%) are working to get more approved uses of their GLP-1 treatments beyond diabetes and weight loss. These additional approvals make it easier for health insurers to cover the medications. GLP-1s are a popular class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and reduces appetite. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound (both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss), into the largest pharma companies in the world. In March, the FDA expanded the approved use of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, months after the company announced results from a clinical trial that found the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20%. This opened the path for the weight loss drug to get coverage from Medicare. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly announced results from clinical trials that found tirzepatide, the drug behind Mounjaro and Zepbound, helped with sleep apnea and heart failure.

Title: I'm a pharmacist. Knockoff Ozempic and other weight loss products have serious hidden risks

In just a few years, brand-name injectable drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have rocketed to fame as billion-dollar annual sellers for weight loss as well as to control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. But the price of these injections is steep: They cost about $800-$1,000 per month, and if used for weight loss alone, they are not covered by most insurance policies. Both drugs mimic the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1 to help regulate blood sugar and reduce cravings. They can be taken only with a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration announced an official shortage of the active ingredients in these drugs in 2022, but on Oct. 2, 2024, the agency announced that the shortage has been resolved for the medicine tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro (LLY-1.47%) and Zepbound. Despite the soaring demand and limited supply of these drugs, there are no generic versions available. This is because the patents for semaglutide – the active ingredient in Ozempic (NVO-0.50%) and Wegovy, which is still in shortage – and tirzepatide don’t expire until 2033 and 2036, respectively. As a result, nonbrand alternatives that can be purchased with or without a prescription are flooding the market. Yet these products come with real risks to consumers. I am a pharmacist who studies weaknesses in federal oversight of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements in the U.S. My research group recently has investigated loopholes that are allowing alternative weight loss products to enter the market. The dietary supplement market has sought to cash in on the GLP-1 demand with pills, teas, extracts and all manner of other products that claim to produce similar effects as the brand names at a much lower price. Products containing the herb berberine offer only a few pounds of weight loss, while many dietary supplement weight loss products contain stimulants such as sibutramine and laxatives such as phenolphthalein, which increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer. Poison control centers have seen a steep rise in calls related to off-brand weight loss medications. Unlike the dietary supplements that are masquerading as GLP-1 weight loss products, compounding pharmacies can create custom versions of products that contain the same active ingredients as the real thing for patients who cannot use either brand or generic products for some reason. These pharmacies can also produce alternative versions of brand-name drugs when official drug shortages exist. Since the demand for GLP-1 medications has far outpaced the supply, compounding pharmacies are legally producing a variety of different semaglutide and tirzepatide products. These products may come in versions that differ from the brand-name companies, such as vials of powder that must be dissolved in liquid, or as tablets or nasal sprays. Just like the brand-name drugs, you must have a valid prescription to receive them. The prices range from $250-$400 a month – still a steep price for many consumers. Compounding pharmacies must adhere to the FDA’s sterility and quality production methods, but these rules are not as rigorous for compounding pharmacies as those for commercial manufacturers of generic drugs. In addition, the products compounding pharmacies create do not have to be tested in humans for safety or effectiveness like brand-name products do. Proper dosing can also be challenging with compounded forms of the drugs. For people who cannot afford a compounding pharmacy product, or cannot get a valid prescription for semaglutide or tirzepatide, opportunistic companies are stepping in to fill the void. These include “peptide companies,” manufacturers that create non-FDA approved knockoff versions of the drugs. From November 2023 to March 2024, my team carried out a study to assess which of these peptide companies are selling semaglutide or tirzepatide products. We scoured the internet looking for these peptide companies and collected information about what they were selling and their sales practices. We found that peptide sellers use a loophole to sell these drugs. On their websites, the companies state that their drugs are for “research purposes only” or “not for human consumption,” but they do nothing to verify that the buyers are researchers or that the product is going to a research facility. By reading the comments sections of the company websites and the targeted ads on social media, it becomes clear that both buyers and sellers understand the charade. Unlike compounding pharmacies, these peptide sellers do not provide the supplies you need to dissolve and inject the drug, provide no instructions, and will usually not answer questions. Peptide sellers, since they allegedly are not selling to consumers, do not require a valid prescription and will sell consumers whatever quantity of drug they wish to purchase. Even if a person has an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, the companies will happily sell them a semaglutide or tirzepatide product without a prescription. The average prices of these peptide products range from $181-$203 per month. Peptide sellers do not have to adhere to the rules or regulations that drug manufacturers or compounding pharmacies do. Many companies state that their products are 99% pure, but an independent investigation of three companies’ products from August 2023 to March 2024 found that the purity of the products were far less than promised. One product contained endotoxin – a toxic substance produced by bacteria – suggesting that it was contaminated with microbes. In addition, the products’ promised dosages were off by up 29% to 39%. Poor purity can cause patients to experience fever, chills, nausea, skin irritation, infections and low blood pressure. In this study, some companies never even shipped the drug, telling the buyers they needed to pay an additional fee to have the product clear customs. If a consumer is harmed by a poor-quality product, it would be difficult to sue the seller, since the products specifically say they are “not for human consumption.” Ultimately, consumers are being led to spend money on products that may never arrive, could cause an infection, might not have the correct dose, and contain no instructions on how to safely use or store the product. To combat these alternative sellers, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly began offering an alternative version of its brand-name Zepbound product for weight loss in September 2024. Instead of its traditional injection pen products that cost more than $1,000 for a month’s supply, this product comes in vials that patients draw up and inject themselves. For patients who take 5 milligrams of Zepbound each week, the vial products would cost them $549 a month if patients buy it through the company’s online pharmacy and can show that they do not have insurance coverage for the drug. After a grilling on Capitol Hill in September 2024, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk came under intense pressure to offer patients without prescription coverage a lower-priced product for its brand-name Wegovy as well. In the next few years, additional brand-name GLP-1 agonist drugs will likely make it to market. As of October 2024, a handful of these products are in late-phase clinical trials, with active ingredients such as retatrutide, survodutide and ecnoglutide, and more than 18 other drug candidates are in earlier stages of development. When new pharmaceutical companies enter this market, they will have to offer patients lower prices than Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in order to gain market share. This is the most likely medium-term solution to drive down the costs of GLP-1 drugs and eliminate the drug shortages in the marketplace. C.

On Monday, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) released the headline results from the SOUL Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial. Last year, Novo Nordisk’s subcutaneous once-weekly (injectable) semaglutide 2.4 mg, available as Wegovy, showed a 20% reduction in MACE compared to placebo. The SOUL trial compared oral semaglutide to placebo as an adjunct to the standard of care to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as cardiac arrest, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019 and enrolled 9,650 people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Also Read: Novo Nordisk’s Weight Loss Drug Ozempic Associated With Reduced Opioid, Alcohol Use Disorder Incidences, Study Shows. Oral semaglutide is administered once daily and is approved for use in three doses, 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg, under the brand name Rybelsus. It is indicated for adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise. As part of the standard of care, 49% of patients received SGLT2i at some point during the trial. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in MACE of 14% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. All three primary endpoint components contributed to the superior MACE reduction demonstrated by oral semaglutide. In the trial, oral semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous oral semaglutide trials. Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of a label expansion for Rybelsus in the US and EU around late 2024 or early 2025. The detailed results from SOUL will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. In 2023, Rybelsus generated global revenues of DKK18.75 billion (around $2.73 billion).

October 21, 2024 05:26 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 21 October 2024 — Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial. The double-blinded, randomised trial compared oral semaglutide to placebo as an adjunct to standard of care for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The trial enrolled 9,650 people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). As part of standard of care, 49% of patients received SGLT2i at some point during the trial. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in MACE of 14% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to placebo1. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. All three components of the primary endpoint contributed to the superior MACE reduction demonstrated by oral semaglutide. In the trial, oral semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous oral semaglutide trials. "We are pleased to see that the results from SOUL demonstrate that oral semaglutide reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and that the benefits of oral semaglutide come on top of standard of care,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Approximately one in three adults with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is crucial to have therapies that can address both conditions.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of a label expansion for Rybelsus® in both the US and EU around the turn of the year. The detailed results from SOUL will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the SOUL trialSOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. About Rybelsus® Oral semaglutide is administered once daily and is approved for use in three doses, 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg, under the brand name Rybelsus®. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In the EU, a new formulation of 1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg doses of Rybelsus® are approved and are bioequivalent to the original formulation of Rybelsus®. 1Based on treatment policy estimand: treatment effect regardless of treatment adherence Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.
