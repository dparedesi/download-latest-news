A Brazilian politician is making an interesting campaign pitch: Ozempic for all. Eduardo Paes, the current mayor of Rio de Janeiro, is seeking reelection and just promised to make a generic version of Ozempic available through the city’s public health network, if he wins. “I took a lot of Ozempic, that little medicine that is helping everyone lose weight,” Paes told the Brazilian newspaper Extra on Tuesday, adding that he lost 66 pounds. “Its patent will expire next year, and it will be available as a generic and I will introduce it to the entire public health system,” Paes said. “Rio will be a city where there will be no more fat people, everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics.” Ozempic, produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO), is a GLP-1 treatment for diabetes. It works by mimicking a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite, and as a result has become highly sought after for its weight loss effects. Skyrocketing sales for GLP-1 medications have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. In Brazil, a month’s supply of Ozempic costs about 1,000 Brazilian Reals ($182.36). Its patent in the country is set to expire sometime in the next two years, allowing for cheaper generic versions of the drug to enter the market. Paes’s remarks have gone viral on social media and have been criticized by his opponents. Alexandre Ramagem, another candidate running for mayor, posted a video on his Instagram account of Rio resident complaining about a lack of basic medicines in the family clinics. Tarcísio Motta, who is also running for mayor, told Brazilian media that Paes comments were “disrespectful to the diversity of bodies” in the city and an “encouragement of fatphobia.” Paes responded to his critics and said that he is not fatphobic. “When the patent is broken, which should happen in 2025 or 2026, it will reduce the cost enormously,” Paes said. “Why not make it available to the population? We’re not going to give it away for vain reasons. It’s not to make six-packs.” Paes’s comments come as governments around the world are trying to expand access to GLP-1 drugs. England’s National Health Services (NHS) announced today a plan to provide Eli Lilly’s weight loss drug to nearly a quarter million people over three years. In September, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in a a Senate committee hearing, called on Novo Nordisk to slash the list price of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States, where they currently cost $968 per month.

Title: Zepbound is no longer in shortage. Hims & Hers stock took a hit because of it

The shortage of Eli Lilly’s (LLY) blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday, marking the popular drugs’ shortages as resolved. The news could put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand versions of GLP-1 weight loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring demand for these treatments have transformed Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Skyrocketing demand has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro was added to the FDA’s drug shortage database in 2022, while Zepbound was added this April. “Because Lilly’s FDA-approved medicines are available, patients should not be exposed to the higher risks posed by untested, unapproved knockoffs,” an Eli Lilly spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “The entities currently mass-producing and mass-marketing compounded and counterfeit tirzepatide need to stop immediately.” The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS), which recently began offering a compounded version of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy — saw its stock drop by over 11% during Wednesday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brandname weight loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. Geoff Cook, CEO of the weight loss app Noom, which recently began offering compounded semaglutide to its members, urged regulators in September to proceed cautiously when considering lifting the shortage declaration for brandname weight loss drugs. He warned that ending the declaration too soon could restrict consumers’ access to more affordable alternatives. “We just continue to urge policy makers to take into account the fact that patients losing access to their medication is not a good thing and especially losing it over night would be not a good thing,” Cook told Quartz on Wednesday. If and when the FDA declares an end to the semaglutide shortage, Cook said Noom would continue offering branded GLP-1 treatments and other weight loss medications to its members. The company may also explore offering even more customized compounded versions of semaglutide that can be taken sublingually, instead of by injection. Additionally, Cook supports efforts by Rep. Lloyd Doggett and Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has urged Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to help lower the cost of semaglutide by using existing law to allow for generic competition, ahead of patent expirations. In the short term, Cook expects patients who were on compounded tirzepatide to switch over to a compounded semaglutide treatment.

We’re only a few months a way from the end of the year, but pharma companies still have a steady stream of clinical trial results to announce before then. Several companies — including Novo Nordisk (NVO), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Amgen (AMGN) — are expecting to post the results of their next-gen weight loss drugs. Plus, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) is set to share preliminary findings from a trial testing CTX112, a genetically engineered cell therapy for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, Moderna (MRNA) may be on the verge of launching a new product beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. Check out all these and more must-watch clinical trials. 2 / 10 AbbVie (ABBV) bought Cerevel Therapeutics earlier this year for $9 billion. The deal included Cerevel’s “potential best-in-class, next-generation antipsychotic,” emraclidine. The experimental drug is now undergoing two six-week-long phase 2 trials to see how effective it is at alleviating symptoms of schizophrenia. Results are expected to be posted by the end of the year. AbbVie is competing with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), which is awaiting a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of its new schizophrenia treatment, KarXT, this fall. 3 / 10 Biogen (BIIB), traditionally focused on neurology, is intensifying its shift towards immunology. Soon, we’ll know how successful its efforts have been when they post results from a phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol, a potential new treatment for the autoimmune disorder lupus. 4 / 10 Moderna is still seeking its next major product as COVID-19 vaccine sales continue to dwindle. One promising opportunity is a vaccine for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common congenital infection — present at birth — with no existing vaccines. CMV can cause serious health problems in newborns and those with weakened immune systems. Moderna is expected to announce initial results of its late-stage trial of its CMV vaccine by the end of the year. 5 / 10 Neuroscience startup Neumora Therapeutics is developing navacaprant, a novel depression treatment that works by inhibiting kappa opioid receptors, which play a key role in regulating mood, pain, and stress. The company is expected to announce results from the first of three phase 3 trials testing navacaprant for depression in the fourth quarter of this year. 6 / 10 Novo Nordisk, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is developing a more potent obesity treatment called CagriSema. This new drug combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, with amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. Results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected this year. 7 / 10 Viking Therapeutics is set to present results of a phase1 trial testing higher doses of the oral version of its VK2735 weight loss drug at The Obesity Society’s Obesity Week in early November. Analysts at JP Morgan expect the company’s stock to jump following the presentation. A previous small clinical study found that patients taking a daily 40mg dose of Viking’s weight loss pill lost an average of up to 5.3% of their body weight in just 28 days. 8 / 10 Amgen is presenting results of a phase 2 trial of its experimental weight loss drug in late 2024. “The interim phase 2 analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with results that we’ve seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial,” Amgen CEO Robert Bradway told investors in May. Additionally, the company is already planning a larger phase 3 trial of the drug. An early-stage trial of MariTide found that users on the drug lost average of 14.5% of their weight in about 12 weeks. 9 / 10 CRISPR Therapeutics is using CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop genetically engineered cells, CTX112, that target CD19 — a protein that is used to diagnose cancerous white blood cells. Preliminary results from these trails are expected this year. 10 / 10

Title: GLP-1s like Ozempic are now more popular than insulin for treating diabetes

It took GLP-1 medications like Ozempic just seven years to surpass insulin as the the second most common treatment for type 2 diabetes, according to a new report by the market research and analytics firm Trilliant Health. GLP-1 drugs rose from the eighth most common drug regimen for type 2 diabetes in 2018, a year after Ozempic launched in the U.S., to the second most common in 2023, according to Trilliant’s 2024 Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report. Insulin fell to third place last year. Metformin, which regulates blood sugar levels by reducing how much glucose is released from the liver and helping the body to absorb more glucose from the bloodstream, remained on top over the past six years as the leading drug for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 drugs, which work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have also recently become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. In 2023, Ozempic was Novo Nordisk’s best-selling drug, with sales reaching 31 billion Danish kroner ($14 billion). Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk (NVO) and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. And their influence is still growing. According to Trilliant’s report, GLP-1s could boost or bring down demand for other medical treatments like gastrointestinal (GI) medications and bariatric surgeries. In the year after patients start a GLP-1 treatment, the proportion of patients with a GI-related diagnosis increased by one percentage point to 11.3% and the proportion of patients taking a GI-related medication increased by 3.7 percentage points to 33%, according to Trilliant Health Trilliant also projected that if GLP-1 drugs replaced just 20% of bariatric surgeries providers could stand to lose up to $533.4 million in revenue. “As new therapies become available and emerging evidence is incorporated into clinical guidelines, it is likely that some highmargin surgical procedures will be replaced by less invasive interventions, or there will be a decline in downstream demand,” the report said.

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company’s website. These targets include the company’s recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 — a daily pill — and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.
