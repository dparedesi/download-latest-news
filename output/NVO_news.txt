As pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) plans to report third-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, analysts are focused on the production and sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound—two popular weight-loss drugs that have boosted the company's results. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect a 28% year-over-year revenue jump to $12.2 billion. Eli Lilly is projected to swing to $1.7 billion in net income from a $57.4 million net loss last year, when it reported a charge of nearly $3 billion related to "in progress research and development" (IPR&D) as it closed a number of acquisitions. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings announcement, Eli Lilly said it expects to report an IPR&D charge of about $2.83 billion for the quarter, well above the $154 million and $111 million, respectively, the company reported for the first two quarters of the year. In each of its first two quarters this year, Eli Lilly lifted its full-year outlook on the strength of sales for its weight loss drugs. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last week that they believe the drugmaker will affirm its outlook rather than raise it again. The analysts cited a shifting production environment for Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs, and said sales may have slowed in parts of the U.S. because of the impact of Hurricane Helene on some pharmacies in the Southeast U.S in the quarter. The company's weight loss drugs were dropped from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) shortage list during the quarter, as the agency currently notes the shortage of Mounjaro and Zepbound's active ingredient tirzepatide as "resolved." Both Eli Lilly and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) have seen their sales surge over the last several quarters as demand has spiked for their weight loss drugs, with each company spending billions to increase production to meet demand. Eli Lilly said in its second quarter earnings call that its supply of the drugs should improve through the back half of 2024, but said it could still face "periodic supply tightness" as demand remained high. The company also launched a lower-cost and easier-to-produce version of Zepbound in the quarter. Eli Lilly shares edged higher Monday, finishing just under $896. The stock is up more than 50% this year.

Title: AbbVie is buying an Alzheimer's drug for more than $1 billion

AbbVie (ABBV-0.11%) announced Monday that it is buying Aliada Therapeutics for $1.4 billion. The deal includes Aliada’s lead drug candidate ALIA-1758, an experimental antibody being tested for treating Alzheimer’s disease. The pharma giant said the move is part of its strategy to strengthen its neuroscience pipeline. Earlier this year, AbbVie halted development on its own Alzheimer’s treatment as a standalone therapy. “Neuroscience is one of our key growth areas and we are committed to driving innovation in this field to address critical unmet needs for patients living with seriously debilitating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,” said AbbVie chief scientific officer Roopal Thakkar in a press release. ALIA-1758 targets amyloid beta, a brain protein believed to be a cause of Alzheimer’s. The drug will also use make use of Aliada’s drug delivery technology, which helps move molecules across the blood-brain barrier for better efficacy. “Many promising CNS-targeted [central nervous system] therapies fail to reach late-stage trials due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier,” Aliada chief medical officer Michael Ryan said in the release. “Our MODEL platform addresses this challenge directly, efficiently delivering targeted drugs and potentially transforming how we treat neurological diseases.” The deal comes as the other pharma companies are working on their own new Alzheimer’s medications. Both Eli Lilly and Biogen have recently launched new Alzheimer’s drugs. Eli Lilly (LLY+0.76%) is also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial on another drug targeting amyloid beta. Recent studies have also found that GLP-1 treatments, the class of diabetes and weight loss drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) Ozempic and Wegovy, are linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Novo Nordisk is currently conducting two clinical trials testing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, to see if the drug has an effect on early Alzheimer’s disease.

Title: Weight loss drugs have yet to lower patients' health care costs

GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy (NVO-0.35%) might help with weight loss, but they aren’t leading to lower health care costs yet, according to a new analysis of U.S. health insurance claims. A review by pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, and reported by Reuters, found that patients with obesity incurred average annual medical costs of $18,507 two years after starting GLP-1 drugs, a 46% increase from before they were on the drugs. For comparison, medical costs for a control group not using GLP-1 drugs rose by 14% over the same period. The analysis found that prescription drug costs were the primary driver of these increases, with other medical expenses also rising during the two years on the drug. It showed no reduction in obesity-related medical events — such as heart attacks, strokes, and type 2 diabetes diagnoses, compared to the control group. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.76%) — the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss — into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know However, many U.S. employers and government insurance programs have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Prime Therapeutics analyzed the pharmacy and medical claims of 3,046 commercially insured patients who received new GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity in 2021, excluding those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Among the GLP-1 users, 46% were taking Wegovy or Ozempic, while others were on Saxenda, Victoza, Rybelsus, or Lilly’s Trulicity. Newer drugs, such as Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, were not included since they launched after study started. The analysis also highlighted adherence challenges. Only 25% of patients who were prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic for weight loss were still taking the medication two years later. This low adherence rate makes it challenging to replicate the results shown in clinical trials, according to Prime Therapeutics VP for pharmacy clinical services David Lassen. “I don’t think it’s fully conclusive at this point,” Lassen told Reuters (TRI+0.10%). He noted that more data and time may be necessary to fully gauge the costs. “We want to do everything possible to help individuals achieve the positive outcomes of being on this medication,” Lassen said. “But if we determine there is not a positive outcome with our data and there is not a return on investment, that will be an inflection point ahead that we will have to consider.” Prime’s assistant VP for health outcomes Patrick Gleason estimated that GLP-1 drugs will cost employers and insurers about $11,200 more per patient over the first two years, despite discounts and rebates. The company said that fewer than 20% of its members have coverage for these weight-loss drugs. Still, it supports clients who choose to cover GLP-1s when combined with lifestyle modification programs. Prime manages pharmacy benefits for about 38 million people and is owned by 19 U.S. Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans.
