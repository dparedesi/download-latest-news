GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy (NVO-0.64%) might help with weight loss, but they aren’t leading to lower health care costs yet, according to a new analysis of U.S. health insurance claims. A review by pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, and reported by Reuters, found that patients with obesity incurred average annual medical costs of $18,507 two years after starting GLP-1 drugs, a 46% increase from before they were on the drugs. For comparison, medical costs for a control group not using GLP-1 drugs rose by 14% over the same period. The analysis found that prescription drug costs were the primary driver of these increases, with other medical expenses also rising during the two years on the drug. It showed no reduction in obesity-related medical events — such as heart attacks, strokes, and type 2 diabetes diagnoses, compared to the control group. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.44%) — the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss — into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know However, many U.S. employers and government insurance programs have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Prime Therapeutics analyzed the pharmacy and medical claims of 3,046 commercially insured patients who received new GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity in 2021, excluding those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Among the GLP-1 users, 46% were taking Wegovy or Ozempic, while others were on Saxenda, Victoza, Rybelsus, or Lilly’s Trulicity. Newer drugs, such as Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, were not included since they launched after study started. The analysis also highlighted adherence challenges. Only 25% of patients who were prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic for weight loss were still taking the medication two years later. This low adherence rate makes it challenging to replicate the results shown in clinical trials, according to Prime Therapeutics VP for pharmacy clinical services David Lassen. “I don’t think it’s fully conclusive at this point,” Lassen told Reuters (TRI+0.90%). He noted that more data and time may be necessary to fully gauge the costs. “We want to do everything possible to help individuals achieve the positive outcomes of being on this medication,” Lassen said. “But if we determine there is not a positive outcome with our data and there is not a return on investment, that will be an inflection point ahead that we will have to consider.” Prime’s assistant VP for health outcomes Patrick Gleason estimated that GLP-1 drugs will cost employers and insurers about $11,200 more per patient over the first two years, despite discounts and rebates. The company said that fewer than 20% of its members have coverage for these weight-loss drugs. Still, it supports clients who choose to cover GLP-1s when combined with lifestyle modification programs. Prime manages pharmacy benefits for about 38 million people and is owned by 19 U.S. Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans.

Title: Nvidia Launches Danish Sovereign AI Supercomputer That Novo Nordisk Will Use

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) plans to use Denmark's first sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer—powered by Nvidia (NVDA) technology—for drug discovery. On Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled "Gefion": a supercomputer named after a goddess in Danish mythology and equipped with 1,528 Nvidia GPUs. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks, Nvidia said. "The era of computer-aided drug discovery must be within this decade," Huang said in a news release. "I’m hoping that what the computer did to the technology industry, it will do for digital biology." The Novo Nordisk Foundation owns the supercomputer, and Novo Nordisk — the company behind popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy— will be among the first to use it. The foundation owns all of Novo Nordisk's Class A shares, which represent about a quarter of the company's capital. Nvidia and Denmark are “inventing something fundamentally new,” with the launch of Gefion, Huang said. “Gefion is going to be a factory of intelligence," Huang said. "This is a new industry that never existed before. It sits on top of the IT industry.” Novo Nordisk, along with the University of Copenhagen and others, are building a “genomic foundation model for discoveries in disease mutation analysis and vaccine design,” by training larger language models on Gefion. Other Gefion pilot projects include a Danish Meteorological Institute effort to deliver faster and more accurate weather forecasts and a University of Copenhagen project to carry out a large-scale simulation of quantum computer circuits.

Title: Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk wants the FDA to stop pharmacies from making off-brand versions of popular weight loss meds

Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.58%) is asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit compounding pharmacies from making off-brand versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes medications. The Danish pharma giant argued in documents submitted to the agency this week that the drug is too complex for pharmacies to make safely and that it belongs in the FDA’s Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists. Drugs included in these lists are off-limits for compounding pharmacies, regardless of a drug’s shortage status. The move comes as both Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly, the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, are trying to curb the sale of off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after for their remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act bans compounding drugs that are just copies of existing medications. However, if a drug is in short supply, it’s not seen as commercially available by the FDA. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs during recent shortages. Novo Nordisk told the FDA that its testing of compounded formulations of semaglutide found impurities that could put patients at risk. An industry group has already come out against those claims. “So Novo Nordisk is apparently so deeply concerned about patient safety that it’s taken them a whopping two-and-a-half years while their drug has been in shortage to conclude that the semaglutide API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] is so demonstrably difficult for compounding pharmacies to prepare that FDA now needs to place it off-limits for compounding?” said Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding CEO Scott Brunner in statement emailed to Quartz. “To me, this looks more like desperation and an attempt by Novo to protect its revenue stream than a serious scientific argument,” Brunner added. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly (LLY+0.43%) quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to any company selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. While compounding is now temporarily allowed, Eli Lilly has shifted its strategy to filing false advertising lawsuits against medical spas and online sellers marketing tirzepatide products.
