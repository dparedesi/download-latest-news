Investing.com -- It was another busy week of market moves. Given earnings season is underway, we can expect it to get even more hectic. Here are Investing.com's stocks of the week: Netflix shares surged on Friday. At the time of writing, it is up more than 9% for the day. The move is, of course, in response to the streaming giant’s latest earnings release, which saw it report Q3 EPS of $5.40, $0.28 better than the analyst estimate of $5.12. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in at $9.82 billion, above the consensus estimate of $9.77 billion. The company added 5.07 million subscribers during its third quarter versus 8.76 million net new subscribers in the year-ago period. However, the figure topped Wall Street estimates, helping send shares higher in early US trading. Furthermore, Netflix’s Q4 EPS guide of $4.23 topped the consensus of $3.90, with revenue expected to be $10.13 billion, above the consensus of $10 billion. Following the earnings release, analysts at Piper Sandler said Netflix stock is set up for “another strong year.” Taiwan Semi was another big mover this week. Early on Thursday, the company reported strong earnings and guidance, which resulted in a more than 9% rise. The company’s shares gained over 7% in the week. The semiconductor firm reported Q3 EPS of $1.94, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $1.79, while revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $23.3 billion. Taiwan Semi sees Q4 2024 revenue between $26.1-26.9 billion, above the consensus of $24.9 billion. Other chip stocks also rose on the back of the company’s earnings. For example, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) tapped a new all-time high in intra-day trading Thursday, with TSM stating in its earnings call that AI demand is “real.” Following the earnings release, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock to NT$1,400 “to reflect TSMC’s stronger 3Q results/4Q guidance, better AI strength, and solid industry leadership.” Nuclear stocks have staged a strong rally in recent weeks. The bullish run began in late September after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a landmark purchase power agreement with Constellation Energy to supply nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. This week, it was announced that Kairos Power and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have signed a Master Plant Development Agreement to create a path to deploy a U.S. fleet of advanced nuclear power projects totaling 500 MW by 2035. Then two days later, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the latest tech giant to buy into nuclear power after revealing it has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects—including enabling the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). One of those agreements with Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. The news surrounding nuclear has resulted in a boost for stocks in the sector. Here are just some of the big nuclear stock movers in the last week: While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:LVMH) shares have managed to regain most of their losses, the stock fell sharply on Wednesday after the luxury group posted a 3% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said its third-quarter sales decline arose primarily “from lower growth seen in Japan, essentially due to the stronger yen.” The company also noted that “Hennessy cognac was held back by weak local demand in the Chinese market.” Despite the headwinds, analysts at Stifel believe an improvement for the company could arrive in H2 2025, driven by stimulus measures in China and a recovery in consumer sentiment. ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) was one semiconductor stock that took a hit this week. On Tuesday, it declined over 15% as its latest earnings release disappointed investors. Following the report, which seemed to be released a day early in error, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the price target to EUR 750 from EUR1,000, removing it as a top pick. The firm did, however, maintain an Overweight rating on ASML. “This Q was obviously a disaster given order weakness and cut to the company’s CY25 outlook,” said the firm. “Near term, we view a likely bottom as €600 (25x new mid-point of 2025 target model) — and with shares at €633, we think the sell-off is mostly done. As for positive catalysts, it will take some time.”

(TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

On Friday, Nomura/Instinet maintained a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (2330:TT) (NYSE: TSM) stock, while increasing the price target to NT$1,400.00 from NT$1,355.00. The revised target comes after TSMC's recent analyst meeting where the company discussed its financial performance and outlook, particularly emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving demand. The semiconductor giant reported a robust gross margin (GM) for the third quarter of 2024, reaching 57.8%, and provided guidance for the fourth quarter GM to be between 57.0% and 59.0%. These figures exceeded market expectations and reinforced the belief that a GM above 55% could become the new standard for TSMC. This is attributed to favorable pricing dynamics and efficiency improvements from the capacity conversion of its advanced N5/3 technologies. TSMC's forecast for fourth-quarter 2024 revenue growth is set at 13% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing both the analyst's prior estimate of 10% and the buy-side consensus of 5-10%. In light of this, Nomura/Instinet has increased its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for TSMC for the years 2024 to 2026 by 2-3%. The price target adjustment is based on a 24x multiple of the forecasted 2025 EPS, which remains unchanged. The analyst underscored that TSMC's stock presents an attractive value at 18x/19x NMR/BBG 2025F EPS, noting it is trading at roughly a 20% discount compared to the SOX P/E ratio. The optimism is further bolstered by TSMC's guidance, which suggests that the impact of new overseas fabs on GM will be managed effectively, with only a 2-3 percentage point dilution expected in 2025. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been the subject of positive analyst attention following strong third-quarter results. Both BofA Securities and UBS have raised their price targets for TSMC, with BofA setting it at NT$1,400 and UBS at NT$1,300, while maintaining their respective buy ratings. The upward revisions come after TSMC reported a third-quarter earnings per share of NT$12.54, surpassing market expectations by 8%. TSMC's third-quarter gross margin also made headlines, reaching 57.8%, higher than the company's guided range of 53.5-55.5%. This increase was attributed to higher utilization rates and cost improvements, particularly due to advancements in the 5/3 nanometer technologies. Additionally, TSMC has projected a gross margin expansion to 57.0-59.0% in the fourth quarter of 2024, exceeding previous expectations. Both BofA Securities and UBS are optimistic about TSMC's future, citing the company's leadership in the semiconductor industry and potential for continued growth. UBS projects TSMC's gross margin to further increase to 58.5% in 2025, considering factors such as a price increase on N5/3 technologies, improved utilization, and a decrease in N3 dilution. Moreover, TSMC reported a 12.8% sequential revenue increase to NT$23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by strong demand for 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies in smartphones and AI applications. The company also anticipates Q4 2024 revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion. These recent developments underline TSMC's robust financial performance and promising growth trajectory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with Nomura/Instinet's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth remains robust, with a 22.65% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. This growth is even more pronounced on a quarterly basis, with Q3 2024 showing an impressive 38.95% revenue growth. The company's profitability metrics are equally compelling. TSM boasts a gross profit margin of 54.45% and an operating income margin of 42.04% for the last twelve months, reflecting its operational efficiency and pricing power in the semiconductor market. These figures support the analyst's view on TSMC's ability to maintain high gross margins. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a 42.34% dividend growth over the last twelve months. This, coupled with a current dividend yield of 0.95%, underscores the company's commitment to shareholder returns amid its growth trajectory. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of TSM's potential, InvestingPro offers 16 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: TSMC Says It Will Take “Prompt Action” If Found In Violation of Huawei Sanctions

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has assured that it is committed to complying with all regulations that prohibit it from selling chips to and having business dealings with Chinese technology giant Huawei. Huawei is forbidden by US law to acquire high end chips that are manufactured using US origin technologies, and TSMC's comments came in response to a report that claimed that the firm was being investigated by the US for having ties to Huawei. The purported investigation is being headed by the Commerce Department, and it covers TSMC's artificial intelligence and smartphone chips. TSMC's statement comes after a paywalled report in The Information which had claimed that the Commerce Department was investigating TSMC for having supplied Huawei with chips used in either smartphones or artificial intelligence systems. Huawei's smartphone chips have been heavily scrutinized since US sanctions in 2020 stopped TSMC from selling the most advanced products to the company. For instance, TSMC cannot sell chips made through 7 nanometer or lower process technology nodes to Huawei, and with Huawei's competitors such as Apple now using 3 nanometer chips in their smartphones, the restrictions have dealt a sizable competitive blow to the firm due to its work with the Chinese government. The rise of AI has further increased the scrutiny of advanced processor shipments worldwide. These have led to NVIDIA facing US restrictions for selling some products to Huawei, and they have also increased China's efforts to develop its local AI ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western technology. In response, TSMC has stressed that it "is a law abiding company," adding that "we are committed to complying with all applicable regulations." TSMC states that if is has "any reason to believe there are issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance." With the surging demand for AI processors helping TSMC to recover from a slump in the consumer electronics industry, any violations of US law could create complications for the global semiconductor industry. Since TSMC supplies most of the chips made on order worldwide, legal and regulatory complications might restrict its access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment. This in turn could force firms to diversify their chip manufacturing supply chains. TSMC's sizable presence in Taiwan and the region's geopolitical tussles with China have also created unease in chip companies about the threat of supply chain disruption in case of conflict in the South China Sea. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang remarked last month that his firm's chip design capabilities allow it to shift away from TSMC in the worst case scenario since NVIDIA designs "diversity and redundancy into every aspect wherever we can. And then the last part of it, is, to have enough intellectual property in our company in the event that we have to shift from one fab to another, we have the ability to do it." TAIWAN SEMI $TSM RESPONSE: “TSMC IS A LAW-ABIDING COMPANY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IF WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE ISSUES, WE WILL TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.” https://t.co/H3oGDj0D6w — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 18, 2024 Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed as earnings results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) helped revitalize optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and September retail sales data came in ahead of forecasts. After trading higher for most of the session and posting an all-time intraday high, the S&P 500 lost steam in the afternoon to close the session less than 0.1% lower. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal gain of less than 0.1%, while the Dow added 0.4% to print its second straight record close. Health insurer shares moved lower after industry player Elevance Health (ELV) missed profit estimates with its third-quarter results and lowered its guidance for the full year. The company attributed the shortfall to declines in Medicaid enrollments stemming from eligibility redeterminations and other changes. Elevance shares dropped 10.6%, while losses spread to other health insurance stocks with Medicaid exposure. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) plunged 12.6%, the steepest drop in the S&P 500, while Centene (CNC) stock lost 9.1%. CSX (CSX) shares tumbled 6.7% after the freight shipper's quarterly sales and profits fell short of analysts' expectations. Hurricanes Helene and Milton weighed on the company's results, while a decline in coal revenue and lower fuel charges also restrained revenues. Shares of Snap-On (SNA), a provider of tools and equipment for professional users across various industries, soared 10.0% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500. The gains came after Snap-On released its third-quarter financial results, matching analysts' revenue forecasts but exceeding earnings per share (EPS) expectations. In its largest segment, which sells tools and services to auto repair shops, Snap-On posted 4% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, suggesting a potential turnaround in that key market. The Travelers Companies (TRV) shares surged 9.0% following the insurer's third-quarter earnings report. Despite a year-over-year uptick in catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Helene and other severe weather events, Travelers more than tripled its net income compared with the year-ago period, boosted by higher premiums and increased investment income. The company also reported an improvement in its consolidated combined ratio—a key gauge of profitability for insurance companies. Investment management firm Blackstone (BX) reported better-than-expected profits alongside an increase in assets under management for the third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.3%. Blackstone's CEO noted that the firm invested or committed more than $54 billion during the quarter—the highest amount in more than two years. Blackstone's overall fund appreciation during the quarter also reached its strongest level in three years.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-0.60%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-1.85%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.85%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL-0.73%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-3.15%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-0.60%), Micron Technology (MU-1.65%), and Broadcom (AVGO-0.29%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.85%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.85%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE-0.78%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER+0.05%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet. The Financial Times on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the process, reports that Uber has met with advisors in recent months after a third party brought up the idea. A focus of those discussions, which the Times says are still at a very early stage, was Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber 2017. — Rocio Fabbro and William Gavin contributed to this article.

On Thursday, JPMorgan reaffirmed its Overweight rating on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), following the company's third-quarter earnings report, which surpassed expectations. The semiconductor giant reported gross margins (GM) of 57.8%, significantly higher than the anticipated mid-point guidance of 54.5% and JPMorgan's estimate of 54.8%. Moreover, TSMC provided an optimistic fourth-quarter revenue growth forecast of 13% quarter over quarter, indicating a potential further increase in gross margins. The improvement in gross margins for the second half of 2024 is attributed to better utilization rates, with N5 and N3 technology nodes operating at full capacity, and productivity gains. These positive factors have helped mitigate the challenges posed by the transition from N5 to N3 technology and increases in power tariffs. TSMC also projects that the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) will sustain for several years, driven by robust demand from hyperscaler customers and the development of practical applications. This outlook suggests the likelihood of an ongoing semiconductor industry upcycle. JPMorgan's analysis points to a potential near-term rise in TSMC's stock value, particularly in light of the company's strong guidance and margin trajectory. This outlook comes as a reassurance to investors, especially after recent concerns about potential weaknesses in the semiconductor sector following disappointing news from ASML (AS:ASML). In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) reported robust third-quarter sales, surpassing both their own and market estimates. This success is attributed to the strong performance of TSMC's advanced nodes, particularly as the 3nm technology continues to gain traction. HSBC, BofA Securities, and Bernstein SocGen Group have all maintained positive ratings on TSMC, highlighting the company's strong financial performance and future potential. TSMC's revenue reached TWD760 billion, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.85%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.85%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” said Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Huang had previously said that the company expected smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. Looking ahead, TSMC chief C.C. Wei has said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. Wedbush analysts say the company could keep riding this high for a long while. In a note Thursday titled “No End in Sight to AI Derived Strength,” analysts, led by Matt Bryson, said the third-quarter results give more confidence to views that TSMC will be able to continue growing gross margins. TSMC’s gross margins were 58% for the quarter. The analysts expect AI chip revenues to more than triple in 2024 and account for around a mid-teens percentage of TSMC’s revenues. For the fourth quarter, TSMC estimates that its revenue will come in between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion — a multi-billion dollar increase from last quarter. It’s projecting gross profit margin of 57.0% to 59.0%, consistent with the third quarter or slightly higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker rode demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology to record third-quarter profits; Expedia (EXPE) shares are taking off after a report that Uber (UBER) was considering a takeover bid; Netflix (NFLX) is expected to grow its profit and add new subscribers in its third-quarter earnings report after markets close; shares of CSX (CSX) are falling after the railroad operator said it expects to see a drop in fourth-quarter sales on hurricane disruptions and lower coal demand; and United Airlines (UAL) shares are in focus after jumping 12% yesterday. Here's what investors need to know today. Fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported record net income of 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion) for the third quarter, a 54% year-over-year increase. TSMC's revenue also hit a record, jumping 39% to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion). Both surpassed consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. U.S-listed shares of TSMC are surging 9% in premarket trading and shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are all up at least 3%. Shares of online travel company Expedia (EXPE) are jumping 6% in premarket trading after a report that Uber Technologies (UBER) has considered a takeover bid. The Financial Times said that Uber executives "approached advisers in recent months" about a potential takeover bid of Expedia, and that "there are no current discussions." Shares of Uber are sliding by about 3%. Netflix (NFLX) shares are edging higher in premarket trading as investors anticipate the after-the-bell release of the streaming giant's third-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project Netflix will report a 33% year-over-year jump in net income to $2.24 billion, while its expected revenue of $9.77 billion would be a 14% improvement. Investors also will be watching for Netflix's subscriber totals, which are expected to increase by 4 million from the prior quarter and over 30 million more than last year to reach 282 million. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) warned that its operations would be impacted by the damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton that hit the Southeast recently, and that low fuel prices and sagging demand for coal could lead to a $200 million fourth-quarter hit. For the third quarter, CSX reported earnings per share (EPS) of 46 cents on revenue of $3.62 billion, below analysts' estimates of 48 cents on revenue of $3.68 billion. Its shares are about 5% lower in premarket trading. Investors are watching United Airlines (UAL) after its shares reached their highest levels in more than four years Wednesday. United stock jumped more than 12% in the prior session after it announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, its first since the pandemic, and it reported quarterly earnings above estimates. United Airline shares are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: U.S. chip stocks rally as TSMC's AI-backed outlook impresses investors

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.
