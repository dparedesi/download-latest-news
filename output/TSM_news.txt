Stock futures are little changed this morning after the major indexes posted big gains to start the week; Nvidia and AMD each showcased new AI-focused products in their respective events at CES on Monday; oil stocks are rising further after leading Monday's rally on hopes that they will benefit from new leadership in Venezuela; Gold and silver are once again approaching record highs amid the geopolitical uncertainty; and high demand for hardware to run AI models continues to boost Micron and other chipmakers. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are mixed Tuesday after the major indexes each gained on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average setting new intraday and closing records. Dow futures were down 0.1% recently, while futures linked to the S&P 500 were hovering near unchanged and Nasdaq futures added 0.2%. WTI crude oil futures were up 0.5% at $58.60 per barrel, trading at their highest levels in a month, as market participants try to gauge the impact of developments in oil-rich Venezuela. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,475 an ounce, while bitcoin was at $93,800, down slightly from yesterday afternoon but still near its highest levels in more than a month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, rose to 4.18% from 4.16% at Monday's close. Investors have a slew of AI updates to digest, after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su each spoke at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. Huang showcased Nvidia's new Rubin chips that will go on sale later this year, focusing on applications in the real world like robotics and self-driving cars. AMD also revealed its newest chips, for use in products like personal computers and servers, as well as physical AI applications like robotics. Shares of Nvidia and AMD, which fell on Monday ahead of the presentations, were up less than 1% in premarket trading. Oil stocks are extending gains this morning after leading the market's rally Monday. Oil and gas companies got a boost from news over the weekend that the U.S. had captured Nicolás Maduro, the president of oil-rich Venezuela. President Donald Trump has said that the U.S. will encourage its oil companies to invest in Venezuela to "fix" its crumbling oil infrastructure and increase oil production. Shares of Chevron (CVX), the only U.S. company that currently has a presence in Venezuela, were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading after leading the Dow with a 5% jump Monday. Oil majors ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), as well as oilfield services companies Baker Hughes (BKR) and SLB (SLB), were also higher this morning after posting solid gains yesterday. The uncertainty created by the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela has also sparked a rally for precious metals as some investors turn to safe-haven assets. Gold futures were up 0.5% recently at $4,475 an ounce, moving toward the record high of around $4,580 set on Dec, 26. Silver futures were up nearly 2% this morning at $78.15 an ounce, approaching the all-time high of about $83 set late last month. Investors frequently turn to gold and other precious metals as stores of value during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals set a number of record highs last year—the price of gold rose 65% in 2025—amid stock market volatility, concerns over tariffs, a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Shares of Micron Technology (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Intel (INTC) are each gaining Tuesday morning as the hardware portion of the AI trade continues to be strong. Micron shares soared some 240% in 2025 as its revenue surged due to high demand for the memory components it sells to other chipmakers such as Nvidia. The demand for hardware to run AI models has also created a shortage in the memory market, driving prices to record highs and further boosting Micron's revenue in recent quarters. Counterpoint Research has forecast that memory prices could rise another 40% through the second quarter of this year, a potential further boon for companies like Micron that could also lead to higher prices for smartphones and computer hardware.
