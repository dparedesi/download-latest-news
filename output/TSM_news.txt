Title: Step Into The Shadows And Take A Peek At My Purloined Portfolio

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Do you keep an eye on your competition? Of course you do. Competition research is common sense. When you think a competitor has a great idea, adopt it or adapt it. In that spirit, once a year I compile a Purloined Portfolio, consisting of one stock from each of five rival investment managers I respect. Here goes. I’ve always been a fan of Scott Black, who heads Delphi Management in Boston. Black is a major art collector and Democratic Party donor. He is featured in Barron’s magazine each year on its stock-picking panel. From his holdings, I select Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B). Berkshire has been run for six decades by investment legend Warren Buffett, who plans to relinquish the helm at the end of this year. I think he has a good team in place, led by Greg Abel, who will be the next CEO. I regard Berkshire as the country’s most successful conglomerate. I don’t advocate breaking it up, but if Abel needed or wanted to sell off some of the pieces, I think he could reap high valuations for many of them. Randall Eley runs pension-fund money and the Edgar Lomax Value Fund (LOMAX) in Alexandria, Virginia. His largest holding is CVS Health Corp. (CVS). You might be surprised by this choice, since the stock has lost 24% of its value over the past decade. I think CVS is poised for a comeback. One of its competitors, Rite Aid, has declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Its largest competitor, Walgreens, seems to me to have lost some of its mojo. CVS is considering selling or splitting off Caremark (a pharmacy benefits manager) and Aetna (a health insurer). I’m in favor of such a move. I believe that pharmacy benefits management has build-in conflicts of interest. As for health insurance, I think it’s a difficult business because of rising health-care costs. The core drugstore business is the one that most appeals to me. A veteran international stock picker, Benard (Bernie) Horn runs the Polaris Global Value Fund. From his holdings I draw Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG). It’s the largest bank in Japan, and also owns approximately 23% of Morgan Stanley, a big investment bank in the U.S. In the past four quarters, Mitsubishi UFJ has seen profits climb 29%, on a 10% increase in revenue. Most analysts expect growth to slow down. Should you buy it? Analytical opinion is split, but I think the present valuation (14 times recent earnings and 1.3 times book value) leaves room for more gains. Matrix Asset Advisors in New York City manages a little over $1 billion, with David Katz as chief investment officer. One of the stocks he owns is L3 Harris Technologies Inc. (LHX), a defense contractor that specializes in military electronics. I think that ISR – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance – is already vital to national defense, and will become even more so. That why I like L3 Harris even though it’s more expensive than I normally go for. The stock trades at 33 times recent earnings and 24 times estimated earnings. The Buffalo International Fund, run by Nicole Kornitzer, is up more than 16% this year through October 10. From Kornitzer’s holdings, I choose the same stock I did last year, Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co. (TSM). In the past year, it’s up 47%. It might seem crazy to hope for more, but I do. Every major semiconductor company I know, except Intel Corp. (INTC), uses TSM to manufacture its chips. Thus, TSM is at the very heart of the global economy. Of course, there is geopolitical risk: An invasion of Taiwan by China is a real threat. In the past year (October 14, 2024 through October 10, 2025) my Purloined Portfolio returned 20.1%, including dividends. That handily beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index, which returned 13.3%. Leading the charge was Taiwan Semiconductor’s 47% return. Also doing well was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), drawn from David Katz’s holdings. My worst selection was Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), which declined 27%. The long-term results are also favorable. In 21 years, my Purloined Portfolios have averaged 13.2%, while the S&P 500 has averaged 11.6%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Of the 21 stolen-idea lists, 17 have been profitable and 11 have beaten the S&P. Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFG and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston. His firm of clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com.

Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.
