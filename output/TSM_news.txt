The Trump administration’s large-scale layoffs of federal workers could affect the rollout of former President Joe Biden’s efforts to bring advanced chipmaking back to the U.S. The Chips Program Office, which oversees the implementation of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, is set to lose two-fifths of its workforce, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people. About 20 employees have left after accepting deferred resignations, according to Bloomberg, and about 40 probationary workers are bracing for layoffs on Monday. The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. The terminations won’t have a big effect on employees negotiating contracts with companies receiving funding, one person told Bloomberg. These employees are responsible for tracking progress on contractual benchmarks. Leaders in the Chips Program Office met Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to discourage him from laying off those employees, Bloomberg reported. Other Chips Act funding projects may be at risk due to federal cuts, including $500 million in funding for smaller companies involved in the semiconductor supply chain. Lutnick has asked the office’s employees how it’s making funding decisions, and how the government could get money back that has been awarded, according to Bloomberg. He’s also interested in limiting how companies who have received Chips Act funding can conduct business in China, the news service said. Employees are looking at ways to amend applications for funding and contract language that could meet the Trump administration’s demands, Bloomberg said. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-3.86%) (TSMC), a recipient of Chips Act funding, announced it’s planning to invest at least $100 billion to build out chip plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of jobs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is investing billions of dollars to boost chip manufacturing in the U.S. The Taiwanese chipmaker plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out plants in the U.S. over the next four years, the Trump administration announced on Monday. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC (TSM-3.86%) is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump said during a briefing. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of high-paying jobs. “The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” Trump said. “It will be a big percentage of the chips made by this company.” The announcement brings TSMC’s total U.S. investment to $165 billion. “This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy and, really, without the semiconductors there is no economy.” Trump said the U.S. “must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor.” “We are going to produce many AI chips,” TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said during the announcement. “We are going to produce many tools to support the AI progress and to support the smartphone progress.” In October, Bloomberg reported that the chipmaker’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — are about four percentage points higher at its Phoenix, Arizona site than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan. The company’s first major U.S. hub includes two chipmaking facilities expected to begin production this year and in 2028. Meanwhile, TSMC was awarded up to $6.6 billion in direct funding under the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act in November. Some of the funding — which will go toward its Phoenix hub — will be used to build a third fab, the Biden administration said, adding that it will put the U.S. on track to produce 20% of the world’s advanced chips by 2030. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple — one of its major customers — at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said, adding that TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year.

Nvidia (NVDA-5.46%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-6.04%), and Dell (DELL-3.96%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC+0.02%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO-5.74%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM-3.86%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC+0.02%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA-5.46%) and Broadcom (AVGO-5.74%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-3.10%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT-1.04%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-3.86%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.
