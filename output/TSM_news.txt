By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 8 based on their upside potential, as of November 18, 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Analyst Upside as of November 18, 2024: 29% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks that could 10x over the next three years. The semiconductor company makes chips for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. TSM attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its presence across the world. The company recently formed a joint venture with major partners in Germany and expanded its partnership with Amkor to facilitate advanced packaging in Arizona, fueling the semiconductor ecosystem in the region. In addition to that, the company expects to spend $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, allocated to advanced process technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and testing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) expects revenue from AI chips to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall TSM ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Nvidia is having problems with its hot new AI chip as earning loom

After facing delays for its new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia (NVDA-3.26%) reportedly has a new problem — one that has its customers worried. The Information, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Nvidia has repeatedly asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected. Nvidia’s customers are reportedly worried about a delay for the server racks, which combine 72 of the AI chips in hope that larger AI models can be trained faster with more chips. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reports, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. On Sunday, Dell (DELL+2.83%) chief executive Michael Dell posted on X that Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks are shipping, and that Dell had delivered server racks to CoreWeave. “NVIDIA GB200 systems are the most advanced computers ever created. Integrating them into a diverse range of data center environments requires co-engineering with our customers,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While our customers race to be first to market, NVIDIA is working with leading CSPs as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.” Nvidia’s production and shipping delays for Blackwell were also caused by a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, Huang said. The chipmaker had to work with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.55%), to resolve the engineering setback. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Nvidia is set to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.31%). Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia stock was down by about 2.5% during Monday morning trading, but the shares are up about 187% so far this year.

Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA-3.10%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company’s shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results, the company’s shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. “The market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,” Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said “Nvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,” and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple’s (AAPL+0.48%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.36%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia’s technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.35%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell’s production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL-1.84%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%).
