An advanced chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was reportedly found in sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei’s latest artificial intelligence chips. Research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s cutting-edge AI accelerator and found an Ascend 910B chip made by TSMC (TSM+1.13%), Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Canadian research firm told TSMC about its findings, prompting the Taiwanese chipmaker to inform the U.S. government about Huawei’s possible violation of U.S. export controls, Reuters reported. The Chinese tech company said it hasn’t “produced any chips via TSMC after the implementation of the amendments made by the US Department of Commerce to its FDPR that target Huawei in 2020,” in a statement shared with Bloomberg. The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. Huawei added that it “has never launched the 910B chip.” TSMC also informed the U.S. government about a potential attempt by Huawei to have it make AI chips for the company, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker said in a statement shared with Quartz that it “proactively communicated with the U.S. commerce department regarding” a report by The Information last week that it was under investigation for making AI or smartphone chips for Huawei, which would be a violation of U.S. export controls. “We are not aware of TSMC being the subject of any investigation at this time,” TSMC said in the statement, adding that it “is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The chipmaker said it has not supplied chips to Huawei “since mid-September 2020.” “If we have any reason to believe there are potential issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance, including conducting investigations and proactively communicating with relevant parties including customers and regulatory authorities,” TSMC said in the statement. Neither Huawei nor the Department of Commerce responded to a request for comment from Quartz. TSMC informed the Commerce Department about a customer placing orders for a chip resembling the Ascend 910B processor developed by Huawei, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. After seeing the order, a person close to TSMC told the Financial Times that the company also spoke to the customer related to the order, and that any investigation would be “related to” the Taiwanese chipmaker, but that it wouldn’t be the focus. The chipmaker reportedly made the precursor to Huawei’s chip before U.S. sanctions were placed on the Chinese tech company. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Financial Times that its Bureau of Industry and Security is aware of The Information’s report, and that it “cannot comment on whether any investigation is ongoing.” Officials from the BIS met with TSMC leaders earlier this month about issues with its supply chain, Bloomberg reported, including over if third-party distributors could allow China access to restricted technology. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 1.5% during mid-day trading on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional information and a statement from TSMC.

Nvidia (NVDA-2.84%) closed at a record high Monday as Wall Street anticipates Big Tech’s earnings report in November. The chipmaker’s stock rose 4.14% and closed at $143.71 per share, and its shares continued climbing in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, the company’s stock reached an intraday record high of $142.46, according to Barron’s. Nvidia’s shares are up 198.34% so far this year. Friday, Bank of America (BAC+0.09%) raised its price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165, citing “confidence in NVDA’s competitive lead and generational opportunity.” Research analyst Vivek Arya cited “recent industry events,” including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) (TSM+1.13%) earnings results and Advanced Micro Devices’ AI event, as part of the reason for the price target lift in the Bank of America Global Research report last week. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,” Arya said. Last week, Nvidia set an intraday high after TSMC beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock briefly climbed over 3% to set an intraday record of $140.89 per share Thursday. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Meanwhile, TSMC reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell over 4% last Tuesday after closing at a record high $138.07 the previous day. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries.

Investing.com -- It was another busy week of market moves. Given earnings season is underway, we can expect it to get even more hectic. Here are Investing.com's stocks of the week: Netflix shares surged on Friday. At the time of writing, it is up more than 9% for the day. The move is, of course, in response to the streaming giant’s latest earnings release, which saw it report Q3 EPS of $5.40, $0.28 better than the analyst estimate of $5.12. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in at $9.82 billion, above the consensus estimate of $9.77 billion. The company added 5.07 million subscribers during its third quarter versus 8.76 million net new subscribers in the year-ago period. However, the figure topped Wall Street estimates, helping send shares higher in early US trading. Furthermore, Netflix’s Q4 EPS guide of $4.23 topped the consensus of $3.90, with revenue expected to be $10.13 billion, above the consensus of $10 billion. Following the earnings release, analysts at Piper Sandler said Netflix stock is set up for “another strong year.” Taiwan Semi was another big mover this week. Early on Thursday, the company reported strong earnings and guidance, which resulted in a more than 9% rise. The company’s shares gained over 7% in the week. The semiconductor firm reported Q3 EPS of $1.94, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $1.79, while revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $23.3 billion. Taiwan Semi sees Q4 2024 revenue between $26.1-26.9 billion, above the consensus of $24.9 billion. Other chip stocks also rose on the back of the company’s earnings. For example, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) tapped a new all-time high in intra-day trading Thursday, with TSM stating in its earnings call that AI demand is “real.” Following the earnings release, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock to NT$1,400 “to reflect TSMC’s stronger 3Q results/4Q guidance, better AI strength, and solid industry leadership.” Nuclear stocks have staged a strong rally in recent weeks. The bullish run began in late September after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a landmark purchase power agreement with Constellation Energy to supply nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. This week, it was announced that Kairos Power and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have signed a Master Plant Development Agreement to create a path to deploy a U.S. fleet of advanced nuclear power projects totaling 500 MW by 2035. Then two days later, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the latest tech giant to buy into nuclear power after revealing it has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects—including enabling the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). One of those agreements with Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. The news surrounding nuclear has resulted in a boost for stocks in the sector. Here are just some of the big nuclear stock movers in the last week: While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:LVMH) shares have managed to regain most of their losses, the stock fell sharply on Wednesday after the luxury group posted a 3% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said its third-quarter sales decline arose primarily “from lower growth seen in Japan, essentially due to the stronger yen.” The company also noted that “Hennessy cognac was held back by weak local demand in the Chinese market.” Despite the headwinds, analysts at Stifel believe an improvement for the company could arrive in H2 2025, driven by stimulus measures in China and a recovery in consumer sentiment. ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) was one semiconductor stock that took a hit this week. On Tuesday, it declined over 15% as its latest earnings release disappointed investors. Following the report, which seemed to be released a day early in error, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the price target to EUR 750 from EUR1,000, removing it as a top pick. The firm did, however, maintain an Overweight rating on ASML. “This Q was obviously a disaster given order weakness and cut to the company’s CY25 outlook,” said the firm. “Near term, we view a likely bottom as €600 (25x new mid-point of 2025 target model) — and with shares at €633, we think the sell-off is mostly done. As for positive catalysts, it will take some time.”
