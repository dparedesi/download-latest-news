ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Taiwan Semiconductor is a major player in the global chip trade. And the one-year-old fund TSMY is trading derivatives on TSM stock to produce eye-popping dividends. Does one of these securities deserve a place in your portfolio? Let's find out. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited is the world’s largest dedicated chip foundry, which has a global market share of nearly 65%. The company manufactures semiconductors under contract for clients, including the world's largest tech companies. TSM is the ticker for Taiwan Semiconductor's ADR. An ADR or American depository receipt is a U.S.-traded stock that represents a foreign company's equity. ADRs generally have the same rights as the original stock. If the TSM ADR were not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, interested investors could only buy equity in the company by purchasing ticker 2330 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. TSMY is an actively managed ETF by YieldMax ETFs. TSMY buys and sells options on TSM stock to produce income and realize limited gains when TSM stock appreciates. The fund does not invest in TSM or 2330 stock directly. Options give the holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a security at a certain price within a specified timeframe. TSMY's options strategy is complex. It involves selling call options without owning the underlying security. Instead of owning TSM directly, the fund uses other financial contracts to replicate TSM price movements. Additionally, the fund uses U.S. Treasury securities for collateral and additional income. TSM and TSMY are fundamentally different assets. The table below highlights some key differences. TSM stock represents a direct equity position in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor. When you own the stock, you own a slice of the company—including future profits and dividends. Owning TSMY provides no ownership position in TSM or any right to TSM dividends. Instead, the fund provides indirect TSM exposure through options contracts. These contracts are designed to provide income and create limited gains when TSM stock appreciates. TSM comes with the usual risks of stock ownership. Your position can lose value or stop producing dividend income without warning. This stock has a beta of 1.2, meaning it is 20% more volatile than the overall market. TSMY has the same risks, but with an added dimension of complexity. Options trading is inherently risky because it creates leverage—meaning you can participate in a stock’s price changes with less capital than what's required to own the stock directly. With leverage, you can lose or gain more than you've invested. TSMY manages the risk with layers of options to isolate its exposure. One outcome is that larger gains from TSM may not fully flow through to the fund. More specifically, if the stock appreciates enough, the fund will have losses on its short positions that limit the upside for shareholders. TSM stock has gained 43.7% over the past year. Including the modest dividend yield of 0.9%, the total return was 45%. TSM has also appreciated 213.4% over the past five years. TSMY was launched in August 2024. Since inception, the share price has declined 27.2% or $5.87. The fund has paid $8.27 in dividends, however. That nets to a total return of about 11.1%. TSM’s current P/E ratio is 28.15, which is down from its 2024 P/E of 31.16 and higher than its five-year average of 22.64. All three values compare favorably to the average industry P/E of 55.72, which considers 67 stocks in the semiconductor space. Note that TSM manufactures chips, while other semiconductor companies like Nvidia outsource this function, often to TSM. The foundry business is more capital-intensive, and therefore riskier, than fabless chip design—so their P/E ratios aren’t wholly comparable. TSMY's net asset value per share is $15.89, and its share price is $15.77. In other words, the fund trades at a slight discount to the value of its assets. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is prone to double-digit swings in short timeframes. For example, between January and March of 2025, TSM stock fell 17.4%. And since the end of March, the stock has gained 37.6%. The volatility is a function of several factors, including global chip demand, high-speed computing trends, supply chain factors and evolving global trade policies. Global chip demand directly affects TSM, since it is the dominant market-share leader in semiconductors. Projections for the industry in 2025 and beyond continue to be optimistic. Deloitte predicted $697 billion in global chip sales this year, with the potential for $1 trillion by 2030. AI is the most talked-about driver of global chip demand because the world's largest tech companies are racing to build out their high-performance computing power. But semiconductors are an integral part of several high-profile industries, including 5G communications, autonomous driving, fintech, cybersecurity, cryptocurrency, healthcare and manufacturing. While the pace of the AI buildout could slow, ongoing demand from other industries will continue. The semiconductor supply chain involves chip foundries, chip designers and providers of machinery, tooling, test equipment and raw materials. These players are located all over the world, so there is also a heavy logistics component in this space. Meeting the increasing demand for semiconductors requires efficient collaboration throughout the supply chain. Historically, supply chain issues have been disruptive. For example, pandemic-related supply problems prompted a global chip shortage in 2020. The outlook on the semiconductor value chain remains mixed. In 2024, Boston Consulting Group reported on increased resilience fueled by pro-innovation policies in several countries and geographic diversification. More recently, Graham Scott, vice president of global procurement at Jabil, had a less positive view—noting the potential for "significant disruptions to the global supply chain." U.S. President Donald Trump is currently reshaping global trade with an aggressive tariff agenda. How the new levy structure will affect the complex semiconductor supply chain is still unknown. Issues to watch include the new 50% tariff on copper and U.S.-China trade negotiations. Copper is used extensively in chip fabrication. And China supplies 95% of gallium and germanium, two raw materials necessary for certain semiconductors, according to McKinsey. Four covering analysts currently rate TSM a buy. The consensus price target is $258.33, which implies almost 7% upside from the current price of $241.47. Since June 1, analysts from Susquehanna and Barclays have raised their TSM price targets. Morningstar, the leading provider of fund ratings, does not cover or rate TSMY. However, Morningstar rates TSMY's parent, YieldMax ETFs, as below average. The rating commentary notes, "YieldMax ETFs has not been able to demonstrate that it has a unique value proposition over other asset managers." If your strategy involves increasing your semiconductor exposure, opt for TSM. It provides direct semiconductor exposure in a familiar equity package. If you're interested in growing your income portfolio, there are many other income funds with more diversification and less risk than TSMY. TSMY's distribution yield is impressive, but that yield is less meaningful when it accompanies a per-share price decline. TSMY's net result so far has been a good, but not great, total return. Bottom Line TSM is a top semiconductor stock, and TSMY is an options fund that doesn't directly own equity in TSM or any other company. Unless you have a spot in your portfolio earmarked for income-producing derivatives, TSMY is likely too risky. TSM, on the other hand, may fit in your holdings if you can accept the risks and volatility of the semiconductor space. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. What Are The Main Differences Between TSM And TSMY ? TSM is a stock that provides an equity position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMY is an actively managed ETF that writes and sells call options on TSM stock to produce income, without investing TSM stock directly. Do Both TSM And TSMY Pay Dividends? Both TSM and TSMY pay dividends. Shareholder payouts from TSM are standard quarterly dividends, paid from excess cash flow. TSMY payouts are monthly and include option income. Can I Hold Both TSM And TSMY In My Portfolio? You can hold TSM and TSMY simultaneously. Holding both may create a concentration risk, depending on what else is in your portfolio.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: OpenAI’s ecosystem play, Nvidia’s open-source question and the race for AI dominance

UPDATED 14:01 EDT / AUGUST 11 2025 by Chad Wilson The OpenAI ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, redefining how frontier artificial intelligence models are deployed, monetized and integrated into enterprise workflows. With moves that widen its partnerships beyond long-standing alliances, OpenAI Inc. is positioning itself for a new era of scale, developer adoption and competitive resilience. In this week’s episode of theCUBE Pod, John Furrier (pictured, left), executive analyst at theCUBE Research, and Dave Vellante (right), chief analyst at theCUBE Research, talk about how industry watchers are tracking a confluence of strategic shifts: horizontal expansion into multiple cloud environments, fresh licensing approaches through open weights and the unveiling of GPT-5 with improved coding capabilities. These developments OpenAI ecosystem come amid rising speculation about an IPO and a potential recalibration of the company’s relationship with Microsoft Corp. “This is a huge deal because it’s the open-source license. There’s a story hiding in plain sight that no one’s talking about,” Furrier said. “I think the signaling that I’m reading between the tea leaves is OpenAI is losing the relationship; there’s a breakup coming with Microsoft’s. Clearly decoupling going on.” OpenAI’s decision to launch on Amazon Web Services Inc., with models running from day one, marks a notable broadening of its cloud presence. This strategic alignment not only grants AWS a new AI asset in its portfolio but also gives OpenAI access to thousands of enterprise customers beyond Microsoft Azure. The company’s simultaneous move to make open-weight models available could further entice developers seeking to customize AI for their specific verticals, opening up the OpenAI ecosystem even more according to Vellante. “I was on the Nvidia analyst call. The big question is what’s OpenAI’s commitment to open source,” he said. “It’s not only open source, it’s open weights. To me, that’s the more interesting piece of this because if it’s open weights, then enterprises can customize it for their own needs, but it’s a GPT-3 class model. It’s now two generations behind the state-of-the-art because today GPT-5 came out.” The launch of GPT-5 underscores how quickly the competitive landscape is evolving. OpenAI’s latest model delivers notable improvements in reasoning, accuracy and code generation — areas critical to AI’s next adoption wave. Paired with a multicloud strategy, these product advances hint at an intentional decoupling from Microsoft in favor of a more balanced partner portfolio, Furrier explained. “OpenAI clearly is playing an ecosystem play,” he said. “If you look at the narratives … it is absolutely a go-to-market ecosystem move by OpenAI. they are clearly going horizontal in the execution. That is a direct counter to a relationship with Microsoft that is a decoupling hedge or intentional plan to expand the base.” Beyond the OpenAI ecosystem narrative, the discussion also touched on other significant developments shaping tech and business strategy. From policy-driven shifts in crypto markets to legacy chipmakers facing innovation pressure, theCUBE’s coverage continues to link macro trends with on-the-ground insight from key venues. At events such as Black Hat, AI security implications remain top of mind. Meanwhile, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, conversations in the “NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers” series are bringing together founders, investors and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets — especially as the GENIUS Act introduces clearer regulations for stablecoins and institutional adoption accelerates, according to Furrier. “This is going to bring in Fidelity, it’s going to bring in all the top people,” he said. “You can now back stable coins with payments. All the deposit institutions, federal agencies, the regulatory antiquated system has been the bottleneck in crypto. GENIUS Act is one, the AI stuff that they’re doing, these are policy things that they’re grinding out and people don’t appreciate this.” Chip industry challenges were also spotlighted through analysis of Intel’s recent struggles and strategic opportunities. Calls from former Intel board members for structural and IP-related changes reflect a broader urgency for U.S. semiconductor competitiveness, particularly against ARM-based architectures and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd’s cost advantages, Vellante detailed. “The problem with their scenario … is Operation Warp Speed might work for vaccines, but it doesn’t work for silicon,” Vellante said. “The second, as I said, the cap table is too complicated. The third is it completely leaves TSM out of the picture. You take their cash and you take their commitment and you give them guaranteed supply over time. And the cap table is the U.S. government, U.S. taxpayers, TSM, maybe throw Intel a little bone and then the private equity.” Anshul Sadana, founder and CEO of Nexthop AI Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon Matt Garman, CEO at AWS Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Mike Speiser, managing director at Sutter Hill Ventures Reid Hoffman, partner at Greylock Partners Charlene Barshefsky, lawyer and former United States Trade Representative Scott Ferrall, American radio personality and host Jim Plummer, electrical engineer from Stanford University David B.
