We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks That Are Dominating Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating headlines. The European Union recently released the initial draft for the general-purpose AI code of practice under the AI Act, its comprehensive framework aimed at regulating artificial intelligence. This section of the AI Act, which became law earlier this year, specifically addresses general-purpose AI model providers, setting out standards and practices they must follow to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Some of the AI models that will be impacted by regulations drafted as discussions on this draft progress include GPT models by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic, among others.

Meanwhile, London-based AI startup Tessl recently raised more than $125 million in a funding round led by prominent venture capital firms like Index Ventures, Accel, GV, and Boldstart. According to a report by TechCrunch, this has pushed the valuation of the startup to more than $500 million. The startup is building an AI native platform that developers and their teams can use to create and maintain software. The firm is still developing the product and plans to launch it in the open market by sometime next year. The basic idea behind the business is to help write code to match specifications set by developers and their teams, in natural language or code.

On November 14, news agency Reuters reported that Yang Chin-long, the governor of Taiwan’s central bank, highlighted the importance of cordial relations between the US and Taiwan under a new US president, and affirmed that TSM investment in China - the chipmaker is spending $65 billion to build chip facilities in the country - could help address a trade imbalance between the two countries. In his last term as president, Donald Trump had imposed tariffs on Chinese firms but spared Taiwan. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that are dominating headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Taking Wall Street By Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm. xAI, the AI startup owned by Elon Musk, is raising more than $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, per a report by news platform CNBC. The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace.

CNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly. Trump plans on rebranding the CHIPS Act and repealing the Executive Order on AI, two major AI initiatives of US President Joe Biden. The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.

Market Capitalization: $851 Billion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. The shares of the company have been on a downward trend over the past few days despite recent reports that it had secured over $6.6 billion in funding through the CHIPS Act from the US government. Investor concerns around the incoming White House administration, which has taken several swipes at TSM during the campaign trail, are one of the major reasons behind this. Trump has asked companies to relocate advanced chip manufacturing to the United States several times over the past years. Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm.

Title: TSMC will get some of its Chips Act money before Trump takes office

The Biden administration has finalized Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.41%) Chips Act incentive funding to support its U.S. fabrication sites. The Taiwanese chipmaker signed a preliminary agreement in April for $6.6 billion in grants from the federal Chips and Science Act. The finalized award comes after the U.S. Commerce Department completed its due diligence process. TSMC is also eligible for up to $5 billion in proposed loans. TSMC will receive at least $1 billion of the total reward this year due to already meeting some of the required benchmarks, Bloomberg reported, citing Biden administration officials. The award will be disbursed as the company’s fabs in Phoenix, Arizona complete certain project milestones. The federal funding will go toward TSMC’s $65 billion private investment to build three state-of-the-art chipmaking facilities in Phoenix. TSMC already has two planned facilities in Phoenix that are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028. Some of the funding will support building the third facility. “This is the largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the history of the United States,” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. “The first of TSMC’s three facilities is on track to fully open early next year, which means that for the first time in decades an America manufacturing plant will be producing the leading-edge chips used in our most advanced technologies – from our smartphones, to autonomous vehicles, to the data centers powering artificial intelligence.” The finalized funding comes as the Biden administration and chipmakers reportedly rush to complete agreements before the incoming Trump administration. Polar Semiconductor was the first to finish negotiations and finalize its agreement. U.S. chip pioneer Intel (INTC+1.54%) reportedly expects to finalize its $8.5 billion Chips Act grant before the end of the year. During an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, president-elect Donald Trump criticized the Chips Act which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Meanwhile, TSMC’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — at its Phoenix site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan, Bloomberg previously reported. The Biden administration said the Chips Act funding includes a commitment to producing A16 chips in Arizona. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
