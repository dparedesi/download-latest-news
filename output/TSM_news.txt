Major U.S. equities indexes ticked lower on Thursday, failing to gain ground a day after soft inflation data and an upbeat start to earnings season helped drive a strong rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, ending a streak of three straight positive trading sessions. The Dow was also down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares dropped 6.0%, posting the heaviest daily loss in the S&P 500, following the healthcare giant's first earnings release since last month's fatal shooting of insurance unit chief Brian Thompson. Although quarterly profits came in ahead of expectations, UnitedHealth reported lower-than-expected revenue. An increase in medical costs also contributed to a year-over-year uptick in the firm's medical cost ratio, which compares medical expenses to total revenue. Shares of US Bancorp (USB) plunged 5.6%. The move lower came after the financial services firm reported mixed quarterly results, topping adjusted profit estimates but falling short of forecasts for its net interest margin, a key measure of a bank's effectiveness in lending its capital. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares sank 5.1% after reports that China's Commerce Ministry is launching an investigation into the legality of U.S. subsidies for chipmakers that create competitive challenges for Chinese products. With a focus on lower-end semiconductors like power and analog chips, Texas Instruments could face repercussions if Chinese officials determine the company has violated anti-dumping regulations. Shares of Dexcom (DXCM), a manufacturer of glucose-monitoring devices for patients with diabetes, gained the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, jumping 5.5%. Analysts at Piper Sandler highlighted several bullish catalysts for Dexcom, including a stable outlook for its durable medical equipment (DME) channel and the approval of reimbursement for 5 million patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. In addition, Baird analysts boosted their price target on Dexcom stock, noting improvements in salesforce productivity and growth potential in U.S. markets. JPMorgan boosted its price target on Estee Lauder (EL) stock, and shares of the makeup and skin-care specialist jumped 4.8%. Analysts said they expect this earnings season to be consequential for makers of household and personal-care products, with discussions about consumer behaviors, tariff risks, currency impacts, and interest-rate expectations likely to influence the 2025 industry outlook. Semiconductor equipment stocks advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), issued strong fourth-quarter profit guidance. The world's largest contract chipmaker highlighted an upbeat outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, which bodes well for sales of chip manufacturing gear, even as the Netherlands announced tightened export rules that could affect the industry. Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp. (KLAC), and Lam Research (LRCX) shares gained 4.5%, 4.3%, and 4.0%, respectively.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement. The Price Action of TSM Stock In the last month, the shares have advanced 11.5%, while they are up 5.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: TSMC stock rises more than 5% after record net profit driven by AI chip demand

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+3.70%) U.S.-listed shares rose by more than 6% at the market open on Thursday morning. The chipmaker’s stock was up by more than 5% during pre-market trading after its fourth-quarter earnings results beat expectations. Later in the morning, TSMC’s shares were up by around 5.6%. The company reported net revenue of NT$868.46 billion, or $26.36 billion, and record net income of NT$374.68 billion, or about $11.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31. TSMC said its fourth quarter revenue increased 38.8% year over year, while net income rose 57% from the previous year to a record high. “Our business in the fourth quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Shipments of advanced 3-nanometer chips made up 26% of total wafer revenue, TSMC said, while advanced 5-nanometer chips accounted for 34%, and 7-nanometer chips were 14% of the total. On a post-earnings call with analysts, TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said the company “observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024.” Revenue from TSMC’s AI accelerators “accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024,” Wei said. The Taiwanese chipmaker set revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2025 at between $25 billion and $25.8 billion — higher than a consensus by analysts of $24.4 billion, according to a Jefferies (JEF+1.70%) note. Wei said TSMC’s first fab in Arizona entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter using the 4-nanometer process, and reached a yield comparable to its facilities in Taiwan. The chipmaker expects “a smooth ramp-up process,” Wei said, and is confident in having “the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as for our fab in Taiwan.” TSMC is also on track with its second and third Arizona fabs, Wei said. Earlier this week, the Biden administration introduced new rules encouraging chip producers such as TSMC to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence in an effort to prevent advanced chips from getting to Chinese customers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, with the major indexes hoping to build on the previous day's surge as investors assessed another round of big bank earnings and a fresh reading on retail sales. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all meandered slightly above the flatline in early trading. Markets are still enjoying some relief from a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. An upbeat sales outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, 2330.TW) boosted optimism for AI hardware demand this year. The main chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) on Thursday booked a 57% rise in net profit to hit a quarterly record. TSMC shares popped over 5% after its earnings report, while Nvidia stock added 1%. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped nearly 0.1%, weighed on by a slide in UnitedHealth (UNH) following the health care provider's disappointing quarterly print. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here.

Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT).

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Q4 Earnings: 3nm and 5nm Nodes Lead Topline Growth, Expands Margins, Issues Strong Q1 Outlook

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.
