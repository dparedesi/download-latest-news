The outgoing Biden administration is introducing even more measures focused on keeping advanced chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for artificial intelligence and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. “Advanced AI capabilities — facilitated by supercomputing, built on advanced semiconductors — present U.S. national security concerns because they can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of military decision making, planning, and logistics,” the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement. The new rules encourage chip producers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.59%), Samsung, and Intel (INTC-0.05%), to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence to prevent advanced technology from getting to Chinese customers, Bloomberg previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The measures follow the discovery of TSMC-made tech in a cutting-edge artificial intelligence chip developed by sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei in October. According to the BIS, the new rules improve reporting for transactions with new customers who could pose a risk of diverting semiconductor components to China. Earlier this week, the U.S. published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia (NVDA-0.93%), to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others. Meanwhile, the Netherlands released new rules aimed at Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML+3.61%). Under the new export controls, ASML must apply for licenses with the Dutch government rather than the U.S. government to export certain measuring and inspection tools. The rules will be effective starting on April 1. China-based Huawei and its chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), depended on ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography machines to make advanced chips. However, the Dutch government restricted sales of this advanced tech to China last year, which has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment. China also cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make advanced chips designed by Nvidia and Apple (AAPL-3.78%).

Title: NVIDIA’s AI GPU Export Control Rules Likely To Tighten Under Trump Admin, Says Analyst

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Biden Administration's sweeping set of new rules that restrict AI chip sales to countries not aligned with US national security interests are unlikely to be watered down by the incoming Trump Administration, believes a Taiwan-based semiconductor analyst. The export control rules, which came soon after the CES conference in Las Vegas and amidst a fresh set of media reports outlining troubles with Blackwell GPU supplies, drew a sharp backlash from NVIDIA. The company, which commands an effective monopoly over the global AI chip supply chain, called the new export control rules an attempt to "undermine" American technology leadership by placing control of semiconductor exports in bureaucratic hands. The Biden Administration's latest rules divide the countries to which NVIDIA's advanced AI GPUs can be exported into three categories. The first is a list of nations that are either aligned with US national security objectives or are not a threat to the US. These countries can secure the chips without any hindrance. The second category consists of hostile nations such as Russia and Iran, which are completely barred from procuring either US-origin GPUs or AI software. Finally, the third category limits countries such as India from importing large amounts of GPUs without scrutiny. These nations will be able to import 1,700 GPUs without regulatory scrutiny, and they are designed to prevent the targeted countries from building large-scale data centers capable of advanced defense research. The rules also limit key AI software parameters, such as model weights, from being disclosed to nations. NVIDIA's response to them was hard-hitting, as it characterized the rules as threatening to "to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide." NVIDIA admitted that the new rules will not come into effect until 120 days but cautioned that they were already "undercutting U.S. interests." However, despite NVIDIA's praise of the previous Trump presidency in its comments, one analyst believes that the export rules are only set to tighten during the incoming administration. Sharing his thoughts on X, Taipei-based financial analyst Dylan Nystedt outlined several factors that make it unlikely that the issue "might go away under President Trump." He believes that the reality might be different, and "If anything, the rules are likely to become more extreme over time, not less." He starts off by sharing comments made by TSMC's founder, Dr. Morris Chang, in 2023, where he shared his thoughts and remarked that globalization is dead. Dr. Chang had made similar remarks in 2022 and saw a media mogul agree with him. In his 2023 remarks, the former TSMC boss had also supported American policy objectives of slowing down China's progress. Nystedt also believes that supercomputers are helping adversarial nations such as China and Russia to develop advanced military technologies. He outlined, "Supercomputers have already helped Russia and China develop hypersonic missiles, better jet planes and engines, improved nuclear modeling, more." As a consequence, the analyst outlines that the fear among Washington policy circles is that "AI will be able to help adversaries build far better weapons than engineering and design software has already done." He also shared a highly circulated image of a purported Chinese sixth-generation fighter aircraft prototype that appears to rival Northrop Grumman's Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. According to Nystedt, NVIDIA is misguided in its criticism of the US government. He concludes by outlining that "In its [NVIDIA] zeal to drive computing forward for the good of mankind, it forgot evil exists in the world." Nvidia is unlikely to see any change to the new US export rules on ‘AI Diffusion’ unveiled Monday (1/13). It is not an issue that might go away under President Trump. It is a US National Security issue.

The Dow and other indices rebounded on Tuesday following inflation data that came in cooler than anticipated. AI stocks that declined sharply on Monday recovered early Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA-0.93%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.82%), Palantir (PLTR+2.50%), Micron Technology (MU-0.05%), and others all rising. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, increased by only 0.2% in December. This figure was lower than the projected rise of 0.4%. Additionally, the Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained unchanged. With that, all eyes are on Wednesday’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which measures retail inflation and will help determine whether or not the Fed will lower interest rates this year. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 218 points, or 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 shed 0.25% and 0.35%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been rising in the past few days, declined slightly to 4.78%. Oil prices also decreased, with West Texas Intermediate falling by 0.7%, trading around $78.25 per barrel. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.77%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+1.04%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+4.59%) and UnitedHealth (UNH-5.76%) on Thursday. Bond markets are moving upward, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.78% as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve may delay lowering interest rates until 2026. This situation has also affected other economies. For instance, Japan, which tried to stabilize the economy and the yen last year, saw its 10-year government bond yield surpass 1%, reaching a 13-year high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the UK, 30-year gilt yields are at their highest levels since 1998. India, which is grappling with currency challenges as the rupee declines, saw its 10-year bond yield experience its biggest single-session rise in over a month on Monday, nearing a two-month high of 6.846%.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell on Monday as a continued selloff in tech stocks extended losses sparked by stronger-than-expected job reports. In the late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and 0.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a fresh high of 4.77%. Oil prices also surged 3.4%, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $79.2 per barrel, marking their highest levels since early October. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.77%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+1.04%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+4.59%) and UnitedHealth (UNH-5.76%) on Thursday. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the key inflation indicators, the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), this week. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-0.93%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Several AI-related stocks were also down, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.82%), Micron (MU-0.05%), and Palantir (PLTR+2.50%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (MRNA-3.19%) plunged more than 23% after the company slashed its sales guidance for the year. Moderna now projects 2025 revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a significant downgrade from its earlier forecast of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion posted in September. Shares of Lululemon (LULU-1.32%) surged 2.5% after the company raised its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected performance during the holiday season. The retailer now anticipates sales between $3.56 billion and $3.58 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion. The update is a positive development for investors, as the athletic apparel company has faced sluggish sales over the past year. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+3.49%) spiked one week before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for his second term in office. Trump Media stock surged more than 21% on Monday afternoon, trading at $43.17 per share. That’s among the largest single-day jumps in the company’s share value since Trump won the presidential election. In the time since Nov. 5, shares of the company — which owns Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social — have climbed 21%. Despite stocks and cryptocurrencies rallying following Trump’s election victory, Trump Media shares, which had become something of a proxy for Trump’s election odds, had a surprisingly muted response to the election results. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Faith Hung TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58% leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from U.S. government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of T$238.7 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers. "From the U.S. government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present," he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. "Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen," he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81% last year, compared with a 28.5% gain for the broader market.
