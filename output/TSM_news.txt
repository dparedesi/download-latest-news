U.S. stocks plunged Monday after the ISM manufacturing index came in lower than expected at 50.3, as new orders contracted and the price measure surged. Investors are also cautious ahead of planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada scheduled to come into effect on Tuesday. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed significantly lower. The Dow fell 650 points, or about 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was off 1.8% and the Nasdaq closed down 2.6%. Automakers, among the companies most affected by tariffs, gave up earlier gains and fell after President Trump reiterated that the duties will go into effect tomorrow. Ford (F-2.08%) dropped 1.7%, General Motors (GM-3.28%) declined 3.6% and Stellantis (STLA-4.46%) slipped 3%. All three have plants in Mexico and Canada. Tesla (TSLA-3.90%) fell 2.8%. Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+7.96%), and Dell (DELL-0.24%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Stock in Intel (INTC-6.42%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%) and TSMC (TSM+4.33%) also declined. Kroger (KR+1.43%) stock fell 2.9% after CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an investigation into his personal conduct. The grocery chain unveils its earnings report on Thursday. Weyerhaeuser (WY-1.18%) stock gained 4.3% after Trump ordered a probe of lumber imports on national security grounds. Las Vegas Sands’ (LVS-0.53%) stock 1.6% rose after the casino operator completed a debt restructuring involving its Marina Bay Sands liabilities.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-6.42%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) and Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.86%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT-0.54%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.33%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Title: Nvidia's strong earnings can't keep its stock from sliding — along with other chipmakers

Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.86%), Micron (MU+0.68%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%), and Intel (INTC-6.42%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM+4.33%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.
