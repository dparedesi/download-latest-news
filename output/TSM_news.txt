Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Shares of Intel (INTC-3.49%) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY+1.48%) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO-1.35%) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM-2.89%) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU-4.18%) was down by around 3.5%. Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.16%) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD-2.54%) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-1.15%) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. The world’s largest chipmaker was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw green Monday as stocks continued a post-election rally sparked by former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitcoin also surged on the election victory, reaching a record $84,000. With Trump’s return to the White House, the chip war between the U.S. and China could escalate. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. TSMC has also reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The U.S. has reportedly ordered the world’s largest chipmaker not to send its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.15%) was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, TSMC reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the people said. They told the Financial Times they are unsure if the rules will affect other chips that China’s leading chip firms are designing. The rules will reportedly have a minimal impact on TSMC’s revenue. TSMC said it is a “law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” in a statement previously shared with Quartz. It declined to comment further. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. TSMC’s new rules come as the chipmaker faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. The Taiwan-based company is also facing rules at home that restrict it from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, the Taipei Times reported. J.W. Kuo, Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, said that although the company will eventually produce the advanced chips abroad, “its core technology will stay” on the island. “Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips overseas currently,” Kuo said during a meeting with Taiwan’s Economics Committee, according to the Taipei Times.

Title: TSMC is cutting China off from its advanced AI chips

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.15%) is following U.S. efforts to curb China’s artificial intelligence ambitions, reportedly telling chip design firms in the country it will stop producing their most advanced AI chips. The Taiwanese chipmaker told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7 nanometer process or smaller starting on Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the people said. Chinese media site ijiwei first reported the news, according to the Financial Times. While TSMC is targeting advanced AI chips, people told the Financial Times they are unsure if the rules will affect other chips that China’s leading chip firms are designing. The rules will reportedly have a minimal impact on TSMC’s revenue. TSMC said it is a “law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” in a statement shared with Quartz, but declined to comment further. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls, and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. “We want to start mitigating before there are solid, structured regulations,” a person told the Financial Times. Another person said TSMC’s decision is “not a show for Trump but definitely designed to underscore that we are the good guys and not acting against US interests.” TSMC’s new rules come as the chipmaker faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. Meanwhile, TSMC’s production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — at its Phoenix, Arizona site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabrication sites in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported. It has also reportedly started making its first chips for Apple at the Phoenix-based fab. This story has been updated to include a statement from TSMC.
