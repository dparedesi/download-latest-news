Futures tied to major indexes are mixed this morning as chip stocks gain while health insurance stocks tumble; shares of UntedHealth and other health insurers are sliding after a government proposal to raise payments to Medicare insurers by much less than expected in 2027; UnitedHealth, Boeing and General Motors were among the big-name companies reporting earnings this morning; Micron Technology is leading chip stocks higher after the company said it has broken ground on a new manufacturing facility in Singapore; and Salesforce shares are gaining after the company announced that it has won a contract from the U.S. Army worth up to $5.6 billion over the next decade. Here's what you need to know today. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq are higher this morning as chip stocks rise, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are sharply lower as shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) plunge. (more on that below) The major indexes each gained on Monday to kick off a busy week of earnings reports, as investors await the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates tomorrow. The Dow and the S&P 500 come into the day just 0.4% away from their record closing highs. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were recently up 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow futures slid 0.5%. Gold futures are holding steady this morning at around $5,080 an ounce, after surging above the $5,000 mark for the first time over the weekend and setting a new record high on Monday. Bitcoin was also little changed at around $88,000, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at 4.23%, up from 4.21% at yesterday's close. Several health insurer stocks are tumbling ahead of the opening bell following a proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to increase payments to insurers by just 0.09% next year, well below what the industry had been expecting. Wall Street had been expecting a bump between 4% and 6%, according to The Wall Street Journal. The proposal also includes modifications to rules about diagnosing patients, amid a Department of Justice investigation following Journal reports last year that claimed UnitedHealth trained its doctors to diagnose Medicare Advantage patients with specific conditions that could result in higher payouts for the insurer, which the company has denied. UnitedHealth also reported fourth-quarter results this morning, with $113.22 billion in revenue and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share coming in roughly in line with estimates, while its 2026 revenue forecasts were lower than expected. UnitedHealth shares were down 16% in recent premarket trading, while Humana (HUM) plunged 17% and CVS Health (CVS), which owns Aetna, fell 12%. Investors are digesting quarterly results from a number of big-name companies this morning, as Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), United Parcel Service (UPS) and American Airlines (AAL) have all released earnings reports. Boeing shares were down about 1% recently after the aircraft manufacturer reported fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates, while its profits were boosted by the sale of pieces of its Digital Aviation Solutions business. GM shares were up nearly 4% after the automaker raised its guidance, boosted its dividend and announced a $6 billion stock buyback plan. GM posted a $3.3 billion loss for the fourth quarter, as it took over $7 billion in charges related to a restructuring of its electric vehicle business. UPS shares also gained about 4% after the shipping giant topped estimates in its fourth-quarter report. American Airlines shares were up more than 3% recently after its first-quarter revenue projection came in higher than expected. Investors will get more earnings over the rest of the week, including highly anticipated reports from major tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA). Shares of Micron Technology (MU) are leading chipmaker stocks higher this morning after the company announced that it has broken ground on construction for a new manufacturing facility in Singapore. The new factory, which will be part of the memory component maker's existing complex in Singapore, represents a roughly $24 billion investment over the next decade, the company said late last night. The new facility is expected to start production in the second half of 2028, and Micron also said that construction for another facility in the Singapore complex designed for high-bandwidth memory chips is on track to "contribute meaningfully" to its chip supply next year. Micron shares, which have more than tripled over the past year amid booming demand for memory and data storage devices from the AI data center buildout, were up 4% recently. Shares of others in the sector, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Intel (INTC) and Sandisk (SNDK), are also gaining this morning. Salesforce (CRM) shares are rising after the software giant announced that it has been chosen for a contract with the U.S. Army for up to 10 years and $5.6 billion. The Army will be able to use Salesforce's AI software "as the foundation for its agentic enterprise," which the company said will help the Pentagon manage costs and make decisions more efficiently. The contract includes a five-year base period, with another five-year optional buying period with a total purchase ceiling of $5.6 billion, and expands on previous deals where the military would buy individual pieces of software from Salesforce. Shares of the software maker were up 3% in recent premarket trading.
