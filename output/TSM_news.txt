An advanced chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was reportedly found in sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei’s latest artificial intelligence chips. Research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s cutting-edge AI accelerator and found an Ascend 910B chip made by TSMC (TSM+0.43%), Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Canadian research firm told TSMC about its findings, prompting the Taiwanese chipmaker to inform the U.S. government about Huawei’s possible violation of U.S. export controls, Reuters reported. The Chinese tech company said it hasn’t “produced any chips via TSMC after the implementation of the amendments made by the US Department of Commerce to its FDPR that target Huawei in 2020,” in a statement shared with Bloomberg. The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. Huawei added that it “has never launched the 910B chip.” TSMC also informed the U.S. government about a potential attempt by Huawei to have it make AI chips for the company, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker said in a statement shared with Quartz that it “proactively communicated with the U.S. commerce department regarding” a report by The Information last week that it was under investigation for making AI or smartphone chips for Huawei, which would be a violation of U.S. export controls. “We are not aware of TSMC being the subject of any investigation at this time,” TSMC said in the statement, adding that it “is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The chipmaker said it has not supplied chips to Huawei “since mid-September 2020.” “If we have any reason to believe there are potential issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance, including conducting investigations and proactively communicating with relevant parties including customers and regulatory authorities,” TSMC said in the statement. Neither Huawei nor the Department of Commerce responded to a request for comment from Quartz. TSMC informed the Commerce Department about a customer placing orders for a chip resembling the Ascend 910B processor developed by Huawei, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. After seeing the order, a person close to TSMC told the Financial Times that the company also spoke to the customer related to the order, and that any investigation would be “related to” the Taiwanese chipmaker, but that it wouldn’t be the focus. The chipmaker reportedly made the precursor to Huawei’s chip before U.S. sanctions were placed on the Chinese tech company. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Financial Times that its Bureau of Industry and Security is aware of The Information’s report, and that it “cannot comment on whether any investigation is ongoing.” Officials from the BIS met with TSMC leaders earlier this month about issues with its supply chain, Bloomberg reported, including over if third-party distributors could allow China access to restricted technology. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 1.5% during mid-day trading on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional information and a statement from TSMC.

Nvidia (NVDA-3.08%) closed at a record high Monday as Wall Street anticipates Big Tech’s earnings report in November. The chipmaker’s stock rose 4.14% and closed at $143.71 per share, and its shares continued climbing in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, the company’s stock reached an intraday record high of $142.46, according to Barron’s. Nvidia’s shares are up 198.34% so far this year. Friday, Bank of America (BAC-0.13%) raised its price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165, citing “confidence in NVDA’s competitive lead and generational opportunity.” Research analyst Vivek Arya cited “recent industry events,” including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) (TSM+0.49%) earnings results and Advanced Micro Devices’ AI event, as part of the reason for the price target lift in the Bank of America Global Research report last week. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,” Arya said. Last week, Nvidia set an intraday high after TSMC beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock briefly climbed over 3% to set an intraday record of $140.89 per share Thursday. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Meanwhile, TSMC reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell over 4% last Tuesday after closing at a record high $138.07 the previous day. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries.

Investing.com -- It was another busy week of market moves. Given earnings season is underway, we can expect it to get even more hectic. Here are Investing.com's stocks of the week: Netflix shares surged on Friday. At the time of writing, it is up more than 9% for the day. The move is, of course, in response to the streaming giant’s latest earnings release, which saw it report Q3 EPS of $5.40, $0.28 better than the analyst estimate of $5.12. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in at $9.82 billion, above the consensus estimate of $9.77 billion. The company added 5.07 million subscribers during its third quarter versus 8.76 million net new subscribers in the year-ago period. However, the figure topped Wall Street estimates, helping send shares higher in early US trading. Furthermore, Netflix’s Q4 EPS guide of $4.23 topped the consensus of $3.90, with revenue expected to be $10.13 billion, above the consensus of $10 billion. Following the earnings release, analysts at Piper Sandler said Netflix stock is set up for “another strong year.” Taiwan Semi was another big mover this week. Early on Thursday, the company reported strong earnings and guidance, which resulted in a more than 9% rise. The company’s shares gained over 7% in the week. The semiconductor firm reported Q3 EPS of $1.94, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $1.79, while revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $23.3 billion. Taiwan Semi sees Q4 2024 revenue between $26.1-26.9 billion, above the consensus of $24.9 billion. Other chip stocks also rose on the back of the company’s earnings. For example, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) tapped a new all-time high in intra-day trading Thursday, with TSM stating in its earnings call that AI demand is “real.” Following the earnings release, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock to NT$1,400 “to reflect TSMC’s stronger 3Q results/4Q guidance, better AI strength, and solid industry leadership.” Nuclear stocks have staged a strong rally in recent weeks. The bullish run began in late September after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a landmark purchase power agreement with Constellation Energy to supply nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. This week, it was announced that Kairos Power and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have signed a Master Plant Development Agreement to create a path to deploy a U.S. fleet of advanced nuclear power projects totaling 500 MW by 2035. Then two days later, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the latest tech giant to buy into nuclear power after revealing it has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects—including enabling the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). One of those agreements with Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. The news surrounding nuclear has resulted in a boost for stocks in the sector. Here are just some of the big nuclear stock movers in the last week: While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:LVMH) shares have managed to regain most of their losses, the stock fell sharply on Wednesday after the luxury group posted a 3% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said its third-quarter sales decline arose primarily “from lower growth seen in Japan, essentially due to the stronger yen.” The company also noted that “Hennessy cognac was held back by weak local demand in the Chinese market.” Despite the headwinds, analysts at Stifel believe an improvement for the company could arrive in H2 2025, driven by stimulus measures in China and a recovery in consumer sentiment. ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) was one semiconductor stock that took a hit this week. On Tuesday, it declined over 15% as its latest earnings release disappointed investors. Following the report, which seemed to be released a day early in error, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the price target to EUR 750 from EUR1,000, removing it as a top pick. The firm did, however, maintain an Overweight rating on ASML. “This Q was obviously a disaster given order weakness and cut to the company’s CY25 outlook,” said the firm. “Near term, we view a likely bottom as €600 (25x new mid-point of 2025 target model) — and with shares at €633, we think the sell-off is mostly done. As for positive catalysts, it will take some time.”

(TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

On Friday, Nomura/Instinet maintained a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (2330:TT) (NYSE: TSM) stock, while increasing the price target to NT$1,400.00 from NT$1,355.00. The revised target comes after TSMC's recent analyst meeting where the company discussed its financial performance and outlook, particularly emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving demand. The semiconductor giant reported a robust gross margin (GM) for the third quarter of 2024, reaching 57.8%, and provided guidance for the fourth quarter GM to be between 57.0% and 59.0%. These figures exceeded market expectations and reinforced the belief that a GM above 55% could become the new standard for TSMC. This is attributed to favorable pricing dynamics and efficiency improvements from the capacity conversion of its advanced N5/3 technologies. TSMC's forecast for fourth-quarter 2024 revenue growth is set at 13% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing both the analyst's prior estimate of 10% and the buy-side consensus of 5-10%. In light of this, Nomura/Instinet has increased its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for TSMC for the years 2024 to 2026 by 2-3%. The price target adjustment is based on a 24x multiple of the forecasted 2025 EPS, which remains unchanged. The analyst underscored that TSMC's stock presents an attractive value at 18x/19x NMR/BBG 2025F EPS, noting it is trading at roughly a 20% discount compared to the SOX P/E ratio. The optimism is further bolstered by TSMC's guidance, which suggests that the impact of new overseas fabs on GM will be managed effectively, with only a 2-3 percentage point dilution expected in 2025. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been the subject of positive analyst attention following strong third-quarter results. Both BofA Securities and UBS have raised their price targets for TSMC, with BofA setting it at NT$1,400 and UBS at NT$1,300, while maintaining their respective buy ratings. The upward revisions come after TSMC reported a third-quarter earnings per share of NT$12.54, surpassing market expectations by 8%. TSMC's third-quarter gross margin also made headlines, reaching 57.8%, higher than the company's guided range of 53.5-55.5%. This increase was attributed to higher utilization rates and cost improvements, particularly due to advancements in the 5/3 nanometer technologies. Additionally, TSMC has projected a gross margin expansion to 57.0-59.0% in the fourth quarter of 2024, exceeding previous expectations. Both BofA Securities and UBS are optimistic about TSMC's future, citing the company's leadership in the semiconductor industry and potential for continued growth. UBS projects TSMC's gross margin to further increase to 58.5% in 2025, considering factors such as a price increase on N5/3 technologies, improved utilization, and a decrease in N3 dilution. Moreover, TSMC reported a 12.8% sequential revenue increase to NT$23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by strong demand for 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies in smartphones and AI applications. The company also anticipates Q4 2024 revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion. These recent developments underline TSMC's robust financial performance and promising growth trajectory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with Nomura/Instinet's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth remains robust, with a 22.65% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. This growth is even more pronounced on a quarterly basis, with Q3 2024 showing an impressive 38.95% revenue growth. The company's profitability metrics are equally compelling. TSM boasts a gross profit margin of 54.45% and an operating income margin of 42.04% for the last twelve months, reflecting its operational efficiency and pricing power in the semiconductor market. These figures support the analyst's view on TSMC's ability to maintain high gross margins. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a 42.34% dividend growth over the last twelve months. This, coupled with a current dividend yield of 0.95%, underscores the company's commitment to shareholder returns amid its growth trajectory.

Title: TSMC Says It Will Take “Prompt Action” If Found In Violation of Huawei Sanctions

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has assured that it is committed to complying with all regulations that prohibit it from selling chips to and having business dealings with Chinese technology giant Huawei. Huawei is forbidden by US law to acquire high end chips that are manufactured using US origin technologies, and TSMC's comments came in response to a report that claimed that the firm was being investigated by the US for having ties to Huawei. The purported investigation is being headed by the Commerce Department, and it covers TSMC's artificial intelligence and smartphone chips. TSMC's statement comes after a paywalled report in The Information which had claimed that the Commerce Department was investigating TSMC for having supplied Huawei with chips used in either smartphones or artificial intelligence systems. Huawei's smartphone chips have been heavily scrutinized since US sanctions in 2020 stopped TSMC from selling the most advanced products to the company. For instance, TSMC cannot sell chips made through 7 nanometer or lower process technology nodes to Huawei, and with Huawei's competitors such as Apple now using 3 nanometer chips in their smartphones, the restrictions have dealt a sizable competitive blow to the firm due to its work with the Chinese government. The rise of AI has further increased the scrutiny of advanced processor shipments worldwide. These have led to NVIDIA facing US restrictions for selling some products to Huawei, and they have also increased China's efforts to develop its local AI ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western technology. In response, TSMC has stressed that it "is a law abiding company," adding that "we are committed to complying with all applicable regulations." TSMC states that if is has "any reason to believe there are issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance." With the surging demand for AI processors helping TSMC to recover from a slump in the consumer electronics industry, any violations of US law could create complications for the global semiconductor industry. Since TSMC supplies most of the chips made on order worldwide, legal and regulatory complications might restrict its access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment. This in turn could force firms to diversify their chip manufacturing supply chains. TSMC's sizable presence in Taiwan and the region's geopolitical tussles with China have also created unease in chip companies about the threat of supply chain disruption in case of conflict in the South China Sea. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang remarked last month that his firm's chip design capabilities allow it to shift away from TSMC in the worst case scenario since NVIDIA designs "diversity and redundancy into every aspect wherever we can. And then the last part of it, is, to have enough intellectual property in our company in the event that we have to shift from one fab to another, we have the ability to do it." TAIWAN SEMI $TSM RESPONSE: “TSMC IS A LAW-ABIDING COMPANY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IF WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE ISSUES, WE WILL TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.” https://t.co/H3oGDj0D6w — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 18, 2024 Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
