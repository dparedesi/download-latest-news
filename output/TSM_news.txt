As China advances its artificial intelligence industry — much to the frustration of the U.S. — competition is brewing between its homegrown AI developers. Now, one is reportedly working on its own chips with a major chipmaker. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. By producing its own chips, the company could become less dependent on Nvidia’s (NVDA) pricey graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are subject to U.S. export controls, people told The Information. Neither ByteDance nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. Last August, ByteDance released its AI-powered chatbot, Doubao, which has proven to be a tough rival to Baidu’s (BIDU) Ernie Bot — considered China’s version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is not allowed in the country. In China, Doubao passed Ernie Bot in downloads last year, and had more active monthly users on iOS, Bloomberg reported. ByteDance launched a series of Doubao large language models (LLMs) for enterprises in May, which cost less than models from rivals who have had to cut prices by up to 97% amid rising competition, according to The Information. The TikTok owner has reportedly placed orders for over 200,000 of Nvidia’s H20 chips — one of three specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls. The company is still waiting for the over $2 billion order, The Information reported. However, ByteDance now plans to order chips for training and inferencing from TSMC, which would save it billions of dollars, The Information estimated, adding that the chips are still being designed and plans are not finalized. Meanwhile, Baidu has reportedly designed its own AI chip, the Kunlun 3, which will soon start manufacturing at TSMC, a person told The Information. Earlier this month the U.S. released its latest set of export controls on critical technologies as it steps up its efforts to curb China’s technological advances. Chinese companies’ ability to work with TSMC depends on compliance with the controls, which are updated annually.

Title: What the Chips Act is missing 2 years later

Time Published: 2024-09-16T09:00:00Z

Two years after the Biden-Harris administration signed the Chips and Science Act into law, more than half of the $52 billion in subsidies designated for semiconductor manufacturing has been earmarked for 15 chipmakers. While companies including Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Samsung have plans to use the proposed funding to build facilities for manufacturing, research and development, and other chipmaking infrastructure, experts say the Chips Act is missing key components that are crucial to supporting a robust chipmaking industry in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has announced new export controls on critical technologies, including semiconductors and quantum computers, as it steps up efforts to curb China’s technological advances. The rules cover sectors which “warrant export controls because of national security concerns,” the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said. Here’s what tech and policy experts say is missing in the Chips Act, two years in. While the Chips Act aims to bring manufacturing of logic chips, memory chips, and other parts of silicon infrastructure back to the U.S., “What they’ve neglected to do is actually understand the technical stack necessary to build chips,” Steve Blank, co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford, said. Advanced chip manufacturing requires wafer fab equipment, which comes from only five companies in the world — three of which are in the U.S., Blank said. ASML (ASML), based in the Netherlands, is perhaps the most well-known manufacturer of advanced chipmaking equipment for patterning, he said, but U.S.-based Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), and LAM (LRCX) dominate the space. “The problem is that the Chips Act gave $0 to any of those companies,” Blank said. However, “while we were doing the Chips Act, we put export controls on the three U.S. companies to stop selling their advanced equipment to China.” And the export controls did not apply to Japan-based Tokyo Electron, Blank said. “So while we’ve strangled U.S. companies, Tokyo Electron sales have doubled mostly to China,” Blank said. “We’ve built a dam across half the river.” While the Biden-Harris administration has focused on toughening trade restrictions to prevent China from buying advanced chipmaking equipment, “the other piece of the puzzle is, ‘What have we done to support the three U.S. companies that make the machines?’” “Yes, it’s about time the U.S. puts those export controls on, but still, the Chips Act has been doling out billions of dollars to the people who make the factories, not the people who make the critical machinery,” Blank said. The Chips Act is also about creating new U.S. jobs, said Chris Mills Rodrigo, managing editor of Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies, a political think tank. However, there hasn’t been a lot of focus on potential workplace issues. “We spoke with semiconductor workers and also did analysis of available data on wages, and our takeaway was that there is a pretty sizable portion of the industry where the jobs aren’t great,” said Mills Rodrigo, the lead author of the IPS’s “Leveraging the CHIPS Program to Create Good Jobs for All Semiconductor Workers” report. The report found semiconductor workers are mostly concerned about low wages, grueling work schedules, and exposure to harmful and toxic chemicals. For example, most workers on the production line in chip fabs are paid hourly, and often don’t have full 40-hour weeks due to inconsistent scheduling and frequent work stoppages, Mills Rodrigo said. And while the industry has previously addressed the possible harms of exposure to toxic chemicals involved in semiconductor manufacturing, those “concerns are still popping up in foreign facilities, and there’s no real guarantee that they’re not being used here because all the companies say that the mix of chemicals they use is proprietary,” Mills Rodrigo said. Concerns around toxic chemicals were raised in the 1990s after industry-backed studies found links to increased rates of certain types of cancer and miscarriages. Meanwhile, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which sets standards for toxic chemicals, has acknowledged it hasn’t updated the standards in 50 years, rendering them “outdated and inadequate,” Mills Rodrigo said. The Biden administration should try to guarantee that the jobs being created by the Chips Act are good jobs before releasing proposed funds to recipients, Mills Rodrigo said. One way could be by using the “Good Jobs Principles” doctrine set by the Labor and Commerce Departments in 2022, Mills Rodrigo said, which addresses basic demands about wages, hiring, benefits, and bargaining rights. “I think they should be putting teeth into the contracts to actually enforce those provisions,” Mills Rodrigo said, adding that there should also be enforceable commitments for workforce development, including trainin...
