Tesla (TSLA-2.67%), Nvidia (NVDA+1.49%), Palantir and chip stocks led a Nasdaq rebound on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite index ended the day with a 1.22% gain, following a February CPI report showing that inflation slowed more than expected last month. The rebound was more muted in the rest of the market, with the S&P 500 up only about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.2%. Tesla closed up 7.6% at a little over $248 a share, Nvidia ended the day up 6.43% to close at $115.74 a share. This followed a particularly rough start to the week, as investors became increasingly worried about the effects of President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies. Tesla stock, in particular, has been on a steady decline amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and his work to slash government spending through the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Protests against the company’s showrooms and facilities, as well as vandalism of Tesla cars, have increased recently. In response, Trump on Tuesday brought five Teslas to the White House’s southern lawn, including a cherry red Model S which he ended up purchasing. Also on Tuesday, Musk shared in an X post that Tesla would commit to doubling its vehicle production in the U.S. over the next two years. Tech giant Palantir (PLTR-3.90%) was another winner of Wednesday. Palantir shares ended the day up 7.18%, closing at $83.65 a share after the company announced late Tuesday that it will be hosting its sixth Artificial Intelligence Platform event on Thursday. Chip stocks were also up following news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-2.68%) approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD-1.99%), and Broadcom (AVGO-1.13%) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s (INTC+15.62%) foundry division. TSMC would run the operations, but would not own more than 50% of the assets, according to Reuters. Earlier in March, the White House announced that TSMC plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Intel gained 4.56%, TSMC 3.63%, AMD 4.17%, and Broadcom ended the day up 2.18% Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks extended gains in premarket trading on Wednesday after an encouraging inflation report, indicating a possible rebound after the selloff on Monday and Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained about 1%, S&P 500 futures rose 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.7% at about 8:45 a.m. in New York The CPI increased 0.2% in February from January, less than consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, and slowing from the prior month’s 0.5% gain. Annual headline and core inflation eased slightly to 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively, also slightly slower than projected. Economists diverge on whether sticky inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold this year, with some expecting no interest rate cut at all and others expecting up to three rate reductions as the labor market slows amid increased uncertainty driven by Trump’s economic policies. Helping matters: President Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon canceled his doubling of tariffs on Canadian-made steel and aluminum to 50% after Premier Doug Ford of Ontario agreed to suspend a charge on electricity sent to the U.S. following a conversation with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
