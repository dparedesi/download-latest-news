Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) have tentatively agreed to form a joint venture that would run the U.S. company’s foundry business. TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer, will own a 20% stake in the combined company, according to reports citing The Information. TSMC declined to remark on the reports, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel’s foundry division produces chips for third-party customers. The business has long been the subject of deal speculation, including a report last month that TSMC approached several other chipmakers about a joint venture to operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities. The report of a tentative deal also comes less than a day after President Trump announced a sweeping package of tariffs against goods imported from other countries. Intel shares gained 2% Thursday, while TSMC shares lost close to 8% amid a broad-based decline as worries about the new tariffs rattled markets.
