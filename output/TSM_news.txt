Skip to comments. Posted on 04/30/2025 1:56:22 PM PDT by CFW The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) broke ground Tuesday on its third factory in Arizona, widening the Trump administration’s push to yank critical chip production out of China’s shadow, according to the Department of Commerce. The new fab — backed by some $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act grants and part of a broader $100 billion expansion pledge TSMC made in March — is slated to provide thousands of local jobs and anchor a domestic supply chain for everything from smartphones to fighter jet avionics, according to a TSMC press release “It’s the key,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said of domestic chip manufacturing’s national security implications in an interview with CNBC. “If we don’t produce semiconductors, we can’t make drones to protect ourselves. We can’t make fighter jets to protect ourselves. We can’t do anything unless we’ve got sufficient chips … It’s time for America to take care of itself, and that’s what we’re here to do.” (Excerpt) Read more at dailycaller.com ...

Sure, labor is cheaper in low-cost countries and some things do still have significant labor content, but much of what was outsourced wasn’t to save labor dollars, it was to please Wall St. And to avoid burdensome and costly over-regulation. And much of it would have become a disaster if the supply chain had not relocated to those same places as well - like all the parts that go into a truck or tractor. If a company like Deere manufactures its products in the US them the companies that make the parts that go into it will relocated here too. I hope it works out. Just cut off the Colorado River water now allowed into Mexico... TSMC needs to do this whether there are tariffs or not. At some point, Communist China is going to pull the trigger on an invasion and seize all of their chip plants and then the West is f-ed. Never heard about a CHIPS Act passing(2022 surprisingly) and a grant means fedgov aka the taxpayers are paying for it. I'm ok with it for this but when/if the dems get control again, that Act will be perverted to grants for insane leftist crap. Then again, considering it passed under a dem fedfov, I hope Team Trump has read the fine print. Go Trump! Go Arizona! BUMP THAT! TSMC’s water needs are significant but appear sustainable due to Phoenix’s robust water portfolio, TSMC’s aggressive recycling goals, and targeted infrastructure investments. MAGA! Make Arizona Great Again! If we can’t work under Taiwanese management it might be best to import their workers. That way we’ll be in better shape when Taiwan falls. Just be prepared to bring 100% of the workers over and blow up the old factories.
