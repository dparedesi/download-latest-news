Title: William O’Neil + Co. Investment Themes For 2025

2024 by any measure has been an extremely rewarding year for U.S. stock investors. Also, it has been a year dominated with big investment themes including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growing demand for electrical power in the U.S., the reassertion of Bitcoin and Crypto, the increasing usage of GLP-1 drugs and the rebuilding of U.S. infrastructure. As the year comes to an end, we want to look ahead to some of the possible major investment themes for 2025. These themes are from the research work by William O’Neil + Co.’s experienced equity analysts. Some of the themes are new and others are continuations of trends we saw in 2024. Themes: 1) Artificial Intelligence (AIQ) 2) Industrials: AI-Driven Demand for Data Center Infrastructure (DTCR) Key Stocks: 3) Energy - Rising Electricity Demand, Nuclear/Gas Demand to power Data Centers (RBLD) 4) Consumer - Selective Shoppers (PEJ) While inflation is easing, prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels and are likely to stay high or even increase under a potential second Trump Administration. As a result, U.S. shoppers are expected to maintain a selective spending approach focusing on purchases when they find the right products at reasonable prices. This selective spending behavior has created a clear divide between winners and losers in the consumer and retail space. Brands that resonate strongly with households earning over $100,000 continue to thrive. For instance, 75% of Walmart's market share gains last quarter came from households earning more than $100,000, contributing significantly to Walmart's stock performance in 2024. Other brands like Carvana, Cava, Sweetgreen, Sprouts, Warby Parker, On Holding, Royal Caribbean, and SharkNinja have emerged as leaders in their respective categories. Conversely, brands targeting lower-income consumers, such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Savers, have struggled. Similarly, brands like Nike and Lululemon, which have failed to captivate consumers due to a lack of innovation, have also lagged. 5) Internet - Video Ad Monetization (PNQI) Over the past two years, video streamers have introduced ad-supported tiers to capitalize on the shift in viewership and align with the growing migration of ad dollars to their platforms. As these platforms begin to scale in 2025, they are set to capture a larger share of ad spend. In 2019, linear TV captured 75% of U.S. video ad spend, with digital (including CTV) at 25%. By 2027, digital video ad spending is expected to surpass linear TV, presenting a $50B opportunity for CTV streaming to capitalize on linear TV’s decline. Additionally, the shifting of live sports rights to streaming will accelerate ad dollar migration. Among streamers, Netflix (NFLX), the only profitable pure-play platform, is a major beneficiary of cord cutting. Its advertising expansion emphasizes profitability over subscriber growth. Competitors like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA) are also prioritizing streaming profitability alongside subscriber growth. Pure-play digital video (e.g., social and short-form video) represents 8% of the ad market, with an 18% CAGR since 2019. It is projected to grow at a high-single-digit CAGR through 2028, benefiting platforms like Meta’s Reels (META) and Alphabet’s YouTube Shorts (GOOGL). Spotify’s (SPOT) venture into video is also noteworthy. Programmatic ad players like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) will benefit from increased video ad inventory across the digital and CTV landscape. In conclusion, while 2024 was an exciting and profitable year, William O’Neil + Co. believes 2025 can be as well. As such, we want to identify both themes from last year that can continue to perform in the new year as well as newly emerging themes that have a chance to produce large returns. This list curated by the William O’Neil analysts provides a good starting point for investors to consider.
