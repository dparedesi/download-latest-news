How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt? There’s no way this should have happened with competent leadership. Let me gues - they went and got politically woke with the business. Yes, woke, and lacking any vision. They got complacent at the top and favored screwing over customers instead of innovating. Competition caught up and now they have to deal with their inferior products, quality control, and some unforgiving customers. “to actually be going bankrupt? “ They have $22 billion in cash ... That’s the gist of how o remember it too. I used to work across the street from their fab outside of Sacramento and had a few friends working there. This is huge. I’m not in this business anymore but it looks to me like this represents a sea change from the personal microprocessor to the server-level AI/cloud. I hope not. I want all my computing to belong to me, including the damned software. I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management. Numerous White engineers laid off to pay exec salaries. Expect other tech companies to follow the same trajectory. Top 7 Things Linux Does Better than Windows ExplainingComputers (YT channel) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSd7wD-2x4 The second big problem is a 15GB outlook.pst file that I have failed to convert to Thunderbird. I may have to run Windows as a virtual machine, but if I do that, I'll have to make sure I can get that data to work. Believe me: I want out of Microsoft. Bfl Hope this helps. https://superuser.com/questions/19555/can-i-access-microsoft-outlook-pst-archives-with-any-other-tools linux - Can I access Microsoft Outlook PST archives with any other ... Top answer All answers (5) The .PST file is a proprietary format, and AFAIK, can only be used by Microsoft products. There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux. Answer from chills42 on superuser.com https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php Thanks, I'll take a look. I purchased a software product specifically dedicated to that end. It failed to generate a usable output, I think because of the file size. I have parted out portions of the Outlook.pst to archive files to run through that app, but haven't done it yet.

Intel (INTC) shares jumped Thursday, extending their recent rally on speculation of a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The storied chipmaker has been the subject of discussions involving a potential U.S. chipmaking partnership with TSMC, Baird analysts said Wednesday. TSMC could send engineers to Intel’s foundry business as part of such a venture, and potentially launch a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel that could benefit from U.S. government funding under the Chips Act, the analysts said. Intel’s foundry business has struggled to keep up with TSMC, losing $13.4 billion in 2024. A TSMC spokesperson declined to remark on such a deal, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The discussions come as Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence chips to be designed and manufactured domestically. Policies favoring U.S. chip manufacturers could benefit Intel’s foundry, which makes chips in the U.S. for third parties. Shares of Intel popped over 9% to $24.52 in Thursday afternoon trading and have gained nearly 30% so far this week. However, even with recent gains, the stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 months.

A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and ... [+] challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands. Investors are always on the lookout for the next Google, Nvidia or Amazon – game-changers that disrupt industries and deliver substantial returns. To identify the right growth investments it’s essential to focus on sectors with transformative growth potential, as sustainable growth goes beyond rapid expansion. It involves positioning for innovation, resilience to economic cycles, and the ability to navigate constantly-evolving global events. This analysis explores key sectors poised for growth over the next decade, based on emerging technologies, market trends, regulatory changes and investment activity. A sector is positioned for growth when it demonstrates the following: The sectors mentioned below are likely to experience transformative growth over the next decade. The revenue and growth numbers cited below are from McKinsey. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will drive the growth narrative forward over the next decade. This is reinforced by a decisive shift in U.S. AI policy, with President Trump announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed “Stargate” to build data centers and computing infrastructure for AI development. The AI market is estimated to top trillion dollars in value by 2030, up from $197 billion in 2023. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that AI software and services alone could contribute up to $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2040. For perspective, the U.S. GDP was around $29 trillion for the third quarter of 2024. With GDP typically growing at a rate of 2.5-3% annually, AI’s potential to accelerate growth lies in its ability to boost productivity, accelerate product development and shorten innovation cycles. AI will not only stimulate industry expansion but also fuel consumer demand through improved personalization. Catalysts for AI growth include advancements in machine learning and deep learning, as well as breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AI will fuel automation, revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, enable autonomous vehicle systems, and drive personalization across industries. The expansion of cloud and edge computing will further accelerate AI adoption. Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) appear well positioned to capture the growing investments in AI. Despite the DeepSeek-triggered sell-off, Nvidia is powered by a strong AI ecosystem that will provide sustained growth for the long-term. Despite the rapid growth over the past decade, cloud services have plenty of untapped potential due to under penetration of the market. Even as businesses continue to shift from traditional computing and storage models to cloud-based solutions, a 2023 survey found that enterprises with annual revenues topping $1 billion had only around 20% of their workloads currently hosted in the cloud. However, the majority of these companies plan to more than double this share by 2026. The ability to bring compelling value to enterprises migrating to the cloud should continue to drive growth in cloud services over the next decade. According to McKinsey, cloud services are projected to generate $3 trillion in EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030, by digitizing core operation, and accelerating product development. This clearly represents a value proposition. Cloud services revenues are projected to increase from $220 billion in 2022 to between $1.6 trillion and $3.4 trillion by 2040. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the top cloud infrastructure provider, though Microsoft is gaining ground, especially in the enterprise sector. Apple is currently using AWS’s custom AI chips to handle search services, and is evaluating if it can use Amazon’s newest AI chip to pre-train Apple Intelligence models. The health care sector is teeming with growth prospects, thanks to the quest for better treatments and more affordable patient care. From developing treatments to streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, AI will play a crucial role in shaping the health care sector. The multi-pronged growth in the health care sector would include advancements in telemedicine and remote healthcare (virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring), personalized and precision medicine (tailored treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle and environmental factors), health monitoring and proactive care via wearables, gene editing (technologies to alter genes within living organisms to cure genetic diseases and enhance biological traits – a slightly controversial area requiring stringent regulations and ethical considerations but brimming with explosive potential), digital health data platforms, and regenerative medicine that holds the promise of healing, replacing or regenerating tissues and organs rather than just managing diseases – but also requires careful regulatory navigation. Eli Lilly (LLY) has a blockbuster weight-loss drug in the works. Eli Lilly’s retatrutide has demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials with patients shedding roughly 25% of their body weight in just a year. In the near-term, implying as early as 2026, Lilly’s oral weight loss drug orforglipron may hit the markets. Orforglipron aims to match Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in effectiveness but without the need for injections and refrigeration. If phase three trials succeed, orforglipron could cater to the needle-phobic while unlocking a huge daily weight-loss pill market for Eli Lilly. The growth in e-commerce will be tied to immersive shopping experiences, growing internet penetration in emerging nations and category expansion in developed nations. Retail e-commerce (including food e-commerce) reported revenues of $4 trillion for 2022 or around 24% of global retail revenues. This is estimated to grow to $14-to-$20 trillion or 34%-to-47% of global retail sales by 2040. Retail e-commerce will continue to grow in emerging economies, such as Latin America, Asia and Africa as internet adoption rises in these regions amid expansion of the middle class. In 2022, retail E-Commerce represented just 12% of total retail sales in Latin America, 4% in the Middle East, and 2% in Africa. By 2040, e-commerce is estimated to account for 26% to 29% of total retail sales in Latin America, 15% to 20% in the Middle East, and 10% to 15% in Africa. For shoppers seeking hands-on-experience and enhanced product visualization, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the shopping experience will be powerful tools for making informed buying decisions. Other enablers include AI-driven personalized shopping recommendations, influencer and review-oriented social commerce (which allows direct shopping through social media apps), and omnichannel retailing (or the increasing convergence of online and offline channels like ordering online and pickup in store). Quicker and cheaper shipping could also be a key catalyst. Shopify could be a good bet amid the continued global growth in e-commerce, as it supports businesses in setting up online stores and selling products online. The digital payments landscape will get a boost from globalization, increased smartphone usage, e-commerce growth and online shopping. Wide adoption of digital wallets like Google Pay clearly indicate consumer preference for convenient, fast, seamless and secure digital payment solutions. Financial inclusion will act as a major catalyst, especially in regions with limited or without traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border transactions will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments, amid an increasing number of businesses having an international presence and consumers shopping internationally. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly automate digital payments. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart appliances, wearables, connected vehicles and even smart homes, will be capable of initiating payments autonomously. For instance, a car could automatically process payment for fuel at the gas station, or a refrigerator could place and pay for grocery orders when it detects that supplies are running low. Visa’s (V) scale, solid brand image and ability to adapt to new trends like contactless payments, mobile wallets and blockchain technology render it attractive in the digital payments space. Cybersecurity is set to evolve from a reactive to a proactive function over the next decade, as organizations strive to safeguard their data, assets and reputation from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, as digital transactions grow and transform exponentially. The cybersecurity industry’s revenues are estimated to grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $590 billion to $1.2 trillion by 2040. The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity could grow from 6% in 2022 to an estimated range of 7% to 14% by 2040. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) uses AI in its solutions, and its big push into “platformization” – encouraging customers to adopt a unified platform for all cybersecurity requirements – appears to be paying off. Palo Alto’s next-generation security (NGS) annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 40% to $4.5 billion, of which 53% came from customers that adopted platformization. The company targets 2,500-3,500 platformization deals by fiscal 2030 from 1,100 at the end of the first-quarter of 2025. Agritech, which focuses on developing smarter and more sustainable food production solutions, is poised for significant growth over the next decade. This growth will be driven by the confluence of powerful trends, including the surge in global food demand fueled by a rapidly growing population, and the urgent need for innovative farming techniques to reduce waste, conserve water and minimize environmental footprints in the face of climate change and resource depletion. From precision farming that leverages technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of crops and livestock, to vertical agriculture, where plants/crops are grown in stacked layers for more efficient land use in urban areas, agritech appears to be getting love from both governments and venture capitalists. This sector effectively addresses the twin challenges of increasing yields while using fewer resources and reducing environmental impact. Scotts Miracle-Gro’s (SMG) strategic departure from distributing third-party products to focus solely on its market-leading brands, exiting non-core markets and emphasis on inventory optimization render it an attractive investment. The company is streamlining its Hawthorne business, to prioritize energy-efficient grow lights, improved nutrient formulations, and automation systems. Hawthorne’s exposure to the cannabis industry positions it for expansion in this high-growth sector. Identifying growth stocks and sectors for the next decade is a complex challenge, requiring both a deep understanding of emerging trends and the ability to anticipate unforeseen disruptions. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic thrust remote conferencing technologies into the spotlight, driving growth in work-from-home and telemedicine sectors. A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands.
