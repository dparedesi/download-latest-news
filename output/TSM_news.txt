Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Intel (INTC-3.43%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-6.18%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-7.37%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-7.13%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO-8.16%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-5.82%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.

U.S. stock futures point lower as investors continue to monitor tariff announcements from the White House after President Donald Trump said that decisions on tomorrow's reciprocal tariffs have been made; OpenAI announces a $40 billion funding round led by Japan's SoftBank that values the ChatGPT maker at $300 billion; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warns firms that their CHIPS Act funding could be cut if they don't increase U.S. investments; and Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top FDA official. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower after indexes recovered from early losses Monday as investors await tariff updates. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.6% lower after the blue-chip index jumped 1% yesterday. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are pointing lower by a similar percentage. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is up about 2% to trade above $84,000. Gold futures are rising to another all-time high, and oil futures are ticking higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling. President Donald Trump said he has decided on tariffs to be announced tomorrow for what he called "Liberation Day." The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's decisions focused on enacting a 20% tariff on all U.S. imports or applying reciprocal tariffs that match those on U.S. exports. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) said it was ready to apply retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. if negotiations to avoid the increased import taxes were unsuccessful. OpenAI announced it has closed a $40 billion funding round that raises the ChatGPT parent's valuation to $300 billion. Japan's SoftBank is leading the founding round with up to $30 billion in investments, with another $10 billion coming from a syndicate. SoftBank's total investment depends on whether OpenAI transforms into a for-profit company before year's end. OpenAI said it would use the funding to "push the frontiers of AI research even further, scale our compute infrastructure, and deliver increasingly powerful tools." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly is pressing chipmakers set to receive federal funding to expand their U.S. production or face funding cuts. According to Bloomberg, Lutnick has warned firms receiving 2022 CHIPS and Science Act funding that it could be cut if they don't expand the size of their U.S. investments. Lutnick cited a recent announcement by chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities. Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top U.S. healthcare official over vaccine policy. Moderna stock fell almost 9% to hit a five-year low on the resignation of Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief, Peter Marks, who cited conflicts with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Moderna shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down 95% from their August 2021 peak driven by demand for their COVID-19 vaccine.

Title: Nvidia To Invest Billions In U.S. Supply Chain As Tech Companies Commit To Trump's Onshoring Pledge

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Leading artificial intelligence chip maker Nvidia NVDA plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. supply chain over the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that the increased U.S. production was being made possible thanks to suppliers such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM and Foxconn FXCOF. “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total,” Huang told the FT. “And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.” Don't Miss: Huang, speaking on March 18 during his company’s GTC convention, believed the Trump administration’s “America First” policy would enable his company to ramp up chip production in the U.S. “Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” he told the FT. Huang’s sentiments follow pledges by other tech companies to onshore manufacturing in the U.S. rather than overseas. Apple has committed to spending $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, expanding teams and facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. Trending: Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. TSMC has already committed a $100 billion investment in a chip fabrication plant in Arizona, which President Donald Trump has said would create thousands of jobs bringing Taiwan Semiconductor’s investment to "about $165 billion." “TSMC investing in the U.S. provides for a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience,” Huang told the FT. TSMC’s Taiwan-based production facilities have been an increasingly pivotal part of Nvidia and Apple’s manufacturing process, which Trump was once keen to change, previously threatening to impose tariffs on Taiwan. By pledging to build new facilities in the U.S., Trump said that Taiwan avoided a 25% tariff. “TSMC already has plants in the US and Japan, and it’s now building a new plant in Germany,” Taiwanese presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo told the Guardian. “These have nothing to do with tariffs. TSMC’s global expansion is a crucial development.” See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. Trump has been basking in a wave of tech commitments to manufacture products in the U.S. “GE Aerospace GE announced on Tuesday a nearly $1 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, the latest company to do so under the Trump administration… It marks the latest company to put money back into the U.S. economy,” Trump said. Other tech companies or those that finance them have also announced big U.S.-based investments. Meta META has announced a $65 billion investment, most of which will be used to construct new data centers to fuel its AI operations. This follows investments from Google, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN in data centers as the AI arms race heats up. Trump has announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle ORCL called Stargate, which aims to invest at least $100 billion in U.S. data centers. Many of these data centers will house the incredibly powerful GPU computers powering the AI revolution. Nvidia currently has between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market used in GPUs.
