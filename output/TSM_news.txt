Title: TSMC’s Results Add Another Feather in the Hat of AI Bulls—What You Need to Know

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted record earnings and lifted its outlook, in what could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand. The world's largest chip manufacturer posted earnings per share of $2.92 on revenue that surged 41% year-over-year to $33.10 billion in the third quarter, topping analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei pointed to "robust" AI-related demand for the growth, telling investors on Thursday's earnings call that “conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening and we believe that demand for semiconductors will continue to be very fundamental,” according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Results from TSMC, which makes chips for many of the biggest names in AI chip design like Nvidia and AMD, can be taken as an early sign of robust orders and demand for their AI chips, adding another feather in the hat of AI trade bulls. TSMC said it sees fourth-quarter revenue of between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion, and boosted its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, up from its previous projection of about 30%. Shares of TSMC climbed to a record high Thursday morning following the news before paring their early gains. The stock has added over 50% in 2025 so far.

ByJon Markman, Contributor. Skeptics are stuck on "bubble talk," but they’re missing the single clearest market signal of this AI cycle: a brutal, tightening chip supply shortage driven by one company. TSM's Capacity: The Hottest Ticket in TechTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just reported a 39% profit surge driven by demand so "insatiable" that even their next-gen 3nm process nodes can’t keep up. Revenue nearly hit $33 billion, with gross margins near 60%. TSM isn’t drowning in stockpiles; it’s running at full throttle, selling every advanced wafer the company can make. Clients like Nvidia, Apple, AMD, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers are gobbling up foundry capacity and pushing prices higher. The supply bottleneck is real and tightening. This market isn’t a bubble; it's a sold-out stadium tour. Tens of thousands are battling for a handful of tickets, driving prices to a premium and fueling frenzy. TSM’s manufacturing capacity is the hottest ticket in tech, with limited supply failing to meet global AI upgrade demand. This shortage is a testament to the overwhelming demand from every major chip designer. Secular Shift, Not Short-Term FadOf course, we’ll see corrections. That is simply gravity in action. But anyone focused on market optimism over fundamentals is fundamentally missing the point. This isn't a fad; it’s a secular shift that’s rewiring the global computing foundation. Naysayers are sleeping on a crucial truth: computing hardware must evolve with software trends. The entire IT landscape is being refitted to process AI workloads. Foundry supply can’t keep pace with soaring demand, proving the strength of this shift. TSM’s raised guidance should be a wake-up call for AI pessimists. The company expects 2025 revenue growth near the mid-30% range, fueled by robust AI demand and new tech ramps like the 2nm nodes this quarter. Scarcity Drives Lasting GrowthThe key insight: it’s not only demand but acute supply scarcity driving this. Excess supply creates bubble fears; here it’s the opposite, indicating lasting pricing power and growth.The supply crunch isn't a warning sign; it's the all-clear signal. Ignoring this fundamental supply-demand imbalance isn't just a bet against the AI trade. It is a bet against the inevitable future of computing. The AI upgrade cycle is unstoppable. For investors, the choice is clear: get aligned with the defining technological momentum of our era, or stay stranded on the sidelines, watching the biggest story in tech history accelerate without you.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports, while gold continues hitting new highs; Walmart (WMT) shares are higher after closing at record highs the last two days following news of the retailer's collaboration with OpenAI; Salesforce (CRM) shares are gaining after the company issued new long-term revenue projections; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares are rising as strong AI chip demand continues to fuel sales growth; and Nestlé is laying off 16,000 workers. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as strong earnings reports from banks continue to roll in. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, after the blue chip index closed fractionally lower yesterday. Futures linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, both of which finished higher on Wednesday, were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, this morning. Gold was up 1.4% at $4,260 an ounce, as investors continue pouring money into the safe-haven asset amid stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was little changed at $111,600, trading near its lowest levels of the month and well below the record high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a array of loans, was at 4.01%, down from 4.04% yesterday. Walmart (WMT) shares are slightly higher in premarket trading after closing at record highs the past two sessions following news the retail giant would team up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The collaboration, announced Tuesday, will allow shoppers to discover and buy items via instant checkout directly through the AI platform. The stock has gained 21% so far this year, outpacing broader market returns, as the retailer has benefitted from strong e-commerce sales and demand across income levels amid economic uncertainty. Walmart shares were up 0.1% before the opening bell, after gaining nearly 7% over the previous two sessions. Salesforce (CRM) shares are surging in premarket trading after the customer relationship software maker announced new long-term revenue targets as part of its annual conference. Salesforce said it expects $60 billion in revenue in 2030, which would reflect an annual growth rate of around 10%. The projections exclude impacts from the company’s $8 billion acquisition of data management software provider Informatica. The fresh outlook comes after the cloud-based software company recently issued current-quarter growth projections that came in below expectations. Salesforce shares, which come into today's session down roughly 30% so far in 2025, were up nearly 6% in recent trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported a huge increase in third-quarter revenue as the chipmaker continued to see strong demand amid the AI spending boom. TSMC posted third-quarter revenue of $33.10 billion, up 41% from the year-ago period and 10% from the second quarter this year. The company is forecasting fourth-quarter revenue of between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion. TSMC shares were up 2% in recent premarket trading. Nestlé announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years. About 12,000 of the eliminated will be in white-collar roles, while the remainder will be manufacturing and supply chain jobs. Nestlé said it expects to save CHF 1.0 billion ($1.256 billion) by the end of 2027. The move by new CEO Philipp Navratil comes after the company dismissed its former chief executive in September over an undisclosed relationship with a subordinate. Nestlé shares traded in Switzerland moved sharply higher Thursday.

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Do you keep an eye on your competition? Of course you do. Competition research is common sense. When you think a competitor has a great idea, adopt it or adapt it. In that spirit, once a year I compile a Purloined Portfolio, consisting of one stock from each of five rival investment managers I respect. Here goes. I’ve always been a fan of Scott Black, who heads Delphi Management in Boston. Black is a major art collector and Democratic Party donor. He is featured in Barron’s magazine each year on its stock-picking panel. From his holdings, I select Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B). Berkshire has been run for six decades by investment legend Warren Buffett, who plans to relinquish the helm at the end of this year. I think he has a good team in place, led by Greg Abel, who will be the next CEO. I regard Berkshire as the country’s most successful conglomerate. I don’t advocate breaking it up, but if Abel needed or wanted to sell off some of the pieces, I think he could reap high valuations for many of them. Randall Eley runs pension-fund money and the Edgar Lomax Value Fund (LOMAX) in Alexandria, Virginia. His largest holding is CVS Health Corp. (CVS). You might be surprised by this choice, since the stock has lost 24% of its value over the past decade. I think CVS is poised for a comeback. One of its competitors, Rite Aid, has declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Its largest competitor, Walgreens, seems to me to have lost some of its mojo. CVS is considering selling or splitting off Caremark (a pharmacy benefits manager) and Aetna (a health insurer). I’m in favor of such a move. I believe that pharmacy benefits management has build-in conflicts of interest. As for health insurance, I think it’s a difficult business because of rising health-care costs. The core drugstore business is the one that most appeals to me. A veteran international stock picker, Benard (Bernie) Horn runs the Polaris Global Value Fund. From his holdings I draw Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG). It’s the largest bank in Japan, and also owns approximately 23% of Morgan Stanley, a big investment bank in the U.S. In the past four quarters, Mitsubishi UFJ has seen profits climb 29%, on a 10% increase in revenue. Most analysts expect growth to slow down. Should you buy it? Analytical opinion is split, but I think the present valuation (14 times recent earnings and 1.3 times book value) leaves room for more gains. Matrix Asset Advisors in New York City manages a little over $1 billion, with David Katz as chief investment officer. One of the stocks he owns is L3 Harris Technologies Inc. (LHX), a defense contractor that specializes in military electronics. I think that ISR – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance – is already vital to national defense, and will become even more so. That why I like L3 Harris even though it’s more expensive than I normally go for. The stock trades at 33 times recent earnings and 24 times estimated earnings. The Buffalo International Fund, run by Nicole Kornitzer, is up more than 16% this year through October 10. From Kornitzer’s holdings, I choose the same stock I did last year, Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co. (TSM). In the past year, it’s up 47%. It might seem crazy to hope for more, but I do. Every major semiconductor company I know, except Intel Corp. (INTC), uses TSM to manufacture its chips. Thus, TSM is at the very heart of the global economy. Of course, there is geopolitical risk: An invasion of Taiwan by China is a real threat. In the past year (October 14, 2024 through October 10, 2025) my Purloined Portfolio returned 20.1%, including dividends. That handily beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index, which returned 13.3%. Leading the charge was Taiwan Semiconductor’s 47% return. Also doing well was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), drawn from David Katz’s holdings. My worst selection was Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), which declined 27%. The long-term results are also favorable. In 21 years, my Purloined Portfolios have averaged 13.2%, while the S&P 500 has averaged 11.6%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Of the 21 stolen-idea lists, 17 have been profitable and 11 have beaten the S&P. Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFG and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.
