July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: Nvidia Orders 300,000 AI Chips as Sales Expected to Resume in China

Nvidia (NVDA) ordered 300,000 chipsets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), as the chipmaker prepares to resume sales in China amid strong demand in the country, a Reuters report said. The order is for Nvidia’s H20 chips, a less-powerful AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions. Sales of the H20 in China were effectively banned earlier this year when the Trump administration instituted licensing requirements, but President Donald Trump seemed to reverse course following a recent meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,” the chipmaker said on July 14. Nvidia’s significant TSMC order adds to the company’s existing H20 stockpile of 600,000 to 700,000 chips, the report said. Sources familiar with the matter reportedly said strong Chinese demand for the chips led Nvidia to make the additional order. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to Investopedia. TSMC did not immediately respond. Shares of Nvidia were little changed shortly after the opening bell Tuesday but have increased in value by nearly a third in 2025.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record closing highs; Union Pacific (UNP) agrees to acquire fellow rail giant Norfolk Southern (NSC) for $85 billion; UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are falling in premarket trading after it slashes its full-year profit outlook; Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly orders 300,000 H20 chips from contract manufacturer TSMC (TSM) amid strong demand in China; and United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are dropping after its quarterly profit comes up short of analysts' estimates. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record highs, as investors monitor incoming earnings reports. Nasdaq futures are 0.5% higher after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high for the 10th time in 11 sessions, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% after its sixth-straight record close. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are little changed. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly higher at about $118,500. The 10-year Treasury note yield is slightly lower. Gold futures are higher. Oil futures are little changed. Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) announced that the two railroad giants were combining, creating the country's first transcontinental railroad. Union Pacific will buy Norfolk Southern for $320 per share in an $85 billion deal that will connect 50,000 miles of railroad across 43 states, linking approximately 100 North American ports. The combined company will be worth over $250 billion. The deal follows reports that the two companies were in merger discussions. Union Pacific shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading, while those of Norfolk Southern are down more than 2%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are slipping 1.5% after the health insurance giant slashed its full-year profit outlook as its second-quarter earnings came in well below analysts' estimates. The insurer posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.06 on revenue that increased about 13% year-over-year to $111.6 billion, both below analyst projections compiled by Visible Alpha. Its estimates for full-year earnings per share were slashed by about $10 as the company saw "higher realized and anticipated care trends." UnitedHealth said it "expects to return to earnings growth in 2026." Nvidia (NVDA) placed orders with contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) for 300,000 AI-focused H20 chips as it adds to its stockpiles amid strong Chinese demand, according to a report in Reuters. Earlier this month, the Trump administration gave approval for Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 chip in China after previously issuing restrictions on the AI chip. During a trip to Beijing earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the level of orders it received would determine whether it would order more production of the chip, according to the report. Nvidia shares are higher by more than 1% in premarket trading while U.S.-listed shares of TSMC are moving slightly lower. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are 4% lower in premarket trading after the shipping giant posted worse-than-expected quarterly profit while failing to provide a revenue or earnings outlook. UPS reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55, lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Its revenue fell 3% from year-ago levels but was above projections. UPS said it is not providing a revenue or profit forecast "given the current macro-economic uncertainty.” UPS shares entered Tuesday down about 20% this year

Stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the U.S. and EU reach a trade deal; Samsung will produce AI chips for Tesla (TSLA) at a Texas facility in a $16.5 billion deal; Alibaba (BABA) unveils new AI glasses set to rival those from Meta Platforms (META); and Nike (NKE) shares are moving higher after JPMorgan upgrades the footwear maker's stock on momentum for global orders. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are moving higher as investors digest the latest trade deal between the U.S. and EU, which sent global stocks mostly higher. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, after the indexes ended last week at fresh all-time closing highs. Futures associated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average are 0.1% higher as the index hovers near its all-time high set last December. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is edging lower at just below $119,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is ticking higher. Oil futures are trading higher by more than 1%. Gold futures are little changed. The U.S. and the European Union reached a trade deal Sunday that will set a 15% tariff on goods from the 27-nation bloc, half the rate that was set to take effect Aug. 1. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal, which also includes an EU commitment to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more in the country than current levels. The EU will not charge a tariff on U.S. goods. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced in a post on his X network that Samsung Electronics will produce artificial intelligence semiconductors for the automaker in a new Texas facility. Samsung had disclosed the deal to make the AI6 chip for a "large global company" was worth more than $16.5 billion. Musk said that Samsung is currently making the AI4 chip for Tesla, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will make the AI5. Tesla shares are moving nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. Alibaba (BABA) unveiled a pair of AI-powered smart glasses as the Chinese e-commerce giants seeks to compete with the likes of Meta Platforms (META) in the wearable devices market. Alibaba's Quark AI Glasses "support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription," the company said. Meta announced it would release AI-powered glasses this summer with sunglasses maker Oakley. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are 1.5% higher in premarket trading. Nike (NKE) shares are about 4% higher in premarket trading after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the footwear maker's stock to "overweight" on momentum in global orders. JPMorgan also raised its earnings per share estimates for Nike's fiscal 2026 and 2027 for the first time since downgrading the stock to "neutral" in June 2024. Late last month, Nike stock soared after it beat fiscal fourth-quarter estimates amid CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan to return to sales growth.
