We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), a chip maker for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD, attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. Its advanced microprocessors have fueled business for TSMC immensely, keeping the hopes up of investors, especially after ASML cut down guidance. On October 17, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, Bob O’Donnell, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the position of TSMC. He shared that ASML cutting its guidance has more to do with challenges in China and much less with the semiconductor industry. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid financial performance, emphasizing that the company beat earnings and raised its guidance for 2025, suggesting that TSMC is a “much better bellwether” of AI. Overall, TSMC expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30% due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also plans to spend nearly $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects revenue from AI chips to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Stephen Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities.

To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.
