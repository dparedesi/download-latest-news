On Thursday, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating and NT$1,200.00 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330:TT) (NYSE:TSM), citing expectations for a robust third-quarter earnings report. The firm anticipates that TSMC's revenue will slightly exceed the upper end of the company's forecast, with projected revenues of US $23.3 billion against guidance of US$22.4-23.2 billion. Gross margins (GMs) are also expected to be at the high end of TSMC's forecast, with an estimate of 54.8% compared to the projected range of 53.5-55.5%. The positive outlook is partly attributed to the strong growth in the N3 technology node, which is used for the latest iPhone builds and new application processors from companies like Mediatek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Additionally, the N4 node, primarily utilized for AI accelerators, is expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth. JPMorgan forecasts a quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to these factors. JPMorgan also anticipates that TSMC will continue to communicate strong demand trends for its N3 technology and a persistent supply-demand gap for advanced packaging solutions, particularly the Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology. The firm's outlook is bolstered by the expectation that 2025 will be a strong year for TSMC. This optimism is based on the sustained demand for AI accelerators, the expansion of N3 engagements beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and an anticipated uptick in gross margins due to improved yields and potential price increases for the N3E technology node. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has reported significant growth in its second quarter of 2024, with a sequential revenue increase of 13.6% in NT dollars and 10.3% in USD. The company's gross margin rose to 53.2%, and its operating margin reached 42.5%. TSMC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for more than half of the total revenue for the first time, standing at 52%. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. BofA Securities maintained a positive outlook on TSMC, reiterating a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the upcoming delivery of a high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool to TSMC from ASML (AS:ASML), which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in developing advanced semiconductor processes. TSMC's August financial report showed a revenue of NT$251 billion, a 2% decrease month-over-month but a 33% increase year-over-year. Bernstein SocGen Group updated its outlook on TSMC, increasing the price target to $220 from the previous $200, and retaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm suggests TSMC is well-positioned to perform better than its peers should a recession occur, due to its advanced technologies and market share gains. Finally, TSMC's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. As Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approaches its next earnings date on October 17, 2024, the company's financial health and market performance remain a focal point for investors. With a market capitalization of $803.45 billion and a P/E ratio of 27.72, TSMC stands as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. In the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, TSMC has reported a revenue growth of 9.44%, showcasing its ability to expand amidst a dynamic tech landscape. This is further evidenced by a substantial quarterly revenue growth of 40.07% in Q2 2024, highlighting the company's strong performance in the short term. InvestingPro Tips suggest that TSMC's robust gross profit margin of 53.36% aligns with JPMorgan's expectations of high-end gross margins for the company. Additionally, with a dividend growth of 42.6% in the same period, TSMC demonstrates its commitment to returning value to shareholders. It's worth noting that the InvestingPro product lists 15 additional tips that can provide deeper insights into TSM's financial health and investment potential. Investors may also find TSMC's price resilience of interest, with the stock trading at 94.25% of its 52-week high. This, combined with a year-to-date price total return of 76.84%, positions TSMC favorably in the eyes of growth-oriented investors. The company's fair value, as assessed by analysts, stands at $214, while InvestingPro's fair value estimation is at $161.5, offering a perspective on the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other best foreign stocks to buy now. The close of 2024 is resulting in a much needed paradigm shift for US and global equities. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic disrupted our way of living in 2020, investors have had to deal with one setback or another. While the immediate effect of the pandemic equities saw technology stocks soar, other sectors, such as energy and travel didn’t. Then, inflation rose in 2022 forcing central banks worldwide to rapidly hike interest rates, which naturally made equities much less attractive than before. Since then, rates have been high in Europe and the US as well as in the developing world. However, with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) and Bank of England’s (BOE) latest rate cut decision, things appear to be changing. The ECB got the ball rolling in June after it cut interest rates by 25 basis points and then followed up with another 25 point cut in September. These decisions have been influenced to some extent by economic growth concerns. During the press conference after she announced the rate cuts, ECB President Christine Lagarde commented that while her organization had initially expected European economic growth to pick up, this hadn’t been the case. As per Lagarde, “We have revised downwards the outlook for growth, because the consumption that we had anticipated for now, essentially, because net income has begun to increase, inflation has gone down significantly and we were expecting consumption to pick up, has not picked up. And I think that we will be looking at that carefully when we produce our next growth and GDP numbers.” During Q2 2024, the EU and broader Euro area’s GDP grew sequentially by 0.3%, which was similar to the Q1 figures. On an annual basis, the EU’s GDP marked a 0.8% growth while the Euro area’s growth was 0.6%. Lagarde’s comments were accompanied by the ECB’s updated growth estimates for 2024, 2025, and 2026. While it had expected these to sit at 0.9%, 1.4%, and 1.6%, respectively, the updated estimates reduced all of these by 0.1 percentage point. With the EU’s economic performance, one country’s under performance is relevant for the broader area as well as an analysis of foreign or exUSA economies. This country is Europe’s largest economy, Germany. The German economy was 2023’s worst performer among major economies as it contracted by 0.3%. In Q2, the GDP contracted by 0.1% sequentially and missed analyst estimates of 0.1%. This slowdown came at a time when inflation jumped by 2.6% in July and accelerated by 0.1 percentage point over June. The economic uncertainty has also affected German investors, as data from the ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index shows that the index fell to a whopping 3.6 points from an earlier 19.2 points. Analysts had expected it to sit at 17 points. Additionally, investor perceptions of the economy fell to levels last seen just as the coronavirus had started to wreak havoc in May 2020 and sat at -84.5. Germany is struggling because the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has cut its supply of cheap Russian gas. While this has increased costs, on the demand side, Germany is suffering from a weak Chinese economy. Data from the Federal Statistical Office shows that Germany’s exports to China in May sat at €7.5 billion for a 14% annual drop. Between January to May, the exports were €40.3 billion, for a 10%+ drop over 2022. With German firms such as LVMH experiencing a 14% Chinese sales drop in Q2 and Swatch witnessing a 30% drop in H1, it’s clear that Chinese consumers are in no mood for discretionary spending. This has also led to Goldman recommending that investors sell European stocks with Chinese exposure as it is worried about its basket of European stocks. As per the bank, while “a great deal of earnings downgrades have already occurred year-to-date for our luxury basket, we worry that more could take place.” It adds that “Also, the valuation premium of the basket has deflated, but remains on the high side of its history.” Pessimism about China is evident in the data as well. During Q2, the economy grew by 4.7%, with retail sales whimpering through a 2% growth rate. This was the slowest since December 2022, when the Zero COVID lock downs were still making their impact across the country. In the aftermath of the disappointing data from the world’s second largest economy, Goldman and Citi, which had earlier expected the Chinese economy to grow by 4.9% and 4.8%, slashed their estimates to 4.7%. Goldman commented “We believe the risk that China will miss the ‘around 5%’ full-year GDP growth target is on the rise, and thus the urgency for more demand-side easing measures is also increasing,” while Citi stated, “We believe fiscal policy needs to step up to so as to break the austerity trap and timely deploy growth support.” Yet, while Germany and China have struggled, the world’s largest economy America has thrived. US GDP grew by 3.1% annually in Q2, lending credence to the argument of American exceptionalism. On a quarterly basis, it was up by 0.7%, despite the fact that interest rates remain at a 24 year high. This growth has created ample room for the Federal Reserve to keep rates high, and now, most expect that an interest rate cut is incoming. Due to America’s dominant role in global economic affairs, the Fed’s decisions have a global impact. For European stocks, it meant that the day before the rate cut decision, the index tracking Europe’s top 600 stocks gained 0.5% while the British stock market jumped by 0.7%. Our Methodology To make our list of the best foreign stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 most valuable exUS stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q2 2024. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen. Care was taken to ensure that stocks that were founded in America but are headquartered in Ireland or other jurisdictions were eliminated. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer which provides it with a wide moat in the industry. Some of its biggest and most lucrative customers include tech companies like Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and AMD. Since chip designing is a complex process that takes years of development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) benefits from long term customer partnerships. It also leads its primary rival Samsung when it comes to product quality which ensures that all of the world’s biggest companies continue to rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture their chips. The firm is also currently competing with beleaguered US chip giant Intel, which plans to produce its 18A process in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) might see competition from Intel some years down the road if the latter can ramp up its products, and the only worries surrounding the firm is its operations base in Taiwan which is vulnerable to conflict with China. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: “However, we added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of the company’s manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.” Overall TSM ranks 1st on our list of best foreign stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
