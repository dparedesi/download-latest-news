Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune in excess of $150 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, almost triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, who is worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings, which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com. John Dobosz is editor of Forbes Billionaire Investor newsletter. Click here to follow John on LinkedIn.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, offering various fabrication processes. Its products are used in industries like high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, and consumer electronics. According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is set to begin volume production in 2025. The chips, currently made in Taiwan, are in high demand for generative AI and computing tasks. While the Arizona plant will handle the chips' front-end process, packaging will still take place in Taiwan due to the absence of CoWoS technology in the U.S. facility. Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) Arizona plant already serves customers like Apple and AMD. This expansion is part of TSMC's significant investment in Phoenix, supported by U.S. government subsidies to boost domestic chip production. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Bitcoin (BTCUSD) crosses the $100,000 threshold on optimism over the nomination of a cryptocurrency advocate to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); U.S. stock futures are little changed after each of the major indexes closed at all-time highs; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reportedly is in talks with Nvidia (NVDA) to build Blackwell chips in Arizona; Five Below (FIVE) stock is jumping in premarket trading after the discount retailer raised its earnings outlook and named a new CEO; American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares are sinking after the retailer lowered its full-year guidance and warned of weak holiday sales. Here's what investors need to know today. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is soaring 4% to trade over $102,000 after President-elect Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. The surge comes after the cryptocurrency had come close to breaching $100,000 in November in a post-election rally, but later fell as low as $91,000 as investors took profits. The news also boosted other crypto-related assets and companies, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) all trading at least 5% higher in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are flat after each of the major indexes hit record intraday and closing highs Wednesday. Stocks are off to a strong start this month on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-growth policies. Market watchers are also eyeing the release of more corporate earnings Thursday, including from Kroger (KR) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and digesting remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Crude futures, gold futures, and 10-year Treasury yields are little changed. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) is in talks with Nvidia (NVDA) to produce the latter's Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at the contract manufacturer's plant in Arizona, Reuters reported. TSMC is preparing to start producing the AI chips early next year, the report said, but would still have to ship them to Taiwan for packaging. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of TSMC and shares of Nvidia are ticking higher in premarket trading. Five Below (FIVE) stock is soaring 14% in premarket trading, a day after the discount retailer appointed Forever 21's Winnie Park as its new CEO, effective Dec. 16, and raised its outlook for the year, noting "solid" Black Friday sales. Net sales for the year now are seen between $3.84 billion and $3.87 billion, up from $3.73 billion to $3.80 billion previously, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected between $4.78 and $4.96, raised from the prior range of $4.35 to $4.71. Third-quarter results also beat estimates. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are slumping 13% in premarket trading, a day after the clothing retailer's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter outlook came in below analysts' expectations. AEO reported a year-over-year revenue decline to $1.29 billion and profit that fell nearly 20% to $80 million. For the holiday quarter, AEO sees revenue down 4%, below estimates, which includes "a roughly $85 million impact from the combination of the retail calendar shift and one less selling week." JPMorgan subsequently downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Fanny Potkin TAIPEI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said. TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year. TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential. Two of the sources said Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said. All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.
