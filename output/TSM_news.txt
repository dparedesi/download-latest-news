This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has assured that it is committed to complying with all regulations that prohibit it from selling chips to and having business dealings with Chinese technology giant Huawei. Huawei is forbidden by US law to acquire high end chips that are manufactured using US origin technologies, and TSMC's comments came in response to a report that claimed that the firm was being investigated by the US for having ties to Huawei. The purported investigation is being headed by the Commerce Department, and it covers TSMC's artificial intelligence and smartphone chips. TSMC's statement comes after a paywalled report in The Information which had claimed that the Commerce Department was investigating TSMC for having supplied Huawei with chips used in either smartphones or artificial intelligence systems. Huawei's smartphone chips have been heavily scrutinized since US sanctions in 2020 stopped TSMC from selling the most advanced products to the company. For instance, TSMC cannot sell chips made through 7 nanometer or lower process technology nodes to Huawei, and with Huawei's competitors such as Apple now using 3 nanometer chips in their smartphones, the restrictions have dealt a sizable competitive blow to the firm due to its work with the Chinese government. The rise of AI has further increased the scrutiny of advanced processor shipments worldwide. These have led to NVIDIA facing US restrictions for selling some products to Huawei, and they have also increased China's efforts to develop its local AI ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western technology. In response, TSMC has stressed that it "is a law abiding company," adding that "we are committed to complying with all applicable regulations." TSMC states that if is has "any reason to believe there are issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance." With the surging demand for AI processors helping TSMC to recover from a slump in the consumer electronics industry, any violations of US law could create complications for the global semiconductor industry. Since TSMC supplies most of the chips made on order worldwide, legal and regulatory complications might restrict its access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment. This in turn could force firms to diversify their chip manufacturing supply chains. TSMC's sizable presence in Taiwan and the region's geopolitical tussles with China have also created unease in chip companies about the threat of supply chain disruption in case of conflict in the South China Sea. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang remarked last month that his firm's chip design capabilities allow it to shift away from TSMC in the worst case scenario since NVIDIA designs "diversity and redundancy into every aspect wherever we can. And then the last part of it, is, to have enough intellectual property in our company in the event that we have to shift from one fab to another, we have the ability to do it." TAIWAN SEMI $TSM RESPONSE: “TSMC IS A LAW-ABIDING COMPANY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IF WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE ISSUES, WE WILL TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.” https://t.co/H3oGDj0D6w — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 18, 2024 Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed as earnings results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) helped revitalize optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and September retail sales data came in ahead of forecasts. After trading higher for most of the session and posting an all-time intraday high, the S&P 500 lost steam in the afternoon to close the session less than 0.1% lower. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal gain of less than 0.1%, while the Dow added 0.4% to print its second straight record close. Health insurer shares moved lower after industry player Elevance Health (ELV) missed profit estimates with its third-quarter results and lowered its guidance for the full year. The company attributed the shortfall to declines in Medicaid enrollments stemming from eligibility redeterminations and other changes. Elevance shares dropped 10.6%, while losses spread to other health insurance stocks with Medicaid exposure. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) plunged 12.6%, the steepest drop in the S&P 500, while Centene (CNC) stock lost 9.1%. CSX (CSX) shares tumbled 6.7% after the freight shipper's quarterly sales and profits fell short of analysts' expectations. Hurricanes Helene and Milton weighed on the company's results, while a decline in coal revenue and lower fuel charges also restrained revenues. Shares of Snap-On (SNA), a provider of tools and equipment for professional users across various industries, soared 10.0% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500. The gains came after Snap-On released its third-quarter financial results, matching analysts' revenue forecasts but exceeding earnings per share (EPS) expectations. In its largest segment, which sells tools and services to auto repair shops, Snap-On posted 4% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, suggesting a potential turnaround in that key market. The Travelers Companies (TRV) shares surged 9.0% following the insurer's third-quarter earnings report. Despite a year-over-year uptick in catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Helene and other severe weather events, Travelers more than tripled its net income compared with the year-ago period, boosted by higher premiums and increased investment income. The company also reported an improvement in its consolidated combined ratio—a key gauge of profitability for insurance companies. Investment management firm Blackstone (BX) reported better-than-expected profits alongside an increase in assets under management for the third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.3%. Blackstone's CEO noted that the firm invested or committed more than $54 billion during the quarter—the highest amount in more than two years. Blackstone's overall fund appreciation during the quarter also reached its strongest level in three years.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-2.43%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-0.19%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

Techs led US stocks higher on Thursday as TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook eased worries about AI chip demand, with the next batch of earnings on deck. Strong retail sales data also helped lift the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flatline to hold near record highs after the major averages rebounded to close with gains. Contract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom. TSMC's US-listed shares climbed 8%, poised to cross a $1 trillion market valuation if the gains hold in the regular session. Its forecast helped spur a rally chip stocks including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia. On the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November. After a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter. After the bell, Netflix becomes the first "Magnificent Seven" megacap to report, with Wall Street on watch for price-hike news to potentially lift the stock. The major averages rose on Thursday with tech stocks leading the gains after chipmaker TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook helped send the semiconductor sector higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Strong economic data also helped lift stocks. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp increase from August's 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp acceleration off August's 0.1% growth. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. The prior week's reading was revised up to 260,000. The data released Thursday morning gives fuel to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a strong September jobs report. Investors were watching the data for clues on what the Federal Reserve's interest rate move will be at the next FOMC meeting in November. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) surged 9.6% in premarket trading, putting the stock in position for an all-time high after its third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates. TSMC recorded a 54% jump in profit and raised its full-year revenue outlook. TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA) and its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as well as Broadcom (AVGO) and many other tech firms. Nvidia shares jumped 3%, AMD rose 2.7%, and Broadcom jumped 2.8% premarket on the news. Here's a look at TSMC's results: Adjusted earnings per share of 12.54 New Taiwan dollars ($0.39) versus NT$11.55 ($0.36) expected Revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.5 billion) versus NT$751.1 billion ($23.3 billion) expected The chip stocks' rally partially reverses the sector's losses earlier this week, driven by fears over potential further US trade restrictions and a gloomy report from semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. Analysts at Needham, Bernstein, Barclays, and other investment firms reiterated their buy ratings on TSM stock on Thursday morning. Of the Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company, some 23 recommend buying the stock, while only one analyst has a Hold rating.

Time Published: 2024-10-16T17:50:06Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona. The chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. “The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL+1.23%) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. TSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan. It’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said. The Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility. The company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC) is expected to beat revenue expectations for the third quarter when it reports quarterly earnings Thursday. The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 clinch fresh highs as Nvidia surges to record

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on track to notch a record high as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company. Shares rose over 3% morning trading Monday to $137.87. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday morning, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
