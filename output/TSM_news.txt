Chip foundries are responsible for producing a critical part of every piece of technology in the world. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is perhaps the most well-known chip manufacturer, known for fabricating advanced chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). The Taiwan-based chipmaker has a 92% share in advanced AI chip production, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by JPMorgan (JPM). Total global chip foundry revenue was $131.7 billion in 2024, according to TrendForce data cited by the firm. Seven chip foundries, including U.S.-based Tower (TSEM) and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, each have a 1% share of total global revenue, according to the data, while 3% of the total is shared by “Others.” Taiwanese chipmakers command a 70% share of the total revenue, while Korean companies made up 11%, and Chinese chip foundries had 8%. Here are the top six chip producers in the world by revenue share. Chinese pure-play foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor had a 2% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. China’s partially state-owned, pure-play chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as SMIC, had a 5% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. U.S.-based chip designer and manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GFS) had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan’s first chip company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Samsung, one of the world’s main producers of high-bandwidth memory chips, had a 10% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had a 62% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.01%) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.24%) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT+0.26%). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL+0.89%) and Softbank (SFTBY+1.61%) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.
