The Biden administration has finalized Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) Chips Act incentive funding to support its U.S. fabrication sites. The Taiwanese chipmaker signed a preliminary agreement in April for $6.6 billion in grants from the federal Chips and Science Act. The finalized award comes after the U.S. Commerce Department completed its due diligence process. TSMC is also eligible for up to $5 billion in proposed loans. TSMC will receive at least $1 billion of the total reward this year due to already meeting some of the required benchmarks, Bloomberg reported, citing Biden administration officials. The award will be disbursed as the company’s fabs in Phoenix, Arizona complete certain project milestones. The federal funding will go toward TSMC’s $65 billion private investment to build three state-of-the-art chipmaking facilities in Phoenix. TSMC already has two planned facilities in Phoenix that are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028. Some of the funding will support building the third facility. “This is the largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the history of the United States,” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. “The first of TSMC’s three facilities is on track to fully open early next year, which means that for the first time in decades an America manufacturing plant will be producing the leading-edge chips used in our most advanced technologies – from our smartphones, to autonomous vehicles, to the data centers powering artificial intelligence.” The finalized funding comes as the Biden administration and chipmakers reportedly rush to complete agreements before the incoming Trump administration. Polar Semiconductor was the first to finish negotiations and finalize its agreement. U.S. chip pioneer Intel (INTC) reportedly expects to finalize its $8.5 billion Chips Act grant before the end of the year. During an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, president-elect Donald Trump criticized the Chips Act which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Meanwhile, TSMC’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — at its Phoenix site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan, Bloomberg previously reported. The Biden administration said the Chips Act funding includes a commitment to producing A16 chips in Arizona. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia, Intel, and other chip stocks are dragging down the Nasdaq even as the Dow gains

Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Shares of Intel (INTC) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU) was down by around 3.5%. Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. The world’s largest chipmaker was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw green Monday as stocks continued a post-election rally sparked by former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitcoin also surged on the election victory, reaching a record $84,000. With Trump’s return to the White House, the chip war between the U.S. and China could escalate. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. TSMC has also reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The U.S. has reportedly ordered the world’s largest chipmaker not to send its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, TSMC reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the people said. They told the Financial Times they are unsure if the rules will affect other chips that China’s leading chip firms are designing. The rules will reportedly have a minimal impact on TSMC’s revenue. TSMC said it is a “law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” in a statement previously shared with Quartz. It declined to comment further. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. TSMC’s new rules come as the chipmaker faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. The Taiwan-based company is also facing rules at home that restrict it from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, the Taipei Times reported. J.W. Kuo, Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, said that although the company will eventually produce the advanced chips abroad, “its core technology will stay” on the island. “Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips overseas currently,” Kuo said during a meeting with Taiwan’s Economics Committee, according to the Taipei Times.
