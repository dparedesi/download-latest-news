Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC, Financial) dropped 3% on Monday as investors are growing concerns over its long-term strategy, and leadership is primarily responsible for this. The company was recently struggling after CEO Pat Gelsinger left the job. That is where Iohaveny has left investors wondering about the path ahead for the company and its struggle to compete in the crowded market for chipmaking. Investors have fumed at Intel's slow progress in trying to recapture its leadership position and shift to focus on AI chips alongside its struggles in its foundry business. Warning!
