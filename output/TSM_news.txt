Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.95%), Micron Technology (MU-1.67%), and Broadcom (AVGO-1.13%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.83%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.15%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE+1.04%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER-1.13%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet. The Financial Times on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the process, reports that Uber has met with advisors in recent months after a third party brought up the idea. A focus of those discussions, which the Times says are still at a very early stage, was Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber 2017. — Rocio Fabbro and William Gavin contributed to this article.

On Thursday, JPMorgan reaffirmed its Overweight rating on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), following the company's third-quarter earnings report, which surpassed expectations. The semiconductor giant reported gross margins (GM) of 57.8%, significantly higher than the anticipated mid-point guidance of 54.5% and JPMorgan's estimate of 54.8%. Moreover, TSMC provided an optimistic fourth-quarter revenue growth forecast of 13% quarter over quarter, indicating a potential further increase in gross margins. The improvement in gross margins for the second half of 2024 is attributed to better utilization rates, with N5 and N3 technology nodes operating at full capacity, and productivity gains. These positive factors have helped mitigate the challenges posed by the transition from N5 to N3 technology and increases in power tariffs. TSMC also projects that the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) will sustain for several years, driven by robust demand from hyperscaler customers and the development of practical applications. This outlook suggests the likelihood of an ongoing semiconductor industry upcycle. JPMorgan's analysis points to a potential near-term rise in TSMC's stock value, particularly in light of the company's strong guidance and margin trajectory.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.83%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.15%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” said Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Huang had previously said that the company expected smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. Looking ahead, TSMC chief C.C. Wei has said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. Wedbush analysts say the company could keep riding this high for a long while. In a note Thursday titled “No End in Sight to AI Derived Strength,” analysts, led by Matt Bryson, said the third-quarter results give more confidence to views that TSMC will be able to continue growing gross margins. TSMC’s gross margins were 58% for the quarter. The analysts expect AI chip revenues to more than triple in 2024 and account for around a mid-teens percentage of TSMC’s revenues. For the fourth quarter, TSMC estimates that its revenue will come in between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion — a multi-billion dollar increase from last quarter. It’s projecting gross profit margin of 57.0% to 59.0%, consistent with the third quarter or slightly higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker rode demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology to record third-quarter profits; Expedia (EXPE) shares are taking off after a report that Uber (UBER) was considering a takeover bid; Netflix (NFLX) is expected to grow its profit and add new subscribers in its third-quarter earnings report after markets close; shares of CSX (CSX) are falling after the railroad operator said it expects to see a drop in fourth-quarter sales on hurricane disruptions and lower coal demand; and United Airlines (UAL) shares are in focus after jumping 12% yesterday. Here's what investors need to know today. Fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported record net income of 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion) for the third quarter, a 54% year-over-year increase. TSMC's revenue also hit a record, jumping 39% to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion). Both surpassed consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. U.S-listed shares of TSMC are surging 9% in premarket trading and shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are all up at least 3%. Shares of online travel company Expedia (EXPE) are jumping 6% in premarket trading after a report that Uber Technologies (UBER) has considered a takeover bid. The Financial Times said that Uber executives "approached advisers in recent months" about a potential takeover bid of Expedia, and that "there are no current discussions." Shares of Uber are sliding by about 3%. Netflix (NFLX) shares are edging higher in premarket trading as investors anticipate the after-the-bell release of the streaming giant's third-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project Netflix will report a 33% year-over-year jump in net income to $2.24 billion, while its expected revenue of $9.77 billion would be a 14% improvement. Investors also will be watching for Netflix's subscriber totals, which are expected to increase by 4 million from the prior quarter and over 30 million more than last year to reach 282 million. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) warned that its operations would be impacted by the damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton that hit the Southeast recently, and that low fuel prices and sagging demand for coal could lead to a $200 million fourth-quarter hit. For the third quarter, CSX reported earnings per share (EPS) of 46 cents on revenue of $3.62 billion, below analysts' estimates of 48 cents on revenue of $3.68 billion. Its shares are about 5% lower in premarket trading. Investors are watching United Airlines (UAL) after its shares reached their highest levels in more than four years Wednesday. United stock jumped more than 12% in the prior session after it announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, its first since the pandemic, and it reported quarterly earnings above estimates. United Airline shares are little changed in premarket trading.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

Time Published: 2024-10-16T17:50:06Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.83%) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona. The chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. “The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL+1.39%) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. TSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan. It’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said. The Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.95%) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility. The company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.15%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.15%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA+0.95%) and Apple (AAPL+1.39%) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on track to notch a record high as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company. Shares rose over 3% morning trading Monday to $137.87. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday morning, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Netflix stock is rising after the streaming giant beat third quarter EPS and revenue estimates. Here's what to know. Investors cheered earnings from many of the biggest banks this past week, with one notable exception: Citigroup. A big reason was some confusion that took hold during the lender's quarterly call with analysts. Money market account rates vary widely.

How much equity in OpenAI will Microsoft get once the former becomes a for-profit company? The Wall Street Journal reports that both Microsoft and OpenAI have hired investment banks to negotiate Microsoft's equity — which could be substantial.
