The Nasdaq and other major indices declined following the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, with the tech-heavy index falling 1.1% by the afternoon as investors digested the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate unchanged in the 4.25% to 4.50% range and signaled continued caution about potential rate cuts, with recent economic indicators showing mixed signals. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the FOMC said in a statement. “The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level, and labor market conditions remain solid.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 dropped by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Nvidia (NVDA-4.02%), a key player in the AI sector, continued to decline, falling by 6% Wednesday following a massive selloff triggered by DeepSeek. Other AI stocks, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.38%), Micron (MU-1.11%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM+0.19%), also saw losses. Investors are now closely monitoring the earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA+0.64%), Meta (META-0.04%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%), which are due after the market’s close. Shares of coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX-1.20%) jumped over 8% following its earning reports. The Starbucks ceramic mug hype is real – so much so that CEO Brian Niccol mentioned it three times during the company’s Jan. 28 earnings call. The return of the coffeehouse classic is part of Niccol’s broader “Back to Starbucks” strategy, which aims to reestablish the company as a premium coffee brand. This move comes as the company grapples with a slight sales decline, though it exceeded Wall Street’s revenue expectations. “We reintroduced ceramic mugs and handwritten notes on cups to better connect with customers and elevate the cafe experience for those who choose to stay and work,” Niccol said during the earnings call. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+0.41%) (DJT) shares surged over 7% Wednesday after announcing plans to expand into financial services, including potential investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company, majority-owned by President Donald Trump, unveiled a new fintech brand, Truth.Fi, which will launch with up to $250 million. These funds, custodied with brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW-1.50%), will be allocated across customized exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, and other investment vehicles. — Francisco Velasquez contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 6 Semiconductor ETFs To Buy For 2025

Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their ... [+] weighting methodologies. Semiconductor stocks outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. The momentum will likely continue as global AI infrastructure spending keeps those chipmakers busy. The recently announced Stargate project funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX is an example. Stargate is slated to pour $500 billion into AI data centers over the next four years. Despite China's recent announcement about its DeepSeek technology, semiconductor stocks still have bright futures. A diversified semiconductor ETF is a smart choice if you are new to this space. Below, you will meet six high-performing semiconductor funds—one of which could fit nicely in your ETF portfolio. The universe of semiconductor ETFs is small. There are about two dozen of them in total. The list shrinks to about 10 when you exclude leveraged and inverse funds. Leverage funds use debt to amplify returns, but this also increases risk. Inverse funds produce the opposite return of an underlying index. So, if a semiconductor index rises 10%, the inverse ETF would lose 10%. Because leveraged and inverse funds are too risky for most investors, they are excluded from this list. The 10 remaining funds were sorted on their one-year total returns. Total return includes appreciation and dividends. None are dividend ETFs per se, but they do pay small yields. The list of 10 was then trimmed to the top six semiconductor ETFs, ordered from highest to lowest return. The table below introduces six semiconductor ETFs with total one-year returns ranging from 11.89% to 39.69%. Read on for an overview of each semiconductor fund. Metrics are current as of January 27 after close of trading. For more investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. SMH tracks the results of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index. The index and the fund include the 25 largest U.S. exchange-traded stocks that generate 50% or more of their revenues from semiconductors. The stocks are market-cap-weighted with a maximum weighting of 20%. VanEck's semiconductor ETF is the only pick on this list tracking the MVIS domestic semiconductor index. It is also the only fund that returned more than 30% to its shareholders over the last year. The secret is the aggressive weighting of Nvidia (NVDA) at 19.19% and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at 12.96%. This one-two punch of semiconductor stocks has delivered huge gains over the past year, but the combination is risky. Nvidia is TSM's second-largest customer, so the companies' futures are linked. This ETF bets heavily that Nvidia and, by association, TSM will continue monetizing the AI buildout. If Nvidia stumbles, you might regret the fund's high concentration of those two stocks. The Columbia ETF is an actively managed fund that invests in semiconductor companies with promising, long-term growth potential. Selection factors include the quality of the management team and intellectual property. Stocks in the portfolio are weighted by conviction—so the highest-potential securities, as determined by fund manager analysis, are held in the largest quantities. The stocks in the SEMI portfolio are picked by humans who continually research and analyze the semiconductor space. Other ETFs on this list use an index to define their holdings. The human component creates the potential to beat index performance. The trade-off is a higher expense ratio since actively managed funds are more expensive to operate. Nvidia and Broadcom are the two largest holdings. Combined, they account for more than 40% of this fund's portfolio. To date, SEMI's returns have been competitive but not segment-leading. Strive's semiconductor ETF tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index. The index and fund include the top 30 semiconductor stocks weighted with a modified market cap formula. The maximum weighting is 22.5% and the cumulative weight of stocks comprising more than 4.5% of the index is capped at 45%. Strive's fund was launched in October 2022, making it the youngest fund on this list. It has the highest average annual return since inception, partially due to good timing. The fund launched just as tech stocks started rebounding from a tough 2022. SHOC has benefited from high concentrations in Nvidia and Broadcom. The fund currently holds these stocks at 20.02% and 17.57%, respectively. ASML Holding NV (ASML) is also a top holding at 8.98%. The remaining positions are weighted at 4.5% or lower. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF tracks an index of semiconductor stocks in the S&P Total Market Index. As of January 2025, there are 41 companies in the index and the fund, and individual weightings are capped at 4.5%. The SPDR semiconductor fund includes large, mid and small cap stocks using a modified equal-weighting system. With a larger portfolio and an exposure limit of 4.5% on any one security, XSD is the most balanced of the funds on this list. Broadcom is the largest holding at 3.93%, while Nvidia is the 12th largest position at 3.01%. This fund is a nice choice for investors who want diversified exposure to smaller semiconductor stocks such as Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) and Ambarella (AMBA). Invesco's original semiconductor ETF, PSI, tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex℠ Index. Intellidex indexes identify companies with high capital gains potential by analyzing price and earnings momentum, quality, management and value. The index and fund use a modified equal-weighting system so individual stock exposures have a limited range of 1.74% to 6.47%. PSI's modified equal-weighting system reduces over-concentration risk in mega-tech stocks Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom is the fund's top holding, weighted at 6.73%, and Nvidia is number five, weighted at 4.76%. This weighting system removes Nvidia's dominance and allows smaller companies more influence over the group's performance. PSI has delivered solid growth in the past year, without relying on one or two tickers. This fund is a good choice for investors wanting more balanced exposure to the semiconductor space. PHLX is Invesco's newer semiconductor ETF, launched in 2021. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which includes the largest, U.S.-listed 30 semiconductor stocks. The stocks are weighted by market capitalization with some limitations. For example, the top three positions cannot exceed 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. SOXQ has the lowest expense ratio and the second-highest dividend yield among the ETFs here. The fund's weighting system moderates over-concentration risk while allowing the big players some room to carry the portfolio's performance. SOXQ also includes 4.45% exposure to Taiwan Semiconductor, which is left out of several other funds. Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their weighting methodologies. Market-weighted funds depend on the biggest companies, while equal-weighted funds capture more growth from smaller companies. Your risk tolerance and investing philosophy can reveal which strategy suits you best. Do you believe in letting growth stocks run? If yes, then choose a market-weighted fund. If you worry that ever-rising stock prices may ultimately retreat, opt for equal weighting. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The Nasdaq and other major indexes rebounded on Tuesday, recovering from the sharp sell-off triggered by DeepSeek’s crash, which had sent AI stocks tumbling. Nvidia, which plunged over 16% on Monday, regained more than 7% in the rebound. By the late afternoon, the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 408 points, or 2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, due on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA-4.02%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Other major chip stocks also recovered a bit on Tuesday, including Broadcom (AVGO+2.39%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.19%). This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL-1.60%), Tesla (TSLA+0.64%), Meta (META-0.04%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%). Other than tech giants, Visa (V+0.33%), Mastercard (MA-1.26%), Novartis (NVS-0.12%), and others will also share their financial report cards. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia and other tech stocks are rebounding a day after the DeepSeek AI wipeout

Nvidia (NVDA-4.02%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+0.16%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.39%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.38%), Micron (MU-1.11%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.19%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.04%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-1.60%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS-1.03%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%), Amazon (AMZN+1.17%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL+1.33%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.
