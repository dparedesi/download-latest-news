Investing Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) surged 8% on earnings as Trump announced 25% AI chip tariffs. TSMC manufactures 90% of advanced chips from Taiwan. NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) manufacture all AI chips through TSMC in Taiwan. Both face margin compression without pricing power for 25% cost increases. Qualcomm and Apple face lower exposure than pure AI chipmakers. Qualcomm makes mobile chips while Apple only consumes chips internally. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Trump’s 25% tariff on AI chips landed the same day Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) posted blowout earnings and dismissed AI bubble fears. TSMC’s stock surged 8% Thursday, pulling AMD up 12% and NVIDIA 3% in sympathy. Now investors face a critical question: which chip stocks are most exposed when the tariff hits? The policy targets AI chips specifically, with exemptions still being negotiated. What matters: manufacturing location, supply chain concentration, and revenue mix. Here are the five stocks ranked by tariff exposure, from most vulnerable to least. TSMC sits in the crosshairs. The company manufactures 90% of the world’s advanced chips from Taiwan, the geographic epicenter of tariff risk. With $3.63 trillion in trailing revenue and 59.4% gross margins, TSMC has enormous profitability to protect. A 25% tariff on Taiwan-manufactured chips hits TSMC’s customers (NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple) first, but the pain cascades back to the foundry. The company just raised 2026 capital expenditure guidance to $56 billion, signaling confidence in AI demand. CEO C.C. Wei told analysts that AI infrastructure spending would drive 30% revenue growth this year. That confidence now collides with tariff uncertainty. TSMC’s Arizona fabs won’t save it near-term. The Phoenix facilities are ramping 4nm production, but represent a fraction of total capacity. Most AI chips, NVIDIA’s H100s and H200s, AMD’s MI300 series, still come from Taiwan. If exemptions favor domestic manufacturing, TSMC faces a brutal choice: accelerate costly US expansion or watch customers shift orders to Samsung’s Korean fabs. The stock trades at 34x trailing earnings with a $1.70 trillion market cap. Institutional ownership sits at 16.3%, meaning any tariff-driven guidance cut triggers significant portfolio rebalancing. Thursday’s 8% rally on earnings looks precarious if tariff details disappoint. NVIDIA designs chips in California but manufactures them in Taiwan via TSMC. That makes every H100, H200, and upcoming Blackwell chip subject to tariff risk. The company generated $187 billion in trailing revenue with 70% gross margins—margins that can’t absorb a 25% cost increase without either raising prices (killing demand) or compressing profitability (tanking the stock). CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that AI infrastructure buildout is a multi-trillion-dollar, multi-year cycle. Gartner forecast $2.5 trillion in AI spending for 2026, with 49% allocated to infrastructure. NVIDIA captures the lion’s share. But if tariffs force hyperscalers to delay purchases or negotiate price cuts, NVIDIA’s 63% operating margins become a target. The stock’s 2.3 beta means it amplifies macro shocks. Thursday’s 3% gain on TSMC’s earnings beat shows the market still believes in the AI story. But at 45x trailing earnings and $4.46 trillion market cap, there’s limited room for tariff-induced margin compression. Exemptions for AI infrastructure could save NVIDIA—if the company can prove its chips are critical to national competitiveness. AMD’s 12% Thursday rally reflects its position as NVIDIA’s closest competitor in AI chips. The MI300 series is gaining traction in data centers, with Q3 revenue up 36% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. But AMD faces the same TSMC dependency as NVIDIA. Its chips are manufactured in Taiwan. The difference: AMD has less pricing power. Where NVIDIA commands 80-85% gross margins on AI chips, AMD’s overall gross margin sits at 51.7%. A 25% tariff hits AMD harder because it can’t pass costs to customers as easily. The company is already fighting for market share against an entrenched competitor; tariff-induced price increases would make that battle steeper. AMD’s $364 billion market cap and 1.95 beta make it more volatile than NVIDIA. The stock trades at 117x trailing earnings but just 36x forward earnings, reflecting expectations for rapid profit growth. Tariffs threaten that narrative. If AMD can secure exemptions for its data center chips—arguing they’re essential to competing with NVIDIA—the stock could outperform. Otherwise, margin compression looms. Qualcomm’s exposure is more nuanced. The company designs mobile processors and 5G chips, not AI accelerators. That puts it outside the tariff’s primary target. But Qualcomm still manufactures chips via TSMC and Samsung, creating indirect exposure. The company generated $44.3 billion in trailing revenue with 26% operating margins, lower than NVIDIA or AMD. Mobile chip markets are more price-sensitive than data center AI, so Qualcomm has limited ability to pass tariff costs to smartphone makers. The stock dropped 11% over the past week, suggesting investors are already pricing in tariff risk. Qualcomm’s saving grace: its chips aren’t explicitly AI-focused. If exemptions target AI infrastructure, Qualcomm might avoid the worst impact. But if tariffs apply broadly to all Taiwan-manufactured semiconductors, the company faces cost headwinds without the pricing power to offset them. Apple is the least exposed. The company doesn’t manufacture AI chips for external sale. Its custom silicon (A-series, M-series) powers iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While those chips incorporate AI features, they’re not sold as standalone AI accelerators. Apple’s $3.84 trillion market cap and consumer electronics focus insulate it from AI chip tariffs. The company’s supply chain includes TSMC-manufactured processors, but tariffs would hit Apple as a cost of goods sold issue, not a revenue threat. With 47% gross margins and $416 billion in trailing revenue, Apple can absorb incremental costs better than pure-play chip manufacturers. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, underperforming the semiconductor rally. That divergence reflects Apple’s limited direct AI exposure. It’s not riding the AI infrastructure wave like NVIDIA or AMD. Tariffs reinforce that positioning. TSMC and NVIDIA face the most acute tariff risk. One manufactures in the tariff zone, the other depends entirely on that manufacturing. AMD follows closely, with less pricing power to offset costs. Qualcomm and Apple sit further down the exposure curve, either because their chips aren’t AI-focused (Qualcomm) or because they’re end consumers rather than chip sellers (Apple). Thursday’s rally on TSMC earnings shows investors still believe in AI demand. But tariff exemptions will determine whether that demand translates to profits. Watch for guidance cuts if exemptions disappoint, especially from TSMC and NVIDIA. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: TSMC's Strong Earnings Sparked a Tech Stock Rally Thursday. What Does It Mean for the AI Trade?

Record earnings from contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) sparked big stock gains Thursday, suggesting there's still gas in the tank to fuel the AI rally. TSMC on Thursday reported record quarterly profit of 505 billion new Taiwan dollars ($16 billion) on record revenue of more than NT$1 trillion ($33.1 billion). Both figures were well ahead of consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares were up more than 5% in late-afternoon trading. Wall Street's response to TSMC's results underscored investors' appetite for evidence of AI-driven growth. Shares of chipmaking equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) soared 7% and 8%, respectively, pacing S&P 500 advancers, after TSMC forecast it would increase its spending on equipment and infrastructure by at least 25% this year. The AI trade stumbled in the finals months of 2025 as investors questioned the sustainability and wisdom of Silicon Valley's massive AI spending. Those concerns were on the back burner Thursday when TSMC's record results reinforced high expectations for companies with significant exposure to the AI data center buildout, including chip designers and data storage device makers. TSMC's earnings and spending plans also signaled healthy demand for AI chips, boosting the stocks of designers such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO). Wall Street's attitude toward AI has shifted over the past year. When once investors were happy to reward companies for their AI ambitions, Wall Street is increasingly looking for evidence that AI investments are delivering tangible financial benefits. “As the investment cycle continues to mature, markets are likely to exemplify greater emphasis on monetization and earnings in 2026,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a research note on Thursday. Wedbush expects the market will be led this year by companies that can demonstrate AI-related spending is improving cash flows or profit margins. That shift has produced a widening divide between the tech sector's haves and have-nots. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 12% since the start of the year, propelled higher by stocks like Micron (MU) and Lam Research Corp (LRCX), whose top and bottom lines are being bolstered by AI demand. Shares of data storage device maker Sandisk (SNDK) have risen about 70% since the start of the year—more than double the return of the S&P 500’s next-best performing stock—amid insatiable demand for the storage and memory solutions required to operate the most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, concerns about AI monetization have weighed on shares of software giants Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE), which some investors worry may struggle to fend off AI-native competition and adapt their pricing models to a new tech paradigm.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open Thursday amid a chip stock rally, while investors also digest a new slate of earnings from major banks; Oil futures are sliding as tensions around Iran's recent protests look to be easing; TSMC shares are surging after the chipmaking giant reported strong quarterly results; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs results handily topped Wall Street expectations; and Nvidia is getting closer to selling H200 chips to China with White House approval. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as chip stocks lead an early-morning rally following a strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.9% recently, while S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures hovered near unchanged. The major indexes finished lower for a second straight day on Wednesday as bank stocks retreated following earnings from several major financial institutions. Crude oil futures have dropped below $60 per barrel as tensions with Iran that boosted the commodity in recent days look to have eased. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,620 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Bitcoin, which hit its highest level in two months yesterday, was down slightly from those levels, trading at $96,800. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked up to 4.15%. Crude oil futures are tumbling Thursday morning after President Trump said that Iranian officials have told him the killing of protestors has stopped. Recent protests against the government in Iran have resulted in an estimated 2,500 or more deaths, creating uncertainty around the country's stability and therefore the stability of its oil industry. Trump had said previously that the U.S. military could get involved if the protests continued to be met with a violent response from the Iranian government. Crude oil futures surged to a three-month high on Wednesday, but WTI futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4% at $59.55 per barrel this morning. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are surging after the dominant chipmaker topped estimates in its latest quarterly report. For the fourth quarter, TSMC said it generated 1.05 trillion New Taiwan Dollars ($33.73 billion) in revenue, up 25% year-over-year, while profits surged 35% to $3.15 per American Depositary Receipt. Each metric came in higher than the analyst consensus, per estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The contract manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, making advanced chips for many of the industry's heavyweights including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). TSMC's U.S.-listed shares, which closed at a record high on Monday, were up 6% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia and AMD added 1% and 2%, respectively. Shares of ASML (ASML), which makes equipment used by TSMC and other chipmakers to manufacture the semiconductors, were up more than 7% ahead of the opening bell. The heavy flow of earnings reports from major financial institutions continued this morning, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) all releasing fourth-quarterly results. BlackRock reported first, with revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and total assets under management each coming in higher than analysts had forecast. Results from Goldman and Morgan Stanley also handily topped Wall Street expectations. Bank stocks have had a rough week. They sank Monday on a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, and remained under pressure after a string of mixed reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). BlackRock shares were up about 2% in recent premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley fell slightly and Goldman dropped 2%. Nvidia moved a step closer to being able to sell its H200 chips to customers in China again this week, as the Department of Commerce updated its rules for semiconductor exports and Trump said his administration would support the sales. Last month, Trump said Nvidia would be allowed to sell the H200 chips, less advanced than Nvidia's Blackwell and new Vera Rubin chips, to China with the U.S. government receiving a 25% cut of the revenue. The Commerce Department said it would shift from rejecting exports of the chips to a case-by-case review. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand has been strong from Chinese customers, but the Chinese government has previously told companies in the country not to buy less advanced Nvidia chips over concerns of the U.S. government's involvement in the process. Nvidia shares were up about 1% recently.
