Nvidia (NVDA+1.68%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.22%), Micron (MU+2.74%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.72%), and Intel (INTC+3.55%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-0.44%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Posted on 02/26/2025 8:53:15 AM PST by SeekAndFind KEY TAKEAWAYSApple announced plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on a swath of investments, including hiring 20,000 new workers to make artificial intelligence servers in a new Texas-based factory. Apple said the 250,000-square foot Texas factory will support its Apple Intelligence AI model and will open in 2026. Apple said the $500 billion investment plan marks its largest-ever spend commitment, and includes creating a manufacturing academy and doubling the size of its US advanced manufacturing fund. Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on a swath of investments, including hiring 20,000 new workers to make artificial intelligence servers in a new Texas-based factory. Apple called the investment plan its "largest-ever spend committment." It announced plans to open—with partners—a new factory in Houston, Texas, that will build AI servers previously made outside the U.S. and create a manufacturing academy in Michigan. The iPhone maker said the investment would also fund the acceleration of investments in AI and research & development into silicon engineering as well as double the size of its U.S. advanced manufacturing fund—which supports "innovation and high-skilled manufacturing" jobs in the country—to $10 billion. The plan by the iPhone maker comes as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and hiked those on Chinese products to incentivise companies to produce goods domestically. Apple said it plans to hire around 20,000 people in the next four years for the Houston facility, most of whom will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.
