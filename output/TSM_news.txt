November 12, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire This article has been disseminated on behalf of ESGold Corp., which may include a paid advertisement. AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Artificial intelligence may be driven by algorithms and code, but its hardware backbone depends on gold and silver — the same precious metals that connect every chip, circuit board and data hub worldwide. Global reserves of these materials are tightening even as industrial demand accelerates, creating a structural imbalance few foresaw. Silver remains unmatched as the essential conductor embedded in photovoltaic cells and high-speed electronic networks, while gold continues to serve as the corrosion-resistant benchmark for bonding wires, connectors and precision components. According to the World Gold Council, technology demand for gold reached approximately 326 tonnes last year, a 7% year-over-year increase, translating to more than 10.5 million ounces consumed across electronics and industrial applications. As AI infrastructure expands worldwide, that appetite for conductive metals is projected to rise sharply. Positioned to meet this growing need, ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (Profile) is advancing a fully funded, fully permitted gold-silver project engineered for near-term production and sustained growth. The company is working to align itself with the evolving ecosystem of producers and end users powering the next industrial transformation, including industry leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM).

AI Boom Turns Metals into New Bottleneck As the digital economy expands, the constraint is no longer software innovation but the physical supply of metals that makes modern intelligence possible. According to Goldman Sachs Research, electricity consumption from data centers is projected to surge by up to 165% by 2030 compared with 2023 levels, driven by the rapid construction of AI-optimized, high-density facilities. This explosive scale-up is cascading through supply chains. Every new server, accelerator and switch relies on gold-plated connectors and silver-rich solders, components whose durability and conductivity depend on these metals’ unique characteristics. The result is not a minor adjustment but a full-scale infrastructure transformation that pushes materials from background costs to headline risks. When supply tightens, manufacturing cannot wait. Production lines must continue, forcing technology companies to pay premiums to secure critical inputs. The signs of strain are already visible. Utilities across the United States are revising capacity plans around surging AI-driven electricity demand, while analysts warn that global data center consumption could more than double by 2030. In the spot market, stress has flared as well: in October 2025, Reuters reported a silver shortage in London significant enough to require airlifting bars, sending lease rates sharply higher before stabilizing. For manufacturers, these developments mean urgency, not choice; when gold-plated contacts and silver-bearing solders are essential, there is no substitute. Electronics and renewable energy sectors are compounding the draw. The World Gold Council reports that technology demand for gold rose to 326 tonnes in 2024, equivalent to roughly 10.5 million ounces, while the Silver Institute logged industrial silver demand at a record 680.5 million ounces, marking the fourth consecutive year of structural deficit. Even smartphones are a steady source of consumption: Each device contains around 7 to 34 milligrams of gold, and with roughly 1.4 billion units produced annually, they represent a consistent, noncyclical sink before factoring in PCs, servers and networking equipment. The outcome is a tightening materials stack that increasingly dictates the pace and cost of AI, EV and solar deployment. Clean, Construction-Ready Supply on Track In this tightening landscape, ESGold is positioning its flagship Montauban Gold-Silver Project to deliver near-term, clean metal supply without the long permitting timelines or financing gaps that delay many mining ventures. The Québec-based project is fully permitted and fully funded through construction, which is slated for completion in late 2025, with first production anticipated in 2026. For investors, that combination of capital security, regulatory clearance and visible progress eliminates many of the standard risks that hinder development-stage projects. ESGold’s strategy centers on reprocessing historical tailings instead of pursuing a traditional greenfield mine build. By leveraging existing, mined material and a proven, environmentally responsible processing circuit, the company aims to accelerate its path to cash flow while preserving upside for broader district exploration. Company updates have detailed ongoing installation and commissioning of a Merrill-Crowe recovery system, alongside an on-site lab and gold room, all tangible milestones that mark the transition from planning to production readiness. Funding stability remains a cornerstone of ESGold’s story. A September 2025 update confirmed full financing to complete Montauban’s buildout and advance a parallel validation initiative in Colombia. In a market where many junior miners struggle for capital, a clear route to commissioning is a strategic advantage, particularly as industrial and technology players grow more attuned to materials security and reliable supply. Turning Waste into Value and Growth ESGold’s business model reverses the traditional mining playbook. Instead of requiring years of exploration and heavy upfront spending, it generates early revenue by reprocessing tailings — monetizing material already extracted — while contributing to environmental restoration. The company’s updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) outlines compelling economics, including an after-tax internal rate of return of about 60%, a payback period of less than two years, and an after-tax net present value above C$24 million at a 5% discount rate based on stated recovery and pricing assumptions. While PEAs are inherently preliminary, these figures depict a fast-cycling project capable of reinvesting capital into expansion and exploration. That pace matters in today’s market, where hardware manufacturers and energy developers face extended supply lead times. Bringing additional gold and silver to market by 2026 positions ESGold ahead of slower-moving peers. Self-funded growth also offers flexibility: Revenues from tailings can support step-out drilling or modular capacity increases with less dilution, strengthening long-term project resilience. Tailings reprocessing aligns neatly with modern environmental and supply chain priorities. Recovering metals from previously mined material reduces permitting complexity, minimizes new waste, and produces clean, saleable metal, all attributes increasingly valued by downstream buyers. As technology and renewable energy companies tighten ESG procurement standards, the intersection of early cash flow and responsible production widens ESGold’s potential offtake opportunities. Scalable Growth in a Supply-Constrained Market By working with known, high-grade tailings rather than exploring from scratch, ESGold eliminates much of the uncertainty that typically accompanies early-stage projects while maintaining upside for discovery across the Montauban district. The company’s steady construction progress on a fully permitted, fully financed project stands out in a preproduction sector where many competitors remain years away from revenue. Scalability is central to ESGold’s long-term vision. Tailings reprocessing is modular by design; it can be replicated efficiently across other regions once technical processes are validated. ESGold has indicated its intention to expand this “tailings-to-cash-flow” model throughout the Americas, layering in throughput and revenue while keeping risk manageable. This approach appeals to both end users, who seek diversified, verifiable metal sources, and financiers, who value repeatable, low-capex unit economics. Market conditions reinforce the opportunity. Industrial silver demand hit 680.5 million ounces in 2024, its highest level on record, while the global market ran a fourth consecutive deficit. For gold, the World Gold Council attributes technology-related growth to AI and electronics. In such an environment, near-term producers with proven funding and infrastructure readiness can capture premium pricing and preferred offtake relationships while others remain in development limbo. Expanding Discovery Across Montauban Alongside construction, ESGold is advancing exploration across the Montauban district. The company reports that its 3D geological modeling program is nearly complete, integrating historic and geophysical data to pinpoint deeper, previously untapped structures. Technical studies indicate continuous geological formations extending to about 1,200 meters, suggesting the potential for large-scale mineralization beyond the tailings resource. Earlier updates cited passive seismic imaging as a key tool refining Montauban’s structural understanding. The intent is to evolve from a single-site reprocessing project into a multifeed “hub and spoke” operation sourcing material from both tailings and new discoveries. ESGold’s parallel progress on permitting ensures drilling can begin swiftly once exploration targets are finalized, maintaining operational momentum. This dual-track approach — producing revenue while pursuing exploration — sets ESGold apart from peers that must choose between near-term cash flow and long-term upside. The Montauban project seeks to deliver both: immediate production from tailings and the potential for district-scale expansion. Even if only a portion of these deeper zones convert to defined resources, ESGold’s growth runway could extend well beyond its initial operating phase. This balance, near-term production with concurrent exploration, differentiates ESGold from juniors locked into long-dated builds. Investors are often forced to choose between cash flow and blue-sky upside. Montauban aims to deliver both, sequencing revenue first and then targeting scale. If even part of the deeper target set converts into resources, the platform for a multiyear district story strengthens. If not, the base case remains a permitted, funded operation monetizing tailings in a tight metals market. Ready Supply in Tightening Market Scarcity creates opportunity. With AI infrastructure, EV production and solar deployment all intensifying demand for precious metals, supply constraints are moving from a background concern to a central business risk for manufacturers. The Silver Institute’s data confirming consecutive structural deficits, along with spot-market disruptions such as the recent London squeeze, illustrate how quickly inventory stress can surface when industrial and investor demand converge. For producers capable of adding new metal supply with low capital costs and rapid paybacks, these market dynamics favor revaluation as production nears. Few preproduction companies can credibly claim to be both fully permitted and fully funded while advancing construction on schedule. ESGold’s PEA projects a roughly 60% after-tax internal rate of return and a payback under two years, underscoring the project’s efficiency. As AI and renewable infrastructure expand globally, the material bottleneck is becoming a defining theme, and ESGold is positioned to address it directly. The broader narrative returns to the core thesis: AI, electrification and renewable energy are as much materials revolutions as they are technological ones. Gold and silver are not merely safe-haven assets; they are essential building blocks of digital and clean energy ecosystems. As industrial demand rises and new mine development remains slow, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that can provide dependable near-term supply while maintaining exploration upside. ESGold belongs to this select group. With its Montauban Gold-Silver Project fully financed, fully permitted, and advancing toward production in 2026, the company offers both stability and scalability. Ongoing exploration adds long-term potential, creating a balanced opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the metals that underpin the next generation of technology and energy infrastructure.

A man placing coins with growing tree with white up arrow of financial developments and business growth</a> (<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/license" target="_blank" style="100%">Shutterstock.com</a>) by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Sichon" target="_blank" style="100%">Sichon</a> If the headline yield today is not something you’re concerned with, and you pay more attention to how fast a yield can grow, then it’s worth buying dividend stocks you can forget about for decades. By the time you cash out, stocks like TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) may snowball fast enough to beat the broader market significantly. As with any strategy, there are pros and cons to keep in mind. The most significant disadvantage is that things become highly unpredictable when you stretch out your time horizon decades into the future. To account for this disadvantage, you should only put your money into blue-chip dividend growth stocks. The advantage of investing in dividend stocks with snowballing payouts is that it can keep you ahead of the broader market over the long term. For example, a stock that yields 2% and grows its dividends by 10% annually could compound to a 35% yield on cost at year 30. The following three dividend growth stocks can make that happen. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, has been a major beneficiary of the semiconductor boom. Most semiconductor companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are actually fabless companies, meaning the manufacturing is done by TSMC. Many investors overlook just how much pricing power and importance this one company holds over the entire tech industry today. This is why TSM stock is perhaps the best way to play the AI game long-term. It doesn’t matter if Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), or some other company dominates the future AI chip industry. Rest assured, TSMC is likely to be the one manufacturing these chips. The company is in the process of building plants in Arizona to ensure that it can survive any Taiwan-specific shocks while lessening any future tariff impacts. TSM is already exempt from paying chip tariffs. Hence, I see it as a safe long-term stock to hold if you want snowballing dividends. TSM comes with a trailing dividend yield of 1.09%, but the five-year dividend growth rate is at 11.28% annually. The payout ratio is also very low at 4.88%. If TSM were to distribute 20% of its earnings as dividends, the dividend yield would approach 4.5%. EPS is expected to grow from $10.35 in 2025 to $15.6 in 2027. So, even a constant payout ratio of 5% can lead to solid dividend growth here. Fastenal is an industrial supply company that specializes in fasteners, tools, and related products. FAST stock has been one of the most reliable and dependable long-term names, and the growth trajectory has been highly predictable. That said, it is currently undergoing a cooldown, as the stock has retreated by 19% from its peak of $50. It is still up 15% year-to-date, and it remains in a strong long-term uptrend. Thus, I see no reason to be bearish here. In fact, the discount gives you a great entry point. You get a 2.15% yield with a five-year dividend growth rate of 11.84% annually. EPS is expected to grow at ~10% annually for the foreseeable future, and the ongoing push to onshore and reindustrialize America could lead to more positive surprises down the line. Novo Nordisk is in the toughest spot compared to the two other stocks in this list, but it also gives you the most opportunity. The weight loss market is huge, and the rising tide is likely to lift all boats in the long term, including Novo Nordisk. NVO stock is down nearly 58% over the past year due to slowing demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Novo Nordisk also cut its full-year 2025 growth guidance four times. It now expects sales growth of 8% to 11%. The company also abandoned its $10 billion bid for Metsera. On the flip side, the stock looks very cheap at these levels. You’re paying less than 13x forward earnings now for a company with significant long-term potential. The market for weight-loss drugs remains huge, and it retains a larger market share in Europe, where it is based. This is a good buy-the-dip opportunity if you want to buy and hold for decades. You get a juicy 3.78% dividend yield to sweeten the deal. The five-year dividend growth rate is 21.57% annually, and the payout ratio is at 52.39%.
