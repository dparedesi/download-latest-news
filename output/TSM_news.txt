Posted on 02/26/2025 8:53:15 AM PST by SeekAndFind KEY TAKEAWAYSApple announced plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on a swath of investments, including hiring 20,000 new workers to make artificial intelligence servers in a new Texas-based factory. Apple said the 250,000-square foot Texas factory will support its Apple Intelligence AI model and will open in 2026. Apple said the $500 billion investment plan marks its largest-ever spend commitment, and includes creating a manufacturing academy and doubling the size of its US advanced manufacturing fund. Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on a swath of investments, including hiring 20,000 new workers to make artificial intelligence servers in a new Texas-based factory. Apple called the investment plan its "largest-ever spend committment." It announced plans to open—with partners—a new factory in Houston, Texas, that will build AI servers previously made outside the U.S. and create a manufacturing academy in Michigan. The iPhone maker said the investment would also fund the acceleration of investments in AI and research & development into silicon engineering as well as double the size of its U.S. advanced manufacturing fund—which supports "innovation and high-skilled manufacturing" jobs in the country—to $10 billion. The plan by the iPhone maker comes as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and hiked those on Chinese products to incentivise companies to produce goods domestically. Apple said it plans to hire around 20,000 people in the next four years for the Houston facility, most of whom will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.
