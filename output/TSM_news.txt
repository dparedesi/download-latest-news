Posted on 02/16/2025 3:32:47 PM PST by SunkenCiv Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are reportedly weighing plans to bid for Intel that would result in the storied chipmaker breaking up.According to The Wall Street Journal in a report Saturday, Broadcom has been looking into Intel’s chip-design and marketing business and and has “informally discussed” a bid with its advisers if it finds a partner for Intel’s chip-making operations.The report said TSMC has examined taking over some or all of Intel’s chip plants, meanwhile, as part of an investor consortium or another structure.

How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt? There’s no way this should have happened with competent leadership. Let me gues - they went and got politically woke with the business. Yes, woke, and lacking any vision. They got complacent at the top and favored screwing over customers instead of innovating. Competition caught up and now they have to deal with their inferior products, quality control, and some unforgiving customers. “to actually be going bankrupt? “ They have $22 billion in cash ... That’s the gist of how o remember it too. I used to work across the street from their fab outside of Sacramento and had a few friends working there. This is huge. I’m not in this business anymore but it looks to me like this represents a sea change from the personal microprocessor to the server-level AI/cloud. I hope not. I want all my computing to belong to me, including the damned software. I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management. Numerous White engineers laid off to pay exec salaries. Expect other tech companies to follow the same trajectory.

Top answer All answers (5) The .PST file is a proprietary format, and AFAIK, can only be used by Microsoft products. There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux. Answer from chills42 on superuser.com https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php Thanks, I'll take a look. I purchased a software product specifically dedicated to that end. It failed to generate a usable output, I think because of the file size. I have parted out portions of the Outlook.pst to archive files to run through that app, but haven't done it yet.

Title: Intel Stock Surges on Speculation of TSMC Deal

Intel (INTC) shares jumped Thursday, extending their recent rally on speculation of a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The storied chipmaker has been the subject of discussions involving a potential U.S. chipmaking partnership with TSMC, Baird analysts said Wednesday. TSMC could send engineers to Intel’s foundry business as part of such a venture, and potentially launch a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel that could benefit from U.S. government funding under the Chips Act, the analysts said. Intel’s foundry business has struggled to keep up with TSMC, losing $13.4 billion in 2024. A TSMC spokesperson declined to remark on such a deal, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The discussions come as Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence chips to be designed and manufactured domestically. Policies favoring U.S. chip manufacturers could benefit Intel’s foundry, which makes chips in the U.S. for third parties. Shares of Intel popped over 9% to $24.52 in Thursday afternoon trading and have gained nearly 30% so far this week. However, even with recent gains, the stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 months.
