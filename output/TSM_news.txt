getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Stephen Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities.

To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

Title: Why AMD Is a Much Stronger Investment than Intel (INTC)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio
