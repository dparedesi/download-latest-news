NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”"They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

Title: Nvidia isn’t just building AI chips — it’s building an AI-powered world
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-computex-2025-jensen-huang-ai-taiwan-dgx-spark-1851781267

If you missed Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) keynote at Computex 2025, here’s the short version: AI is no longer just a tool — it’s the infrastructure of the future. Robots, desktops, smart cities, physics engines, and even national computing grids — all of it, Nvidia says, will be built on artificial intelligence. Speaking in Taipei at Asia’s largest electronics expo, CEO Jensen Huang laid out a sweeping vision of the company’s future — one where Nvidia isn’t just enabling AI, it’s helping build a world run by it. Leading the announcements was the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer built for individual developers, researchers, and students. Think of it as a desktop-sized version of Nvidia’s massive Blackwell-based systems, with enough power to train and fine-tune large AI models locally — no cloud access required. It’s the plug-and-play engine for what Huang called “AI-native” users — those who want high-performance AI development at their fingertips. Major OEMs such as Dell (DELL-3.07%), ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, and Gigabyte are already lined up to offer Spark systems tailored for different segments of the market. That’s just one node in Nvidia’s broader push toward what Huang calls “AI factories” — purpose-built computing environments where massive amounts of data are processed and AI-based systems are created, refined, and deployed. To support this expansive vision, Nvidia launched something Huang said was “very special” and “one incredible ingredient” that has been missing: NVLink Fusion, an initiative that allows its GPUs to work seamlessly with third-party CPUs and custom AI chips. That means companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM+0.20%), Fujitsu, Marvell (MRVL-1.67%), and Alchip Technologies can plug into Nvidia’s ecosystem — a notable shift for a company long known for its tightly integrated stacks. “I’ll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing’s for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,” Huang said. But this wasn’t just a cloud-computing conversation. It was one about bringing AI into the physical world. Nvidia doubled down on “physical AI” — the idea that machines should understand and interact with the laws of the real world. Huang talked about Isaac Groot N1 (announced in March), which is a foundational model for robotics that gives humanoid robots the ability to reason, plan, and perceive their surroundings. “The age of generalist robotics has arrived with breakthroughs in mechatronics, physical AI, and embedded computing — just in time as labor shortages limit worldwide industrial growth,” Huang said. One challenge in robotics today is data scarcity, especially high-quality, physical interaction data. Nvidia hopes to answer this problem with Cosmos, a photorealistic simulator that creates synthetic data by observing human behavior in virtual environments. Isaac Groot N1, combined with Cosmos, means developers could now create massive amounts of training data in virtual worlds before rolling out systems in the real one. Developers can now use Groot Dreams — a tool built on Cosmos — to create “future world states,” Huang said, by prompting the model with new tasks and images. This makes it possible to simulate millions of training scenarios before deploying robots in the real world. To help ground those dreams in physical reality, Nvidia will use the recently announced Newton, an open-source physics engine built in collaboration with Google DeepMind (GOOGL-1.57%) and Disney Research (DIS-1.33%) that will be open sourced in July. It’s designed to help AI systems understand real-world dynamics such as gravity, collisions, and torque — bridging the gap between code and physical context. “It’s incredible what it can do,” Huang said. “It’s completely GPU accelerated. It’s differentiable, so you could learn from experience. It is incredibly high fidelity.” Meanwhile, Nvidia is planting deeper roots in Asia with Nvidia Constellation, a new AI-focused hub in Taipei’s Beitou Shilin Science Park. It’s a strategic play — tapping into Taiwan’s world-class semiconductor ecosystem while deepening Nvidia’s presence in the global AI supply chain. Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, attended Huang’s keynote and later told reporters that the city fully supports Nvidia’s plans and is ready to offer whatever help is needed. One of the most strategically significant announcements came near the close of Huang’s keynote: a joint effort to build a national AI supercomputer in Taiwan. Nvidia will partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.63%) (TSMC), Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government to create a cutting-edge AI system for the island. This project aims to integrate AI deeply into urban infrastructure, transforming cities such as Taipei into smart ecosystems powered by advanced computing. The initiative underscores Nvidia’s goal of embedding AI — and thus, its products — into the fabric of daily life, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent public services. Huang’s overall message was unmistakable: AI is no longer just software. It’s infrastructure. It’s automation. It’s everywhere. And Nvidia wants to not only build just the silicon — it wants to build but the systems, the software, and the global footprint to power it all. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
