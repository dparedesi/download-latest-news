ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion — but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Title: Defense And Energy Holdings May Help In New Climate

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A Dassault Rafale C fighter jet. Dassault Aviation is one of 23 stocks currently in my model ... More portfolio. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, with the possibility of retaliation by Iran, poses new risks for U.S. stock investors. With four defense stocks and two energy stocks in my standard portfolio, I feel reasonably well positioned. Once a year in this column, I give a snapshot of my holdings in a typical medium-risk account. My biggest concentration at present is in industrial stocks, most of which are defense stocks. U.S. relations are tense with China, Russia, South Korea and of course Iran. I own Dassault Aviation SA (DUAVF) in France; BAE Systems Plc (BAESY) in Great Britain; and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) in the United States. A quasi-defense holding is Babcock International Group Plc (BCKIY) of Great Britain. Babcock services reactors in nuclear subs, and does other nuclear work. Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (STRL) does engineering and construction, with a specialty in data centers. Its stock is up more than 800% in the past three years. My final industrial holding is Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI), which makes refrigerator coils and other plastic and metal parts. I expect the U.S. stock market to run into some trouble in the next few months, partly because of international strife and rocky federal budget negotiations. Therefore, my second-biggest concentration is in health-care stocks, because the health sector usually holds up pretty well in rough markets. I own Chemed, the largest U.S. hospice operator, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a large insurer and operator of medical practices. In pharmaceuticals, I own Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Sanofi SA (SNY) in France, and Novo Nordisk AS (NVO) in Denmark. I’m fairly light in technology stocks – lighter than I want to be, in fact. Most clients have about 5% of their money in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which makes chips for most major semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom. Also weighing in around 5% is Jabil Inc. (JBL), best known for circuit-board assembly. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is classified as a communications services stock, not a tech stock, but it has an undeniable tech flavor. It is the parent of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. I’ve long been a fan of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), so it’s not surprising that JPMorgan is in my portfolio. I also hold Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc. (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan (which holds a 23% stake in Morgan Stanley). A small holding is First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank Index Fund (QABA), an exchange-traded fund that holds shares in about 100 small and medium-sized banks. I also own Berkshire Hathaway, which is a conglomerate but is classified as a financial stock because of its extensive insurance holdings. This is the domain of Warren Buffett, considered by many the dean of U.S. stock pickers. Buffett has said he will step down as CEO at the end of this year. Among consumer stocks, my biggest holding is Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), the largest U.S. egg producer. I also own Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH), a mid-sized homebuilder in a fragmented industry. Meritage concentrates on the sunbelt, where growth is faster than in the Northeast. Given my concerns about the market, the federal budget deficit, and the fraught international scene, I think it’s prudent to own some gold now. Most of my clients have about 6% of their money in SPDR Gold Share ETF (GLD), which represents a share in a large pool of physical gold. An old favorite sector of mine is energy. Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG) is a pure play on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. TotalEnergies SE (TTE) is the largest oil company in France, and also has significant operations in solar and wind. When I buy a stock, my desired holding period is usually three years or more. But in practice, my average holding period is about two years. Some of the stocks I recommend today will doubtless be out of my portfolio a year hence. In most columns, I include a disclaimer: Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Since today’s column is about the stocks I actually own, I will give my firm’s actual performance (on a composite of individual accounts). In the 25 ¼ years through March 31, we have achieved a cumulative return of 764%, compared to 511% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index. In the 12 months through March 31, however, we trailed the index, 5.35% to 8.25%. Disclosure: I own all 23 stocks recommended in today’s column, both personally and for clients.
