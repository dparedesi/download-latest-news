Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T16:08:27Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Nvidia (NVDA) stock opened the year at about $50 per share (on a split-adjusted basis). As of late November 2024, the AI hardware giant stock's price had eclipsed $145 — that growth equates to a year-to-date market value increase of almost 195%. When one of the world's largest companies nearly triples in value over 11 months, investors take notice. You might naturally wonder if Nvidia will keep growing and, if so, whether you can benefit. To help you decide if you should invest in Nvidia, let's review key factors from the company's last earnings release and the questions you should consider before placing a buy order. Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year. Learn more: Track Nvidia’s stock price here Notably, Nvidia generated nearly 88% of its revenue from its data center reporting segment, which includes the company's AI computing solutions. Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense. Remember that you can always add to your Nvidia holdings once you become comfortable with its behavior.
