We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. On December 10, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar discussed the potential for charging business users thousands of dollars per month for its AI software to better reflect its value. She explained that for users, such as lawyers or academics, AI tools could function like having a highly skilled assistant, making a higher subscription fee reasonable. Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Title: China's top smartphone player is still years behind the U.S.

Despite its comeback to compete with Apple in the Chinese smartphone market, Huawei’s latest smartphone shows it is still years behind, researchers found. In November, the Chinese tech giant launched its Mate 70 smartphone series, including the Mate 70 Pro Plus, which is powered by a Kirin 9020 processor. The chip, however, uses 7-nanometer processing technology — the same process node used in the Mate 60 that it released last August, according to a teardown by researchers at TechInsights. The 7-nanometer process node means Huawei is about 5 years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.70%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia (NVDA-2.57%) and Apple (AAPL+1.13%), which released its first 7-nanometer chip in 2018. In April, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Huawei’s Mate 60 signaled that U.S. export controls on advanced technology “are working because that chip is not nearly as good” and “years behind what we have in the United States.” “We were expecting to find the Kirin 9100 chipset in the Mate 70 line-up,” TechInsights said, adding that China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which manufactures chips for Huawei, was rumored to have used 5-nanometer processing technology for the chip. TSMC, which makes a majority of the world’s advanced chips, has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. Meanwhile, Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process, Bloomberg reported in November. The stalled efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML+1.18%). In October, TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip and found TSMC-made technology — a possible violation of U.S. trade restrictions. At the same time, SMIC is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
