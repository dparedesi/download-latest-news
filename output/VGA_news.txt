That debate will likely remain unsettled for decades. But many achieve their financial goals by prudently investing in safe and reliable dividend stocks and ETFs. About one year ago, a dividend investor shared his success story on /Dividends, a Reddit community of income investors with 600,000 members. The investor said he was 34, served in the air force for 12 years and worked as a defense contractor for four years. Don’t Miss: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how. "I lost my flight status due to medical issues and hated the desk job they gave me. Thanks to having rental properties, I figured it was a good time to move on for the sake of my mental health. Worked out well, because my defense contractor job was amazing ... but with the drawdown we all got laid off this year." The investor, who titled his post “bye-bye work," said he got an 80% VA disability rating, owns several rental income properties and decided to retire early. According to a screenshot of the portfolio the Redditor shared, his portfolio’s total dividend yield was around 4.52%. The investor said his total portfolio worth was $700,000, including non-dividend stocks. He estimated the total worth of his dividend portfolio to be "600’ish." Doing the math based on this dividend yield, the dividend portfolio’s total value is over $620,000. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The investor was repeatedly asked how he achieved this major milestone at the young age of 34. He explained that he had several real estate properties and lived frugally to save up. Answering another question about his achievement, the investor said: "I feel very blessed. I lived very frugally to get here and had quite a bit of luck for real estate timing," he said. Throughout the discussion, the investor emphasized the importance of financial discipline: "I came from poverty and only have a high school diploma. While I served, my favorite thing to do was help other military members appreciate the beauty of financial independence, instead of buying expensive cars at a young age. Putting numbers behind the advice always seems to be that light bulb moment for people." Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. However, it's important to note that he won't be relying entirely on this $2,400-a-month dividend income during his retirement. He said, "most of my money" is in real estate. "I’m already making 25k tax-free from VA disability and 83k pretax from rental income," he added. Let's take a deeper look at the biggest holdings of the investor by examining his dividend portfolio details. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares (VTI) was among the top holdings of the investor. VTI tracks the total stock market, exposing investors to small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. About 69% of the fund is allocated to large-cap stocks. Its portfolio includes more than 3,600 stocks. Among the top holdings of the ETF are Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon. In the comments section of the discussion, someone asked the Redditor for advice. Here's what he said: "Depends on your age. You can’t go wrong with just doing VTI honestly." Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) is another broader market ETF that was part of the investor's portfolio earning $2,400 monthly. However, the investor said his cash-secured put (CSP) option on VOO "didn't turn out as planned." That likely means the investor sold PUT options on VOO, hoping the fund's stock price would stay above the strike price until the option expired. However, the stock price may have fallen below the strike price before the option expired. VOO tracks the S&P 500 index and yields about 1.2%. It pays quarterly dividends. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF Someone asked the Redditor making $2,400 per month in dividends about his biggest positions. He named SCHD among his top picks. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and gives exposure to some of the top dividend stocks trading in the U.S., including Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, Pepsi and AbbVie, among many others. Since SCHD's holdings are mostly conservative dividend payers, it's suitable for investors close to retirement looking for consistent dividend income. Realty Income With a 5% dividend yield and 30 years of consecutive dividend increases, Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) has become a top dividend pick for many investors, especially after the first rate cut. Last month, Scotiabank increased its price target on Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) to $64 from $61 and maintained its Sector Perform rating. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) was a key part of the Redditor's portfolio, earning about $2,400 in monthly dividends. JEPI makes money by investing in large-cap U.S. stocks and selling call options. It is ideal for those looking for exposure to defensive stocks. Altria Group Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) was among the top high-yield dividend stocks in the investor’s portfolio, contributing to the $2,400 a month income. The stock yields over 8% and has gained about 20% this year. Arbor Realty Trust The Redditor said he had a "small amount" of Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) shares in his portfolio. Arbor Realty Trust is a mortgage REIT with a dividend yield of over 11%. WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (NYSE:USFR) invests in U.S. treasuries with floating rates. The fund yields about 5% and pays monthly dividends.

SmartAsset’s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. The current interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through publicly-traded REITs. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. It paid 8.1% in August. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. Looking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

Title: Tech Troubles: Digital Era Downsides (And How To Solve Them)

Advances in technology have introduced revolutionary process and service upgrades for businesses in recent years. Digital tools have enabled remote work and global hiring, streamlined (and sometimes taken over) repetitive processes, improved customer service and outreach, and more. However, progress often comes with pain points, and the growing use of technology in business has raised some serious security, social, ethical and sustainability concerns. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council reflect on some of the downsides of the digital era they’ve observed, as well as why it’s essential to acknowledge and address these issues. The growing use of artificial intelligence is causing a drastic increase in data center power consumption, straining traditional infrastructure and contributing to environmental peril. However, data centers that adopt distributed energy solutions like microgrids can mitigate these issues with localized, sustainable and scalable power, ensuring they remain resilient and energy-efficient in the face of rising AI demands. - Ravi Prasher, Bloom Energy The increasing reliance on technology has notably shortened the attention span of today’s workforce. Establishing dedicated “focus time,” when we deliberately avoid using our devices, can help. Additionally, silencing phones, minimizing nonessential notifications and creating tech-free zones are effective strategies to combat distractions and boost productivity in an ever-connected world. - Batul Bohara, Amazon.com Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? In the race to leverage transformative technologies, it can be easy to lose sight of the critical role only humans can play in the outcomes they deliver. Embracing today’s powerful technologies requires managing the risks they bring, and organizations that rank empathy, critical thinking and creativity among the workforce skills they value will have an edge in meeting these challenges. - Merav Yuravlivker, Data Society Like many, I see the issues with all things related to security, but another big problem is the loss of focus on critical thinking and individual creativity. The rapid evolution of AI has created a vast number of use cases, but that shouldn’t result in the elimination of individual thought. Combining the power of AI technology with experiential human knowledge and creative thought creates more robust solutions more quickly. Foster an environment that embraces combining the power of creative thought with the power of technology. - Johanna Baum, S3 Consulting Business data doubles almost every three years due to advanced technology. The concern is where to go from here. Do we let the data explosion continue freely? There are technologies that can actively delete data and files based on document retention policies and regulations. Such services not only help us manage the volume of data being stored, but can also protect corporations from unnecessary risks in the future. - Kazuhiro Gomi, NTT Research One negative impact of technology’s growth in business is the rise of job displacement due to automation. To address this, companies can invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, empowering workers to adapt to new roles and technologies. This fosters career growth alongside tech advancements. - Tina Gada, Vanguard Group Despite investing billions in software and point solutions, organizations in complex industries (like construction and manufacturing) are plagued by disconnected systems and data. A “one size fits all” approach to technology doesn’t work; instead, look for simple, custom-fit solutions capable of solving problems in a single platform, unlocking the potential of every employee to make an impact. - Ed Jennings, Quickbase The breadth of software modern workers need to get their jobs done and the siloed nature of teams makes IT sprawl a very real problem, contributing to sunken costs and security risks. One way to mitigate this is to look for and choose solutions within your existing business platform. This approach can help organizations better manage identity security, ensuring people have only the access they need to get their work done. - John Milburn, Clear Skye One negative impact of growing tech use is the rise in electronic waste, as businesses frequently upgrade devices. To address this, companies can implement e-waste recycling programs and invest in longer-lasting, repairable technology. Promoting a circular economy reduces environmental harm while fostering a more sustainable tech life cycle. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group One negative impact of growing technology use in business is the rise of employee burnout due to constant connectivity and blurred work-life boundaries. To address this, companies can implement “digital wellness” policies, such as enforcing regular breaks, setting boundaries on after-hours communication and promoting time off to ensure employees can disconnect and recharge effectively. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The digital divide creates a stark gap between those with access to technology and those without, deepening socioeconomic inequalities. Rural areas and low-income communities often face limited access to high-speed internet, devices and digital literacy. To bridge this divide, we must invest in infrastructure, affordable access and education, ensuring equitable opportunities in a rapidly digitizing world. - Vamsi Krishna Dhakshinadhi, GrabAgile Inc. Messaging on Slack and meeting online is undeniably convenient, but I also think it’s overused. As a leader, when I can, I like to meet in person, pick up the phone or use a means of connecting that is even just one degree more “human.” We talk a lot about creating human-centered software, but we can also choose to do without the software and just be human. - Lindsey Witmer Collins, WLCM “Welcome” App Studio As businesses digitize, a key issue is data privacy. The vast amount of personal information collected increases the risk of breaches. To address this, companies should implement privacy-by-design frameworks, encrypt sensitive data and promote transparency in how data is used. This builds customer trust while ensuring compliance with evolving data protection regulations. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech One negative impact of growing technology use is the rise in algorithmic bias, where AI systems unintentionally perpetuate social biases in decision making, from hiring to credit approval. To mitigate this, businesses should implement continuous bias audits and develop explainable AI frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness, while involving diverse teams in the AI development process. - Andrii Kovalchuk, WeSoftYou Inc. A negative impact from the rise of generative AI is that people are accepting its outputs as truth, without question. It’s not always the case that GenAI’s responses are correct. Generative AI creates an answer instead of looking for one—it will sometimes create incorrect answers, and people should be aware of that. - Gonçalo Ribeiro, YData In my sector (public health), many experienced health workers are not tech-savvy. Adding technology tools can help community-based organizations sustainably grow, but for many community health workers, the transition is not easy. It’s difficult but essential to strike a balance between opportunity and sustainable social change. - Syam Adusumilli, GroundGame Health Data intolerance is growing in businesses. Have you ever tried to search an organization’s website for useful information? Good luck. The chronic lack of searchable data strangles productivity, stifles creativity and foments employee burnout. Answers aren’t as simple as “you know, AI” or “get search.” Unbreaking search requires careful, policy-based data planning, executive buy-in and deep technical talent. - James Stanger, CompTIA One downside of the growing use of technology in business is that people tend to become too dependent on it. This makes companies vulnerable when their systems fail or they’re hit with cyberattacks. To minimize risk, businesses should develop effective backup plans, diversify their tech tools to avoid reliance on a single system, and regularly train employees to handle unexpected issues. - Sergii Malomuzh, Rewump
