UPDATED 13:14 EST / JANUARY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing, or EPC — or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. Though artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia Corp. sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10- to 20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore how extreme parallel computing is reshaping the tech landscape, the performance of the major semiconductor players, the competition Nvidia faces, the depth of its moat, and how its software stack cements its leadership. We will also address a recent development from CES — the arrival of so-called “AI PCs” — with data from Enterprise Technology Research. We’ll then look at how the data center market could reach $1.7 trillion by 2035. Finally, we will discuss both the upside potential and the risks that threaten this positive scenario. Our research indicates that every layer of the technology stack — from compute to storage to networking to the software layers — will be re-architected for AI-driven workloads and extreme parallelism. We believe the transition from general-purpose, x86, central processing units toward distributed clusters of graphics processing units and specialized accelerators is happening even faster than many anticipated. What follows is our brief assessment of several layers of the data center tech stack and the implications of EPC. For more than three decades, x86 architectures dominated computing. Today, general-purpose processing is giving way to specialized accelerators. GPUs are the heart of this change. AI workloads such as large language models, natural language processing, advanced analytics and real-time inference demand massive concurrency. While storage is sometimes overlooked in AI conversations, data is the fuel that drives neural networks. We believe AI demands advanced, high-performance storage solutions: With mobile and cloud last decade we saw a shift in network traffic from a north-south trajectory (user-to-data center) toward an east-west bias (server-to-server). AI-driven workloads cause massive east-west and north-south traffic within the data center and across networks. In the world of HPC, InfiniBand emerged as the go-to for ultra-low-latency interconnects. Now, we see that trend permeate hyperscale data centers, with high-performance Ethernet as a dominant standard which will ultimately in our view prove to be the prevailing open network of choice: OS and system-level software Accelerated computing imposes huge demands on operating systems, middleware, libraries, compilers and application frameworks. These must be tuned to exploit GPU resources. As developers create more advanced applications — some bridging real-time analytics and historical data — system-level software must manage concurrency at unprecedented levels. The OS, middleware, tools, libraries and compilers are rapidly evolving to support ultra-parallel workloads with the ability to exploit GPUs (that is, GPU-aware OSes). Data layer Data is the fuel for AI and the data stack is rapidly becoming infused with intelligence. We see the data layer shifting from an historical system of analytics to a real-time engine that supports the creation of real time digital representations of an organization, comprising people, places and things as well as processes. To support this vision, data harmonization via knowledge graphs, unified metadata repositories, agent control frameworks, unified governance and connectors to operational and analytic systems will emerge. The application layer Intelligent applications are emerging that unify and harmonize data. These apps increasingly have real time access to business logic as well as process knowledge. Single-agent systems are evolving to multi-agent architectures with the ability to learn from the reasoning traces of humans. Applications increasingly can understand human language, are injecting intelligence (in other words, AI everywhere) and supporting automation of workflows and new ways of creating business outcomes. Applications increasingly are becoming extensions to the physical world with opportunities in virtually all industries to create digital twins that represent a business in real time. Key takeaway: Extreme parallel computing represents a wholesale rethinking of the technology stack — compute, storage, networking and especially the operating system layer. It places GPUs and other accelerators at the center of the architectural design. The above graphic shows the five-year stock performance of major semiconductor players, with the “AI zone” shaded starting in late 2022 — roughly coinciding with the initial buzz around ChatGPT. Until that timeframe, many were skeptical that large-scale GPU-accelerated AI would become such a powerful business driver. In our view, the market has recognized that semiconductors are the foundation of future AI capabilities, awarding premium multiples to companies that can capture accelerated compute demand. This year, the “haves” (led by Nvidia, Broadcom and AMD) are outperforming, while the “have-nots” (in particular, Intel) are lagging. Nvidia’s 65% operating margins have enticed investors and competitors to enter the AI chip market in droves. Both incumbents and new entrants have responded aggressively. Yet the market potential is so large and Nvidia’s lead is so substantial that in our view, near-term competition will not hurt Nvidia. Nonetheless, we see multiple angles regarding Nvidia’s challengers, each with its own market approach. We align these two leaders because: 1) Broadcom powers custom chips such as Google’s tensor processing units or TPUs; and 2) We believe that TPU v4 is extremely competitive in AI. Broadcom’s IP around SerDes, optics and networking is best-in-class and together with Google represents in our view the most viable technical alternative relative to Nvidia. Importantly, Broadcom also has had a long-term relationship with Meta and powers its AI chips. Both Google and Meta have proved that AI return on investment in consumer advertising pays off. While many enterprises struggle with AI ROI, these two firms are demonstrating impressive return on invested capital from AI. Both Google and Meta are leaning into Ethernet as a networking standard. Broadcom is a strong supporter of Ethernet and a leading voice in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Moreover, Broadcom is the only company other than Nvidia with proven expertise on networking within and across XPUs and across XPU clusters, making the company an extremely formidable competitor in AI silicon. AMD’s data center strategy hinges on delivering competitive AI accelerators — building on the company’s track record in x86. Though it has a serious GPU presence for gaming and HPC, the AI software ecosystem (centered on CUDA) remains a key obstacle. AMD has made aggressive moves in AI. It is aligning with Intel to try to keep x86 viability alive. It has acquired ZT Systems to better understand end-to-end AI systems requirements and will be a viable alternative of merchant silicon, especially for inference workloads. Ultimately we believe AMD will capture a relatively small share (single digits) of a massive market. It will manage x86 market declines by gaining share against Intel and make inroads into cost sensitive AI chip markets against Nvidia. Once the undisputed leader in processors, Intel’s fortunes have turned amid the shift toward accelerated compute. We continue to see Intel hampered by the massive capital requirements of retaining its own foundry. Amazon’s custom silicon approach has succeeded with Graviton in CPU instances. Its acquisition of Annapurna Labs is one of the best investments in the history of enterprise tech. And certainly it’s one that is often overlooked. Today, AWS works with Marvell and is applying a Graviton-like strategy to GPUs with Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference). Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon’s GPU sums it up in our view. Here’s what he said on a recent episode of the BG2 pod: Amazon, their whole thing at re:Invent, if you really talk to them when they announce Trainium 2 and our whole post about it and our analysis of it is supply chain-wise… you squint your eyes, This looks like a Amazon Basics TPU, right? It’s decent, right? But it’s really cheap, A; and B, it gives you the most HBM capacity per dollar and most HBM memory bandwidth per dollar of any chip on the market. And therefore it actually makes sense for certain applications to use. And so this is like a real shift. Like, hey, we maybe can’t design as well as Nvidia, but we can put more memory on the package. [Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon Trainium] Our view is that AWS’ offering will be cost-optimized — and offer an alternative GPU approach within the AWS ecosystem for both training an inference. Though developers ultimately may prefer the familiarity and performance of Nvidia’s platform, AWS will offer as many viable choices to customers as it can and will get a fair share of its captive market. Probably not the penetration it sees with Graviton relative to merchant x86 silicon but a decent amount of adoption to justify the investment. We don’t have a current forecast for Trainium at this time, but it’s something we’re watching to get better data. Microsoft has historically lagged AWS and Google in custom silicon, though it does have ongoing projects, such as Maia. Microsoft can offset any silicon gap with its software dominance and willingness to pay Nvidia’s margins for high-end GPUs. Qualcomm is a key supplier for Microsoft client devices. Qualcomm, as indicated, competes in mobile and edge, but as robotics and distributed AI applications expand, we see potential for more direct clashes with Nvidia. Firms such as Cerebras Systems Inc., SambaNova Systems Inc., Tenstorrent Inc. and Graphcore Ltd. have introduced specialized AI architectures. China is also developing homegrown GPU or GPU-like accelerators. However, the unifying challenge remains software compatibility, developer momentum and the steep climb to dislodge a de facto standard. Key takeaway: Though competition is strong, none of these players alone threatens Nvidia’s long-term dominance — unless Nvidia makes significant missteps. The market’s size is vast enough that multiple winners can thrive. We see Nvidia’s competitive advantage as a multifaceted moat spanning hardware and software. It has taken nearly two decades of systematic innovation to produce an integrated ecosystem that is both broad and deep. Nvidia’s GPUs employ advanced process nodes, including HBM memory integration and specialized tensor cores that deliver huge leaps in AI performance. Notably, Nvidia can push a new GPU iteration every 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile, it uses “whole cow” methods — ensuring that every salvageable die has a place in its portfolio (data center, PC GPUs or automotive). This keeps yields high and margins healthy. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. put Nvidia in control of InfiniBand, enabling it to sell comprehensive end-to-end systems for AI clusters and get to market quickly. The integration of ConnectX and BlueField DPUs extends Nvidia’s leadership in ultra-fast networking, a critical component for multi-GPU scaling. As the industry moves toward the Ultra Ethernet standard, many see this as a threat to Nvidia’s moat. We do not. Though networking is a critical component of Nvidia’s time to market advantage, we see it as a supporting member of its portfolio. In our view, the company can and will successfully optimize its stack for Ethernet as the market demands; and it will maintain its core advantage, which comes from tight integration across its stack. Nvidia’s software ecosystem has grown far beyond CUDA to include frameworks for nearly every stage of AI application development. The net result is that developers have more reason to stay within Nvidia’s ecosystem rather than seeking alternatives. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, has frequently underscored the company’s emphasis on building a partner network. Virtually every major tech supplier and cloud provider offers Nvidia-based instances or solutions. That broad footprint generates significant network effects, reinforcing the moat. Key takeaway: Nvidia’s advantage does not hinge on chips alone. Its integration of hardware and software — underpinned by a vast ecosystem — forms a fortress-like moat that is difficult to replicate. CUDA rightly dominates the software discussion, but Nvidia’s stack is broad. Below we highlight six important layers: CUDA, NVMI/NVSM (here denoted as “NIMS”), Nemo, Omniverse, Cosmos and Nvidia’s developer libraries/toolkits. Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA is Nvidia’s foundational parallel computing platform. It abstracts away the complexities of GPU hardware and allows developers to write applications in languages like C/C++, Fortran, Python and others. CUDA orchestrates GPU cores and optimizes workload scheduling for accelerated AI, HPC, graphics and more. NIMS focuses on infrastructure-level management: monitoring, diagnostics, workload scheduling and overall hardware health in large-scale GPU clusters. Not strictly a “developer tool,” it is nonetheless critical for any enterprise that needs to run advanced AI workloads on thousands of GPUs. NeMo is an end-to-end framework for developing and fine-tuning large language models and natural language applications. It provides pre-built modules, pre-trained models, and the tooling to export those models into other Nvidia products, helping speed time to insight for businesses that want to leverage NLP and large language models. Omniverse is a platform for 3D design collaboration, simulation and real-time visualization. While originally showcased for design engineering and media, Omniverse now extends into robotics, digital twins and advanced physics-based simulations. It leverages CUDA for graphical rendering, combining real-time graphics with AI-driven simulation capabilities. Cosmos is Nvidia’s distributed computing framework that streamlines the building and training of massive AI models. By integrating with the firm’s networking solutions and HPC frameworks, Cosmos helps scale compute resources horizontally. It allows researchers and developers to unify hardware resources for large-scale training in a more seamless manner. Beyond the core frameworks, Nvidia has developed hundreds of specialized libraries for neural network operations, linear algebra, device drivers, HPC applications, image processing and more. These libraries are meticulously tuned for GPU acceleration — further locking in the developer community that invests time to master them. Key takeaway: The software stack is arguably the most important factor in Nvidia’s sustained leadership. CUDA is only part of the story. The depth and maturity of Nvidia’s broader AI software suite forms a formidable barrier to entry for new challengers. Although this Breaking Analysis focuses on data center transformation, we would be remiss not to discuss AI PCs briefly. At CES this year, multiple vendors announced laptops and desktops branded as “AI PCs,” often featuring NPUs (neural processing units) or specialized GPUs for on-device inference. Survey data shown above is from ETR in a survey of approximately 1,835 information technology decision makers. The vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum and the horizontal axis is Overlap or penetration within those 1,835 accounts. The table insert shows how the dots are plotted (Net Score and N). It shows Dell laptops at the top of the share curve with 543 N, with strong spending momentum across Apple, HP, and Lenovo. The plot reveals healthy spending momentum for leading PC suppliers. Currently, the NPU often sits idle in many AI PCs because software stacks are still not fully optimized. Over time, we expect more specialized AI applications on client devices — potentially enabling real-time language translation, image/video processing, advanced security and local LLM inference at smaller scales. We believe Nvidia, with its track record in GPUs, can offer AI PC technology that is more performant than typical NPUs on mobile or notebooks. However, the power consumption, thermals, and cost constraints remain significant challenges. We do see Nvidia using salvaged “whole cow” dies and building them into laptop GPUs with reduced power envelopes. Although this section deviates from the data center focus, AI PCs could drive developer adoption. On-device AI makes sense for productivity, specialized workloads, and specific vertical use cases. This, in turn, may reinforce the broader ecosystem transition to parallel computing architectures. We have modeled the entire data center market — servers, storage, networking, power, cooling and related infrastructure — from 2019 through 2035. Our research points to a rapid transition away from traditional general-purpose computing toward extreme parallel computing. We categorize “extreme parallel computing” as the specialized hardware and software for AI training, inference, HPC clusters and advanced analytics. Currently, we estimate that Nvidia accounts for roughly 25% of the entire data center segment. Our view is that Nvidia will retain that leading share throughout the forecast period — assuming it avoids unforced errors — despite intense competition from hyperscalers, AMD and others. Key takeaway: The anticipated shift toward accelerated compute forms the foundation of our bullish stance on data center growth. We believe extreme parallel computing ushers in a multi-year (or even multi-decade) supercycle for data center infrastructure investments. We assert that a new trillion-dollar-plus marketplace is emerging, fueled by AI. The data center — as we have known it — will transform into a distributed, parallel processing fabric where GPUs and specialized accelerators become the norm. Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform (hardware + software + ecosystem) leads this transition, but it is not alone. Hyperscalers, competing semiconductor firms, and specialized startups all have roles to play in a rapidly expanding market. Despite our positive assessment, we acknowledge several risks: Final word: Nvidia’s future looks bright, in our view, but it cannot be complacent. The company’s best defense remains relentless innovation in both hardware and software — a strategy that has carried it to where it is today and will likely drive its continued leadership in this new era of extreme parallel computing.

U.S. Department of the Treasury January 10, 2025 New energy sector determination targets Russia's primary revenue source with sanctions against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, more than 180 vessels, and dozens of oil traders, oilfield service providers, insurance companies, and energy officials WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury took sweeping action to fulfill the G7 commitment to reduce Russian revenues from energy, including blocking two major Russian oil producers. Today's actions also impose sanctions on an unprecedented number of oil-carrying vessels, many of which are part of the "shadow fleet," opaque traders of Russian oil, Russia-based oilfield service providers, and Russian energy officials. Today's actions are underpinned by the issuance of a new determination that authorizes sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 against persons operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. These actions substantially increase the sanctions risks associated with the Russian oil trade. The United Kingdom (UK) is also taking action today, joining Treasury in sanctioning two major Russian oil producers. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine," said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. "This action builds on, and strengthens, our focus since the beginning of the war on disrupting the Kremlin's energy revenues, including through the G7+ price cap launched in 2022. With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports." The Department of State is also taking steps to reduce Russia's energy revenues by blocking two active liquefied natural gas projects, a large Russian oil project, and third-country entities supporting Russia's energy exports. State is also designating numerous Russia-based oilfield service providers and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom. Today, the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State are taking action to further implement commitments made by G7 leaders to reduce Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, issued a determination pursuant to E.O. 14024 that authorizes the imposition of sanctions on any person determined to operate or have operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. This new determination strengthens the ability of Treasury and State to target revenueâin particular, revenue generated from the export of oilâthat Russia uses to fuel its brutal war against Ukraine and other harmful foreign activities. Additionally, Treasury issued amended General License 8L, which authorizes certain wind-down transactions related to energy through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 12, 2025. The narrowing authorization for transactions related to Russian energy further reduces Russia's ability to leverage this sector and fund its war machine. Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, issued a new determination pursuant to E.O. 14071 prohibiting the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, cutting off Russia's access to U.S. services related to the extraction and production of crude oil and other petroleum products. The prohibition takes effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 27, 2025. Pursuant to today's determination, OFAC designated two of Russia's most significant oil producers and exporters pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft (Gazprom Neft) is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. Surgutneftegas is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. The UK is also sanctioning Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas today. Alongside Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, OFAC is designating more than two dozen Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, or their subsidiaries listed today, are also subject to blocking, even if not identified by OFAC. For more information on the Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries targeted today, please see Annex 1. Russia has grown increasingly reliant on vessels that participate in high-risk shipping practices to facilitate illicit or sanctionable activity, often called the "shadow fleet." Today's action sanctions 183 vessels, largely oil tankers that are part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators. Several of the vessels sanctioned today have shipped not only Russian oil, but also sanctioned Iranian oil. OFAC is also sanctioning two Russia-based maritime insurance providers, Ingosstrakh Insurance Company and Alfastrakhovanie Group, which were previously sanctioned by the UK. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2. Similarly, Russia's dependence on opaque traders willing to ship and sell its oil has dramatically increased. These traders often are registered in high-risk jurisdictions, have murky corporate structures and personnel with links to Russia, and conceal their business activities. Many were only established in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and quickly began moving hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Russian oil within months of their creation. OFAC has previously sanctioned such traders and is taking further action today by sanctioning opaque traders and a shadowy Government of Russia-linked network facilitating massive amounts of oil exports. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3. Russia's domestic oil industry is supported by providers with critical specialized services that enable producers to keep oil flowing from wells and provide technical know-how and equipment to allow oil producers to access challenging reserves. In addition to the determination described above that prohibits the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, today's action sanctions more than 30 Russia-based oilfield service providers. Additionally, OFAC is sanctioning more than a dozen leading Russian energy officials and executives, including the CEOs of a number of Russian oil producers. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 4. The following Russia-based entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: The following entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13662 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gazprom Neft: The following Russia-based entities are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: Joint Stock Company Surgutneftegasbank (SNGB) is a Russia-based commercial bank.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Title: Wall Street Banks Cleared by Texas AG After Leaving NZBA

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
