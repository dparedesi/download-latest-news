August 20, 2025 09:53 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, will launch a digital, blockchain-powered platform in early 2026, designed to expand its entertainment ecosystem far beyond the stage and into the hands, homes, and dashboards of music fans everywhere. The platform will introduce tokenized digital memberships, fan rewards, and soft ticketing services, marking VENU’s entry into the fast-emerging world of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The technology will leverage blockchain infrastructure to deliver secure, flexible, and immersive experiences, redefining how fans access, own, and interact with live music and events. “VENU intends to own the narrative around digital engagement with fans, dramatically improving live-streamed entertainment while unlocking totally new experiences for fan ownership,” said J.W. Roth, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of VENU. The announcement comes as VENU aggressively scales its physical venue footprint. Roth confirmed the Company’s near-term and long-term vision, “With the opening of three new amphitheaters in 2026 and a target of 25 amphitheaters and 15 indoor entertainment complexes by 2030, we will own over 350,000 seats, which should equate to over 20 million annual tickets sold with over $2 billion in gross ticket sales volume.” That level of ticketing volume positions VENU as one of the largest players in U.S. live entertainment, behind only the publicly traded national operator known for its massive touring footprint, and a leading secondary market platform that just refiled its IPO prospectus last week at a rumored $16.5 billion valuation, a move puts live entertainment squarely back in Wall Street’s spotlight. Roth emphasized that VENU’s blockchain initiative is not simply a tech bolt-on but a core part of its forward strategy. “One of the most exciting opportunities in financial technology is ‘real world asset’ tokenization – the opportunity to use a technology wrapper to bring tangible goods or services to the blockchain, supercharging their utility. The first use-case to achieve product-market fit were dollar-backed stablecoins; today, there are more than $250 billion in circulation. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said on CNBC this month that ‘tokenization is an innovation,’ and we agree. The next step could be the tokenization of new types of assets, and at VENU we see an opportunity to potentially tokenize our seats, our soft ticketing platform, and our overall fan experiences.” By combining blockchain with its growing network of physical venues, VENU is positioning itself as a disruptive force in both the live entertainment and digital media industries. “A blockchain-powered soft ticket experience should significantly increase overall ticket sales while inviting a much larger audience to enjoy unique and invaluable live experiences within the VENU ecosystem,” Roth added. “As our VENU network grows, a digital engagement layer can unify benefits across our properties, reduce friction in soft ticketing and rewards, and create a direct channel to our superfans and partners. I believe this will catapult VENU into becoming a global distributor of live music.” With growing institutional interest, including a recent disclosure from Vanguard Group showing a new 861,911-share position, and a digital strategy aligned with future-forward trends, VENU is quickly becoming one of the most exciting public stories in the intersection of entertainment, real estate, and blockchain innovation. VENU plans to provide further updates as discussions progress and definitive agreements are reached. Please click here to read Cenorium’s full Venu analyst report on 247marketnews.com.

August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner.
