Citron Research founder Andrew Left analyzes the state of the U.S. market and the wider economy on 'The Claman Countdown.' Warren Buffett is helping revive shares of beleaguered UnitedHealthcare Group after taking a $1.6 billion stake in the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. UnitedHealth shares clocked the largest one-day percent increase since March 2020, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. It was on pace for the best day in 17 years before giving back some of those gains. For the week, shares rose over 21%, the best week since May 2009. Still, the stock is down more than 50% over the past 12 months. Investors, taking a cue from Buffett’s interest in healthcare, also piled into Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares and The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(Photographer: Houston Cofield/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is known for taking positions in businesses it believes will perform over the long term and that have become, in some cases, undervalued. The healthcare giant has been plagued by a Department of Justice probe and the fallout from the fatal shooting of executive Brian Thompson outside the Midtown Hilton Hotel in New York City last year. The brazen killing turned a critical spotlight onto the nation’s healthcare insurance system. Luigi Mangione has been charged with murdering Thompson.

Title: 24/7 Market News: "Our Pipeline Is Roaring" VENU Breaks Out and Expanding National Footprint

August 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that momentum is rapidly building around Venu Holding Corporation (NYSE American: VENU)(“VENU”), a developer and operator of premium live music amphitheaters and hospitality destinations, announced its Q2 2025 financial results, after yesterday’s market close, during an earnings call that highlighted a surge in asset growth, record fan engagement, and expanded national momentum. “As we close out his quarter, we’re seeing the pieces come together, for what’s going to be a defining moment in our growth history. While our attention, this quarter, has heavily been on our balance sheet, it’s all with the P&L in mind,” exclaimed J.W. Roth, VENU’s Founder, Chairman & CEO. Roth later stated, “Here’s the deal, our growth is guided by four clear priorities. First, expanding our markets across the nation. Second, bringing current developments over the finish line and packing their calendars with great content. Third, growing our FireSuite sales with a focus on high impact triple net transactions that go straight on to our balance sheet. And finally, unlocking strategic value, through high value opportunities, like naming rights and sale lease backs.” Financial and Strategic Highlights: The Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs hosted 35,000+ fans across its first 10 shows this season, generating $4.7 million in gross receipts with an average ticket price of $135. Net revenue from amphitheater operations and naming rights totaled $597,712 for the quarter. Development Pipeline and Capital Strategy: “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area. To accelerate these agreements, we have a strong partnership with industry leader, Ryan, LLC. This three-year partnership is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter and, on average, we can expect to add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet, with each delivered development agreement.” Additionally, VENU’s triple-net lease partnership with Sands Investment Group, announced in May, has exceeded expectations, with demand far surpassing initial forecasts. Based on early momentum, the program is projected to generate over $100 million in additional annual capital, creating a powerful new revenue stream alongside traditional FireSuite sales. “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund all of our expansion; partially through public private partnerships, partially through the sale of our FireSuites, and then toward the end of every project, the sale leaseback of the ground underneath the development. The current opportunity is intended to complete the financing of our entire project and will likely result in a development profit,” said Roth. “We have been presented with a significant opportunity to activate sale leaseback sale opportunities. Once completed and accepted, the current one is expected to generate $188 million and a development profit of roughly $35 million in the fourth quarter of this year, with another $35 million expected in the fourth quarter of 2026.” Institutional Confidence Is Rising: Vanguard Makes Its Move With a current market capitalization exceeding $600 million, VENU is officially no longer a micro-cap, marking a transformative milestone that opens the door to increased institutional ownership, broader analyst coverage, and potential inclusion in small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600. One of the clearest signs of VENU’s growing credibility on Wall Street is that Vanguard Group, one of the world’s largest asset managers, disclosed a new position in VENU. According to its Q2 2025 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Vanguard now holds 861,911 shares, representing approximately 2.3% of VENU’s outstanding stock, with a market value of about $13 million. Vanguard becomes one of the first two major institutions to establish a position in VENU, paving the way for what is likely to be many more, as this development significantly broadens the potential investor base to include many mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance company portfolios. “If Q2 proved anything, it’s that the foundation is set and we are roaring ahead. The fans are getting what they always deserved, our model is working, municipalities are hungry, momentum is real and the market is ours to take. In closing, everything that we’ve been working on is pointing to a development profit in the fourth quarter of this year and operationally profit in the third quarter/fourth quarter of 2026,” Roth added. Strategic Partnerships Driving Scale: Roth concluded, “The future that we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months and, if Q2 is any sign, we’ve laid the foundation for things to come.” A replay of the call is available through August 14, 2026, at: https://investors.venu.live.

August 13, 2025 08:49 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that momentum is rapidly building around Venu Holding Corporation (NYSE American: VENU), as institutional investors take notice of the company’s disruptive approach to entertainment venues and fan engagement. Notably, Vanguard Group reported a new position in Venu during the second quarter of 2025, holding 861,911 shares, representing approximately 2.3% of VENU’s outstanding stock, with a current market value of around $13 million, according to its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest asset managers underscores growing institutional belief in VENU’s long-term growth strategy. In tandem with Vanguard’s stake, VENU also announced the closing of a $10.125 million equity investment from Aramark, in the second quarter, further validating the company's model through strategic capital infusion and operational alignment. This marks a major milestone as Aramark Sports + Entertainment becomes VENU’s exclusive provider of food, beverage, retail, and facility operations for its flagship Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, as well as the forthcoming Sunset Amphitheaters in Texas and Oklahoma. Shared Vision: Fan-First Philosophy VENU and Aramark share a deep commitment to enhancing the guest experience. With VENU’s “fan-founded” philosophy focused on upscale, immersive, and locally inspired venues, Aramark brings decades of excellence in hospitality across NFL stadiums, MLB ballparks, NCAA championship events, and major cultural attractions. “Venu’s ‘fan-founded’ philosophy aligns perfectly with our commitment to creating unforgettable experiences,” said Alison Birdwell, CEO of Aramark Sports + Entertainment. “We’re proud to partner with a company that’s redefining what live entertainment can look and feel like.” From VIP suites and chef-driven dining to mobile ordering and AI-powered menu optimization, the collaboration is engineered to deliver seamless, high-impact experiences that drive both brand loyalty and per-capita revenue. Scaling with Precision: 20+ Venues in the Pipeline As VENU targets the opening of 20+ smart venues over the next 48–60 months, operational scalability becomes essential. Aramark’s ability to manage large-scale venues, already servicing 300+ sports and entertainment locations, makes it an ideal logistics partner. Their capabilities include: VENU’s venues, featuring app-connected systems, temperature-controlled seating, and AI-powered analytics, will be further enhanced by Aramark’s cutting-edge tools like mobile kiosks, dynamic staffing, and real-time guest insights. A Localized, Branded Experience VENU’s strategy of building destination venues rooted in local identity is bolstered by Aramark’s expertise in integrating regional chefs, craft beverage partners, and local flavors into large-scale hospitality programs. This complements VENU’s existing collaborations with industry icons like Troy Aikman’s EIGHT Elite Light Lager, AEG Presents, and Ford.
