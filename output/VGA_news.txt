“If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” — General Dwight D. Eisenhower, undelivered statement, June 5, 1944 The message was never broadcast. Never printed. Never heard. And yet it remains one of the most remarkable documents of World War II—a plain slip of paper, scribbled in pencil, misdated “July 5,” and folded into a shirt pocket by a man shouldering the weight of freedom’s gamble. Had D-Day failed—had the beaches been bloodbaths without a breakthrough—General Dwight D. Eisenhower was prepared to take full responsibility. Not with a press conference or a military tribunal. But with a handwritten note accepting all blame. Not naming subordinates. Not mentioning the enemy. Not even attempting an explanation. He wrote, “The troops, the air, and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” That was the kind of man Eisenhower was. Born in Texas, raised in Abilene, Kansas, with a manner as unassuming as the plains that shaped him, Eisenhower was not the most obvious military commander in an age of brash tacticians and battlefield showmen. His pre-war career, by many accounts, was unremarkable. He had never commanded troops in battle. He spent much of his time as a staff officer—drafting plans, supervising training, and writing reports that bore the names of others. Promotions came slowly. But behind the scenes, he was absorbing everything—men, method, machinery, and morale. And yet, by June 1944, he stood at the helm of the largest seaborne invasion in human history—nearly 160,000 troops, thousands of ships, and more than 11,000 aircraft ready to hurl the full force of the free world across Hitler’s Atlantic wall. He did not blink. There is a certain fog of war that touches everything within its reach. In victory—and with the passage of time and now generations—the line of sight begins to crystallize. But clarity can be deceptive. We often miss what was obscured in the moment. Eighty-one years on, it is easy to forget just how precarious it all was. One bad decision—one shift in weather, one error in judgment—and the free world might have faltered. That burden, in full, fell to Eisenhower. Ike’s genius was not in dramatic field movements or thunderous oratory. It was in orchestration. He held together an alliance that strained at every seam—British doubt, French suspicion, American impatience, and a chorus of generals with differing agendas, stratagems, and personalities that often started but rarely ended in agreement. Montgomery wanted more troops—and headlines. Patton wanted more risk—but more than anything, he wanted to be the tip of the spear. Churchill, ever cautious about casualties and continental commitments, wanted assurance. Stalin—relentless in his demands and ruthless in his aims, but for the moment an ally—wanted action. Eisenhower gave them unity. By sheer will and balance, he united the Western Allies into a single force—British divisions, American battalions, Canadian armor, Free French brigades, and resistance networks, all united by a single banner: freedom. He soothed egos without surrendering ground. He absorbed political pressure without compromising military clarity. And when it came time to choose the day—when tides and moonlight and cloud cover all collided in a narrow 24-hour window of fate—he made the call. The hour was now. That was the feeling in the room—the moment of decision had come, and there would be no turning back. On the night of June 5, he walked the flight line of the 101st Airborne, shaking hands with paratroopers who would jump into the dark and likely never walk again. He asked their names. They joked about their gear. Patted shoulders and posed for a photo that would become a legend. These were not staged moments. He knew what he was asking—and what it might cost. But they could see it in his face—the weight, the gravity, the burden of command. Men started to pipe up, trying to cut the tension: “Quit worrying, General. We’ll take care of this thing for you.” Years later, Eisenhower admitted he might have had tears in his eyes as he walked away. “Well, I don’t know about that,” he told Walter Cronkite with a faint smile, “but it could’ve been possible.” And then he added what only a man who had borne it could say: “The hours before a major battle is joined are the most terrible time for a senior commander. You know the losses are going to be bad. And goodness knows, those fellas meant a lot to me.” They were the vanguard of victory, and the burden to go or to wait fell to him—and him alone. Eisenhower also knew what the enemy expected. For months, the Germans had been watching the wrong man. In a feat of military deception worthy of Shakespeare and Sun Tzu, the Allies had crafted Operation Fortitude—a two-pronged campaign of illusion. Fortitude South conjured the ghost of an invasion force: the First U.S. Army Group, a fictitious formation that had begun as an administrative shell under General Omar Bradley—then, quite plausibly, grown to full strength under the command of General George S. Patton. With inflatable tanks, scripted radio traffic, and headquarters near Dover, this phantom army appeared ready to strike at Calais. Meanwhile, Fortitude North hinted at a second blow aimed at Norway. The Germans believed it all. And so they held back their strongest units—waiting for an attack that would never come. And Hitler bought it. The real invasion came across the Normandy beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Some landings were light. Others were infernos. At Omaha, entire companies were cut down before they reached the shingle. The sea ran red; the air was thick with sand and steel. But they pushed forward—over bluffs, through hedgerows, into history. That morning, Eisenhower received reports that suggested catastrophe. He kept his calm amid chaos. Chain-smoking, scanning maps, resisting premature triumph or despair. When the tide turned and beachheads were secured, he didn’t celebrate. He ordered the next phase. There was no time for indulgence. Because Eisenhower knew what followed. D-Day was not the end. It was the breach—a crack in the fortress of tyranny, made possible by those who leaped, climbed, crawled, and bled. And at the center of it all was a man prepared to shoulder the blame—one reason he was so well suited to carry the burden of victory. Years later, on the windswept cliffs above Omaha Beach, Eisenhower stood beside Walter Cronkite and reflected on the events of D-Day. He humbly deflected credit, emphasizing that it was the bravery and initiative of the American G.I.s that secured victory. But he left out the indispensable truth: they did it—because he led them. That was all, and it was enough. Charlton Allen is an attorney and former chief executive officer and chief judicial officer of the North Carolina Industrial Commission.

Title: Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborate on shared threat actor mapping system

UPDATED 18:37 EDT / JUNE 02 2025 by Duncan Riley CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Microsoft Corp. today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at resolving the longstanding confusion in how cyberthreat actors are identified and tracked across security platforms. The partnership establishes a shared mapping system that aligns adversary attribution across both companies’ threat intelligence ecosystems, eliminating ambiguity caused by inconsistent naming. The problem that both companies are trying to solve is one encountered commonly in cybersecurity news: various companies applying their own name to threat actors, making it sometimes difficult for observers to know what threat actor and ransomware group one report to another is talking about. For example, the well-known Cozy Bear hacking group is also known as Midnight Blizzard, depending on which company is writing the report, which doesn’t exactly make intelligence tracking easy when different names are used. To their credit, CrowdStrike and Microsoft can see the problem and have developed a “Rosetta Stone” for cyber threat intelligence, one that links adversary identifiers across vendor ecosystems without mandating a single naming standard. The idea is that by reducing ambiguity in how adversaries are labeled, the mapping enables defenders to make faster, more confident decisions, correlate threat intelligence across sources and better disrupt threat actor activity before it causes harm. “This is a watershed moment for cybersecurity. Adversaries hide behind both technology and the confusion created by inconsistent naming,” Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, said in a media release. “As defenders, it’s our job to stay ahead and to give security teams clarity on who is targeting them and how to respond.” The collaboration will start with a shared analyst-led effort to harmonize adversary naming between CrowdStrike and Microsoft’s threat research teams. Although only announced today, the companies have already “deconflicted” more than 80 adversaries, including validating threat actors like Microsoft’s Volt Typhoon and CrowdStrike’s VANGUARD PANDA are allegedly Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and that Secret Blizzard and VENOMOUS BEAR refer to the same Russia-nexus adversary. Moving forward, CrowdStrike and Microsoft plan to continue working together to expand this effort, inviting other partners to contribute to and maintain a shared threat actor mapping resource for the global cybersecurity community. “Cybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time, especially in today’s AI-driven era,” said Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security. “Microsoft and CrowdStrike are in ideal positions to help our customers and the wider defender community accelerate the benefits of actionable threat intelligence. Security is a team sport and when defenders can share and react to information faster it makes a difference in how we protect the world.” THANK YOU Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 8 MINS AGO Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters INFRA - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 23 MINS AGO Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform CLOUD - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 HOUR AGO
