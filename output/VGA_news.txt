Title: Conor McGregor Inc: the fighter’s potential losses in the fallout from civil rape case are enormous

When a High Court jury found against Conor McGregor in his civil rape case last week, the Hollywood Reporter jumped on the story of his legal woes. The coverage in the US film industry’s go-to news publication was as big a sign as any of McGregor’s seemingly unstoppable journey into the ritzy world of entertainment from the bloodied mixed martial arts octagon. Now he is counting the cost of what he did on that December 2018 day in the penthouse suite of the Beacon Hotel in Sandyford, south Dublin. His potential losses in the fallout from the case are enormous. This was shaping up to a big year for McGregor. But that was before Nikita Hand told a believing jury of a terrifying sexual assault by a professional fighter who “would not take no for an answer”. The Dublin woman was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages after the jury found that she was raped by McGregor in the Dublin hotel in December 2018. McGregor (36) owns three Dublin pubs: the Black Forge Inn and the Marble Arch in Drimnagh, and the Waterside in Howth, where plans for a boutique hotel were rejected by Fingal County Council. But he always wanted to stride on a bigger stage – and did so with alacrity. [ Conor McGregor was facilitated by a culture of entitlement and cheered on by adoring fansOpens in new window ] He made his Hollywood debut in March, starring in the move Road House with A-list actor Jake Gyllenhaal. In June he struck a new deal to use his image in the Hitman video game, a global franchise. He continued to promote Proper No. Twelve, the whiskey brand he sold three years ago for $130 million (€123 million) and was on a drive to create international markets for his Forged Stout brand. The sales slogan said much about his ambition for the new brew: “Better watch out, because we’re not here to take part, we’re here to take over.” It echoes McGregor’s famous line from his post-fight octagon interview at UFC Fight Night Dublin in 2014, when he was at the vanguard of a number of Irish fighters appearing on the promotion. Now it is events that have taken over, threatening an empire that traded on McGregor’s ability to connect directly with a certain cohort of young men with an almost cult-like appeal. Ms Hand’s account of how McGregor “brutally raped and battered her” has dealt a crippling blow to his earning power. Retailers are taking McGregor drink from their shelves – and his image has been pulled from whiskey marketing and video games. His childhood soccer team in Crumlin, Lourdes Celtic, is said locally to be removing his name from players’ kit but the club itself did not reply to questions. Even the National Wax Museum has removed his sculpture. Forged Stout was sold in off-licences and supermarkets and a relatively small number of pubs so the delisting inflicts financial pain. However, for the McGregor brand the real money was in the US. There could be serious implications there too. “Financially, and then [in terms of] future revenue generating, it’s very damaging for him,” said Prof Norm O’Reilly, author of 20 books on sports sponsorship and dean of the University of New England business school. “I would say for most brands this is now like a hands-off, certainly in the very short term. It doesn’t look good. It’s about images. Image transfer is the core of why sponsorship works. He added: “If you and I own a company and we’re trying to be a little edgy, he’s no longer our choice, right?” There are “many other athletes out there who have a bit of edge” but who haven’t “done something like this to women”, said Prof O’Reilly. McGregor was in full plumage when he claimed to be “the highest-paid first-time actor of all time” for his villain role in Road House, an action thriller remake of a 1980s blockbuster that starred the late Patrick Swayze. He is said to have received $5 million for the role, prompting his claim to have been paid more than wrestler-turned Hollywood star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson when he burst on to the screen decades ago. Nikita Hand has won her civil case against MMA fighter Conor McGregor. The 35 year-old Dublin woman alleged he raped her in the penthouse suite of The Beacon Hotel in December 2018. The jury, believing her account of assault, found in her favour; returning a verdict yesterday evening after six hours of deliberations. McGregor has been ordered to pay Ms. Hand almost €250,000 in damages. But why has the UFC fighter not been found guilty of rape? How has Ms. Hand successfully sued him in the High Court? And what did the jury hear to persuade them she was the one telling the truth. Frank Greaney is courts correspondent for the Bauer Media group, which owns radio stations including Newstalk and TodayFM. He explains how Nikita Hand faced down McGregor at great personal cost. Please be advised this episode contains details of sexual assault, which some listeners may find distressing.Produced and presented by Aideen Finnegan. Johnson is now a superstar. Any hopes of McGregor to follow him or Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder-turned movie star-turned politician, must be measured against the jury’s verdict. Despite the boycott, Road House remains on Amazon Prime’s streaming service. The company had nothing to say about McGregor. “We’re not offering any comment,” Amazon Prime said. McGregor’s Hollywood agent, Audie Attar, did not reply to questions. Similarly, his London-based spokeswoman did not respond to queries. These included the question of whether McGregor was contractually bound to repay fees in the event of adverse court findings. “Those are pretty common in contracts now if this [behaviour] is over a line that the brands wanted,” Prof O’Reilly said. The business meltdown started on Monday when IO Interactive, Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, cut ties with the fighter. “In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” the company said. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr McGregor from our storefronts starting today.” IO Interactive did not respond to further questions. Yet it is clear the company had high hopes for a Hitman game with a “mysterious Disruptor featuring global superstar Conor McGregor”. At the time IO Interactive said it was “beyond thrilled” to work with the fighter, citing his “raw charisma and energy”. McGregor said he had “a lot of fun creating the character and bringing him to life”. All of that has now ended. The Irish response was less immediate, coming two days after Rape Crisis Network Ireland urged retailers to stop selling McGregor stout and the whiskey brand he sold to Mexican group Proximo Spirits in 2021. But the dam broke just before lunchtime on Tuesday when Barry Group, owner of Costcutter stores and Carry Out off-licences, became the first to drop Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey, saying: “This action reflects our commitment to maintaining a retail environment that resonates with the values of our customers and partners.” [ More than 1,000 shops including Tesco, SuperValu and Centra stores remove brands linked to Conor McGregorOpens in new window ] Musgrave, owner of the Supervalu and Centra chains, quickly followed. So too did wholesaler BWG, saying it will no longer distribute McGregor-linked brands to Spar, Eurospar, Mace, Londis and XL stores. BWG’s decision removed product from 1,000 outlets. Bigger still was Tesco’s move to delist McGregor brands from more than 4,200 Irish and UK stores and its online shop. Then came the response of Proximo, the Mexican owner of Bushmills Irish whiskey and Tequila which made a big bet on Proper No. Twelve in 2021: “Going forward, we do not plan to use Mr McGregor’s name and likeness in the marketing of the brand.” The properwhiskey.com website was soon offline. The bad news kept coming. Retailer Asda dropped Forged Stout from 500 UK stores on Thursday. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon cut the product from seven Irish pubs. Off-licence chain O’Brien’s cut both stout and whiskey, as did State airport group DAA. Manchester-based LWC, the UK’s largest independent drinks wholesaler, also cut ties with McGregor, saying it had taken the “necessary legal steps” to end distribution of his stout. [ From the very start Conor McGregor was telling us and showing us who he wasOpens in new window ] “We are consulting with our customers to support them in the replacement of Forged draught taps. LWC does not want to be associated with Conor McGregor or Forged Irish Stout.” The irony is that McGregor’s “notorious” image once gave business something akin to a golden ticket into the world of young men. Research in 2016 by a sports consultancy then known PSG Sponsorship showed he was the athlete most admired by almost one-in-three Irish people aged 18-34. He was less popular with older people. But the nationwide poll of 1,000 people reflected McGregor’s meteoric rise, placing him ahead of boxer Katie Taylor, rowers Gary and Paul O’Donovan, jockey Ruby Walsh, rugby star Johnny Sexton and soccer player Robbie Keane. He was sixth most popular only two years earlier. Although this carried immense business appeal, the accounts of McGregor’s main Dublin company give little insight into his overall fortune. Abridged financial statements filed on Monday for McGregor Sports and Entertainment Ltd show profits fell in 2023 to €194,297 from €528,263 the previous year, with accumulated profits at €506,475. No longer is the image positive, it’s negative ... now the brand senses a problem McGregor’s returns from the $130 million Proximo deal and the $100 million he reportedly received for a Las Vegas boxing defeat in 2017 to Floyd Mayweather seem to be elsewhere. The money came on top of the tens of millions of dollars he earned from his UFC fight career. Business magazine Forbes listed him as the world’s highest-paid athlete in 2021, behind football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with salary/winnings of $22 million and endorsements of $158 million. For as long as it lasted, business was fully behind McGregor’s macho personality. “Only a very, very few athletes have properties that reach the kind of markets he does,” said Prof O’Reilly. “He’s kind of on the edge but he’s never really gone over the edge.” That changed with the High Court verdict, no matter that these were civil and not criminal proceedings. “So, no longer is the image positive, it’s negative. So now the brand senses a problem,” said Prof O’Reilly. Right now, McGregor is short on supporters. But one man who has leapt to his defence is Roger Stone, acolyte of incoming US president Donald Trump and a Republican Party activist going back to the time of Richard Nixon. In a bizarre claim, Stone contended in a message to McGregor on X that the allegations against him stemmed from the fighter “telling the truth about how they are trying to destroy free speech in your country”. “Don’t give up. Keep fighting for the Ireland you love. God bless you,” Stone told him in the social media post. Stone’s intervention was in line with dismissive response of the Make America Great Again movement to court findings against Trump. Still, this was a world away from the mass-market allure that McGregor cultivated. Only weeks have passed since a Netflix boxing match yielded a $20 million pay-day for Mike Tyson, who served a prison term for rape in 1990s. Asked whether this showed McGregor could find a way back, Prof O’Reilly said Tyson’s appeal was at the box office, not in sponsorship. Mixed martial arts sponsors may stay with McGregor but “they’re very small”, he said. The bigger potential loss was from sponsors not directly linked to fighting. Citing Tiger Woods’ loss of non-golf sponsors after the exposure of his marital infidelity, Prof O’Reilly said: “It’s literally cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.” McGregor will appeal the court findings but the strain on his business interests could hardly be greater. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Veterans Harmed by Biden Policies Propose List of Nominees for Incoming Trump Administration

Time Published: 2024-11-28T21:04:33Z
Full Content:
A community of military veterans who fought against initiatives from the Biden administration they deemed unconstitutional have put together a list of 18 names they would like to see appointed to positions in the incoming Trump administration to help President-elect Donald Trump implement reform in the Pentagon or other agencies. Representatives of the community, which consists of 80,000 disaffected veterans whose military careers were ended or damaged after they challenged the Biden administration’s policies, said the list was peer-nominated. “These men and women come from field grade and general officer ranks, have staff experience within the DoD headquarters establishment, and have led exemplary careers within the military, government, and private sector. They have each proven themselves as dedicated public servants, standing fast to their duty to defend the Constitution at great peril to their personal interests,” they said in a statement accompanying the names. “These names do not belong to a special interest group or have vested personal interest, they are merely willing to serve their country again as trusted stewards of the American People,” they added. The names are: “Every American should pay attention to this list, as it represents real leaders who care about the country and constitution over self-interest and institutions,” Air Force veteran and spokeswoman for the group, Kacy Dixon, said. The group putting forward the names first came together as they fought against the Biden Pentagon’s COVID vaccine mandate, which led to the involuntarily discharge of more than 8,000 troops and thousands more who chose to leave. Earlier this year, they drafted the Declaration of Military Accountability, which calls for holding senior military leaders accountable. They have also expanded their call for accountability to the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, government waste, and the DEI agenda. Representative of the group Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Carolyn Rocco said in a statement, “These 18 are the vanguard of over 200 grassroots nominations that are proven courageous public servants ready to restore the military. Each nominee carries unique professional qualifications and has demonstrated their dedication to duty.” Air Force veteran Jordan Karr added, “The rank and file intend to recommend a powerful support team for the future SECDEF; a team that he can count on to restore purpose, unity, and trust to our armed forces.” The group said an additional list of hundreds more names is available upon request.

Title: Graphology
URL: https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Graphology
Time Published: 2024-11-28T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Graphology (or graphoanalysis, but not graphanalysis) is the analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting purporting to be able to identify the writer, indicating psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluating personality characteristics.[1] It is generally considered a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6] The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination due to the fact that aspects of the latter dealing with the examination of handwritten documents are occasionally referred to as the frequently confused term graphanalysis. Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.[7][8] The word Graphology is derived from grapho- (from the Greek γραφή, "writing") and logos (from the Greek λόγος, which relates to discussion or theory).[9] Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated in 1991 that Juan Huarte de San Juan's 1575 Examen de ingenios para las ciencias was the first book on handwriting analysis.[10][11] In American graphology, Camillo Baldi's Trattato come da una lettera missiva si conoscano la natura e qualita dello scrittore from 1622 is considered to be the first book.[12][13] Around 1830 Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings[14][15] shortly after founding Société Graphologique in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Crépieux-Jamin who rapidly published a series of books[16][17] that were soon published in other languages.[18][19] Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Crépieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology. Alfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it "the science of the future" despite rejection of his results by graphologists. After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his finding in Zeitschrift für Menschenkunde (Journal for the Study of Mankind). His major contribution to the field can be found in Handschrift und Charakter.[20][21] Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942.[22] In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching Graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.[23] Regarding a proposed correlation between gender and handwriting style, a paper by published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.[24] Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance,[2][25][26] and today it is considered to be a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6][27] Graphology is primarily used as a recruiting tool to screen candidates during the evaluation process. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.[2][25] In a 1987 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire using writing samples from the same people.[8] In a 1988 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Myers-Briggs test using writing samples from the same people.[28] A 1982 meta-analysis drawn from over 200 studies concludes that graphologists were generally unable to predict any kind of personality trait on any personality test.[29] Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study.[30] A broad literature screen done by King and Koehler confirmed dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless predictors of job performance.[25] Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: "[i]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting", adding that the practice is "useless... absolutely hopeless".[31] The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both "zero validity".[31] Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by the skeptic James Randi in 1991.[32] In his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled "All About Graphology," scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports:[6] In his book The Write Stuff, Dr. Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Dr. Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies: Dean showed that graphologists have failed unequivocally to demonstrate the validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on an unsuspecting public. Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other... In fact, no graphologist of any stripe was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy. Dunning concludes:[6] Other divining techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole "handwriting is brainwriting" idea — traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test. Max Pulver supports a system called symbolic analysis in which he looks for symbols in the handwriting.[38][39][40][41] Each approach to handwriting analysis has spawned several systems. Integrative graphology focuses on strokes and their relation to personality.[42] Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States, between 1929 and 2000. The Sistema de Xandró is another method of integrative graphology.[43][44][45] Holistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space.[42] The psychogram[12][46][47] is another method which uses specific diagrams to analyze handwriting. The Personal Worth Chart is one such method developed by the Handwriting Consultants of San Diego[48] during the early 1980s. The psychograph is an additional psychogram method.[49] was developed by Leslie King during the 1970s .The Wittlich Character Diagram,[50][51] and the Muller-Enskat Protokol[52][53] are other psychogram methods. Psychologists Leopold Szondi, Augusto Vels, and Girolamo Moretti invented their personal schools of graphology.[54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65] Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis: The majority of material in the field is oriented toward the Latin writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias. Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means to feel or exhibit annoyance. In Graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.[68][69] A report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.[70] There have been a number of studies on gender and handwriting.[71][72][73][74] Uniformly the research indicates that gender can be determined at a significant level. The published studies on ethnicity,[75][76][77] race,[78][79][80] age,[81][82][83] nationality,[84] gender orientation, weight, and their relationship to handwriting have had mixed results. One of the rules of thumb in human resources is that if an individual who has an ADA-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests that cannot be adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company. Handwriting clearly falls into the group of tests that cannot be adapted to be administered to individuals who fall within one or more ADA-defined disabilities. Blind people, for example, do not develop the required fluency in handwriting, for the writing to be correctly analyzed. Questions that handwriting analysts ask before doing an analysis can be illegal under this act.[85] A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and proceeds to do a personality profile, matching the congruency of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position.[86] A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools. Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure[87] to guarded success.[88] The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.[89] The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds[90] and on legal grounds in the United States.[91] Graphology has been used clinically by European counselors and psychotherapists.[50][51][52][53] When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.[92] In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship.[93] The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring.[94] Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis.[95] Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, pressure, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents.[96] The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body. The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice. This is the practice of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality. It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s.[97][98] The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises which are similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.

More Info The FBI has been investigating a longtime Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) consultant over the contractor's alleged role in a hack-and-leak operation that targeted emails by environmentalists critical of Exxon Mobil’s role in climate change, Reuters has reported exclusively. The multi-year operation involved hackers who breached email accounts of environmental activists and others. The scheme allegedly began in late 2015, when U.S. authorities contended that the names of the hacking targets were compiled by the DCI Group, a public affairs and lobbying company working for Exxon at the time. For years, Exxon Mobil has been a target for climate activists. Two years ago, the company lost three board seats to Engine No. 1, an activist hedge, in a stunning proxy campaign. Engine No. 1 demanded that Exxon needs to cut fossil fuel production for the company to position itself for long-term success. "What we're saying is, plan for a world where maybe the world doesn't need your barrels," Engine No.1 leader Charlie Penner told the Financial Times. Engine No. 1 enjoyed a stunning victory thanks to support from BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street who all voted against Exxon’s leadership. However, the backlash against Big Oil has faded in recent years even as the countries everywhere rush to beef up their energy security. In 2022, Exxon recorded a major victory after its shareholders supported the company's energy transition strategy at the annual general meeting. Only 28% of the participants backed a resolution filed by the Follow This activist group urging faster action to battle climate change; a proposal calling for a report on low carbon business planning received just 10.5% support while a report on plastic production garnered a 37% favorable vote. Following in the footsteps of its larger peer, Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX) shareholders likewise voted against a resolution asking the company to adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, indicating support for the steps the company already has taken to address climate change. Just 33% of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, according to preliminary figures disclosed by the company, a sharp turnaround from last year when 61% of shareholders voted to support a similar proposal.

Title: TuSimple co-founder demands liquidation, sues company for control of his shares | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Xiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving truck startup TuSimple, is demanding that the board immediately liquidate the company and return all remaining funds — roughly $450 million — to shareholders “on a pure pro-rata basis, regardless of share class,” according to a letter that TechCrunch has viewed. Hou is also suing TuSimple and his former co-founder Mo Chen, the company’s chief producer and director, to confirm that a 2022 voting agreement granting Chen control over TuSimple expired in November 2024, which Hou says would revert his voting rights back to him. Hou has even created a website, SaveTuSimple.com, to raise awareness about his campaign to liquidate TuSimple and return cash to shareholders — which include Traton Group, BlackRock, and Vanguard. The site states that as of November 26, TuSimple’s stock trades at $0.24 per share, while holding $1.93 per share in cash alone. It advertises that through liquidation, TuSimple shareholders “can immediately realize this 700%+ premium to current market price.” The letter, lawsuit, and campaign are the latest flare-ups in an ongoing fight between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, which include Hou, over the company’s attempts to send its remaining assets to China. Before shuttering its U.S. operations and delisting from the stock market earlier this year, TuSimple was a pre-revenue company, so any cash it has today would have come from investors. Hou and other shareholders have accused TuSimple’s leaders of diverting assets toward animation and gaming businesses linked to Chen, framing it as a business pivot. After shareholders raised concerns of self-dealing in an August letter to the board, TuSimple surprised many by unveiling a new AI-generated animation and gaming unit. Earlier this month, Hou urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order on TuSimple to stop the company from transferring U.S. assets to China as part of an existing shareholder lawsuit. Hou said he was galvanized to action after noticing filings that he says signaled TuSimple was preparing to transfer large sums of money to China. TuSimple has fought back against Hou, bringing up its own litigation alleging trade secrets theft after Hou launched his autonomous trucking startup, Bot Auto, in Texas last month. “As a founder who invested seven years building TuSimple Holdings Inc. and its largest shareholder, it has been disappointing to watch shareholders’ collective investment value plummet by over 91% in less than two years under the leadership of Mo Chen … and Chairman and CEO Cheng Lu,” Hou wrote in the letter, which he sent to the board on Monday. Hou filed suit against TuSimple and Chen last week in the Delaware Chancery Court, which is known to be friendly to shareholder rights. In the filing, he also asked the court to postpone TuSimple’s upcoming annual shareholder meeting, which is currently scheduled for December 20, to “prevent the implementation of proposed significant governance changes before the voting rights dispute is resolved.” Sources familiar with the matter say Hou wants time to solicit proxies to get more investors on his side. Aside from Hou and Chen, TuSimple’s largest shareholder, with an 11.8% stake, is Sun Dream, an affiliate of Chinese conglomerate Sina Corporation, an investment that brought scrutiny from federal regulators. The remaining large shareholders are Logistics giant Traton (7.6% stake); Vanguard Group (6.1% stake); BlackRock (5.6% stake); and Camac Partners (5.5% stake). Camac has also written to urge the board to keep TuSimple’s funds in the U.S. The other three investors did not respond in time to TechCrunch to comment. But before Hou can convince shareholders to back him, he’ll need to get control over his own shares, which are the subject of his lawsuit. In the fall of 2022, a probe from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States led TuSimple to reveal that its employees spent paid hours in 2021 working for Hydron — Chen’s hydrogen trucking startup based in China — and shared confidential information with the company. As a result, Hou was ousted from his posts as CEO, president, and CTO, and from his position as chairman of the board, though he retained a seat on the board. Hou has maintained that the firing was done without just cause. He and Chen were concerned that the board was engaged in a power grab that wasn’t in TuSimple’s best interest, so they discussed combining their voting powers to reinstate Chen on the board and bring Hou back as CTO after an internal investigation about the Hydron allegations. (Hou never got his CTO post back.) On November 9, Hou signed an agreement with Chen that would give the latter “irrevocable proxy and power of attorney” over Hou’s shares in TuSimple: Around 13.4 million shares of Class A common stock, and 12 million shares of Class B common stock. Put together, Hou’s shares would account for 29.7% of TuSimple’s total voting power. The agreement, which TechCrunch has viewed, expired after two years. Hou says this means the shares should revert back to him. But Chen has other ideas. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated November 9, 2024, Chen reaffirmed his claim to Hou’s shares, stating that he controls 57.9% of the company’s voting power. The filing also states that while the irrevocable proxy indeed terminated, “the voting agreement, and the voting arrangement thereunder, remain in full force and effect.” In other words, while Hou may be in possession of the shares, he still needs to vote as Chen directs. (It’s worth noting that since voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January, TuSimple has failed to file quarterly updates, which are required for a company that is still registered with the SEC. TuSimple is also attempting to deregister from the SEC.) TuSimple included similar language around the deal with Hou in its proxy statement to shareholders ahead of the upcoming annual meeting, during which they will vote on renewing the six current directors and whether to create a classified board, or a staggered board. Half of the board’s current makeup is TuSimple executives: Chen; TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu; and TuSimple COO Jianan Hao. The other three — James Lu, Zhen Tao, and Albert Schultz — are meant to be independent directors. If the second proposal were to pass, it would prevent shareholders from replacing the entire board in a single vote and it could entrench control with Chen, who would effectively be ensuring his preferred directors stay in place for the long term. A hearing to expedite the review of Hou’s complaint and to decide on his request to postpone TuSimple’s annual meeting is scheduled for December 2. TuSimple did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Title: While private equity firms own 40% of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 49% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significant control over SATS by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders 11% of SATS is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private equity firms make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of SATS, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for SATS Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that SATS does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of SATS, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in SATS. Our data shows that Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is the largest shareholder with 40% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 2.2%. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that SATS Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around S$19m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private equity firms hold a 40% stake in SATS. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SATS better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for SATS that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.
