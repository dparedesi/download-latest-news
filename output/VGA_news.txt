Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Lyme disease (LD) remains the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere, with over 100,000 cases reported annually in Europe, and ~476,000 in the United States [1,2]. Although LD can be treated with antibiotics, if detected early, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for humans to prevent infection. One of the key challenges in developing an effective vaccine against LD stems from the complex biology of Borrelia outer surface proteins (Osps), whose expression is dynamically regulated in response to distinct environmental cues, in both the arthropod vector and vertebrate host (Fig 1). Among the predominant outer surface proteins, OspC expression is induced in ticks during Borrelia transmission, and is sustained during early mammalian host infection, while the expression of OspA is restricted only to the tick phase [3] and is no longer expressed in Borrelia once the infection is established in the mammalian host [4]. As a result, infected humans only rarely develop anti-OspA antibodies [5]. Yet, OspA has proven to be a highly effective vaccine antigen, as it induces antibodies that bind to Borrelia within attached ticks, preventing their transmission [6]. As a new human LD vaccine candidate targeting OspA (VLA15, see below) enters Phase 3 trials, a central challenge is not only achieving protection but also sustaining it, given that its effectiveness strongly depends on maintaining high antibody titres. Serology monitoring tools may thus become an integral component of the vaccination programme, not only to distinguish between infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, but also to track protective antibody titres over time, thereby ensuring sustained vaccine-induced immunity. During tick feeding, Borrelia alters the expression of its outer surface proteins [4] in response to environmental cues. OspA (yellow) is highly expressed in the midgut of unfed ticks, where it is thought to mediate adherence to the midgut epithelium. As the tick begins feeding, OspA is downregulated, while OspC (orange) is upregulated to facilitate early mammalian invasion. During systemic infection in the vertebrate host, CspZ (blue) becomes expressed and promotes complement evasion through Factor H binding.

The vaccine OspA antigen sequence was derived from North American B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, offering limited coverage of the diverse Borrelia genospecies that cause LD in Europe (e.g., B. afzelii, B. garinii). The vaccine was later withdrawn from the market in 2002 due to public concerns and limited uptake, despite clinical validation of its safety and effectiveness [7]. These concerns arose mainly due to a potential autoimmune reaction: a segment of B. burgdorferi OspA shares sequence homology with human leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (hLFA-1) within the OspA C-terminus, raising a molecular mimicry hypothesis for treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis in people carrying the HLA-DR4 antigen [8]. The second-generation LD vaccine candidate (VLA15) directly addresses both issues: it provides a broad genospecies coverage and eliminates concerns about autoimmunity. VLA15, co-developed by Valneva and Pfizer, is a multivalent subunit vaccine candidate designed to provide broad protection against LD by targeting six OspA serotypes (serotypes 1–6). These serotypes represent the major Borrelia genospecies, causing human infection across North America and Europe [9]. To achieve broad serotype coverage, VLA15 incorporates three recombinant fusion proteins, each composed of the C-terminal OspA domains from two serotypes: serotypes 1 and 2, serotypes 3 and 4, and serotypes 5 and 6 (Fig 2). The domains within each fusion protein are connected by a 21-amino acid linker derived from two segments of the N-terminal region of OspA serotype 1 (Fig 2). Additionally, the OspA antigens in VLA15 have been optimised by introducing a single disulfide bond into every subunit to enhance structural stability. OspA proteins are natively lipidated at an N-terminal cysteine, tethering them to the plasma membrane of the spirochete [10]. In vaccine formulations, retaining this lipidation markedly enhanced immunogenicity and protective efficacy [11]. To enable this lipidation at the N-terminus of the mutant OspA C-terminal fragment heterodimers, a lipidation signal sequence derived from the Escherichia coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) was introduced at their N-terminus and immediately followed C-terminally by a CSS peptide (patent publication number: WO2014006226A1). This provides the N-terminal cysteine for lipidation after signal peptide cleavage. Lastly, the hLFA-1-like fragment in OspA serotype 1 was replaced by the corresponding region from OspA serotype 2 (summarised in [12]). These designs create recombinant fusion proteins that are structurally distinct from native OspA yet retain immunological characteristics critical for vaccine effectiveness. The map (top panel) highlights the geographic distribution of the predominant Borrelia species associated with human Lyme disease across regions: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in North America, and B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in Europe and Asia. These species correspond to six predominant OspA serotypes (1–6), which underpin the multivalent OspA vaccine design and enable broad coverage across the dominant, geographically diverse Borrelia genospecies. The distribution map is based on the CDC’s Lyme Disease Case Map (June 2025) and LD surveillance data from Canada [32], overlayed on a base map sourced from naturalearthdata.com. The schematic (bottom panel) illustrates the VLA15 vaccine composition, which includes OspA C-terminal domains from serotypes 1–6 connected, via a 21-amino acid linker, which is derived by merging two loop regions of the N-terminal domain from serotype 1 (residues 65-GTSDKNNGSG-74 and 43-SKEKNKDGKYS-53, in which residue D53 has been mutated to S). Each subunit contains an introduced disulfide bond to increase stability. To avoid hLFA-1 mimicry, the serotype 1 hLFA-1-like epitope was replaced with the corresponding serotype 2 sequence.

Vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies from the human host would then be drained by attached ticks, as part of their blood meal, would bind its cognate antigen, neutralising Borrelia during tick feeding, and ultimately block transmission of Borrelia to humans [13]. This comes with a principal limitation of lacking an anamnestic response, leaving host immunity almost entirely dependent on sustained antibody titres rather than memory responses. The fact is also that OspA is not essential during mammalian infection [14]. In order for the vaccine to be effective, it must thus act with near-perfect efficiency at high-titre levels to sustain its capacity to neutralise spirochetes during tick feeding. If spirochetes escape neutralisation in the tick and enter the vertebrate host, OspA is downregulated and is no longer displayed on the Borrelia surface, leaving vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies without a target and making protection unlikely at that stage. This property also precludes the vaccine’s use for post-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention. Based on the LYMErix Phase 3 trial, the CDC concluded that an anti-OspA (LA-2 antigen) antibody titre greater than 1,200 ELISA units/mL was correlated with 1-year protection against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the United States [15]. The breakthrough infections that occurred were mainly associated with individuals with lower titres, identifying antibody concentration as the principal correlate of vaccine efficacy. For the multivalent VLA15 vaccine (VALOR Phase 3, NCT05477524), which targets six OspA C-terminal domains, protective thresholds have not yet been defined. Because VLA15 covers multiple Borrelia species rather than a single U.S. strain covered by LYMErix, protective levels may need to be determined for each OspA serotype or at least for the dominant one. Notably, anti-OspA antibody levels after VLA15 vaccination decline substantially within months, particularly in elderly individuals, who often generate lower and shorter-lived titres [16,17]. In Europe, where Borrelia isolates causing breakthrough infections are rarely genotyped, such thresholds will require further refinement. Establishing serotype-specific minimal protective titres could improve serology-guided booster scheduling and support data-driven vaccine optimisation. The fact that VLA15 includes only the C-termini of OspA proteins, and that anti-OspA-antibodies are rare in sera as a response to LD infection [18], allows tracking levels of vaccine-induced antibodies. Even though the whole OspA protein is immunogenic and can, in rare cases, be exposed during infection to host immunity, hallmarking, e.g., prolonged arthritis [19], the presence of anti-OspA IgG antibodies in sera will be mostly indicative of vaccine-induced antibodies in vaccinated individuals. We recommend revising current diagnostic antigen sets, which typically contain full-length OspA (frequently derived from multiple Borrelia strains in Europe), to instead include distinct N- and C-terminal fragments of OspA (Fig 3). Such antigenic microchip, for example, would contain: (1) established antigens to flag past or present LD [20], (2) the N-terminus of OspA to detect the rare anti-OspA responses observed in prolonged episodes of LD (thereby identifying individuals for whom OspA-based vaccination should not be recommended), and (3) the C-terminus of OspA that would monitor the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies for people with negative N-terminus OspA immunodetection (Fig 3). For quantitative readouts, titration of OspA C-termini would allow tracking of post-vaccination levels of antibodies (Fig 3). Once validated correlates of protection are established, this approach could guide seasonal vaccine strategies and ensure protection during peak tick activity. A) During mammalian infection, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) expresses surface proteins that elicit a specific humoral immune response. Commonly targeted antigens include VlsE, OspC, and flagellin (p41), whereas antibodies against OspA are rarely detected (≤15% of cases). B) The VLA15 vaccine is composed only of the C-termini of OspA of 6 B. burgdorferi s.l. serotypes. C) The current standard two-tier testing for LD typically combines an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a mixture of selected antigens or a single-antigen (e.g., VlsE) with a confirmatory strip-blot assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against multiple Borrelia antigens. D) These strip blots often contain full-length OspA antigens, which will also detect antibodies in vaccinated individuals following VLA15 implementation. E) Diagnostic immunostrips can be multiplexed using microchip-based technologies, which can provide more targeted and detailed information by distinguishing infection-induced from vaccine-induced antibody responses. Provided a vaccinated person is sero-negative (grey) for acute (e.g., VlsE) or prolonged LD (N-terminal OspA) infection, such individual will be possibly eligible for VLA15 vaccination. These technologies can also enable quantitative, time-resolved tracking of vaccine-induced antibody levels (C-terminal OspA, yellow). Signal intensity will either indicate the anticipated protective level or significant waning of vaccine induced antibody titres, indicating a call for a vaccine booster. Inclusion of acute infection antigens (e.g., VlsE) in these multiplex immunoassays will also allow to detect breakthrough infections. The correlation between circulating antibody levels and the occurrence of LD infections will help define the precise threshold of protective immunity.

The mRNA vaccines mRNA-1975 and mRNA-1982 developed by ModernaTX, Inc. (ClinicalTrials.gov: ID NCT05975099), code for full-length proteins (WO2024215721A1) that will prevent any potential opportunity for differentiation of vaccine-induced and rare infection-induced anti-OspA IgG antibodies in the sera. It is important to realise that with the introduction of the OspA-based VLA15 vaccine, modified two-tier testing (MTTT) currently using whole cell lysate [21] will also become susceptible to vaccine-induced seroreactivity in uninfected patients. Therefore, platforms with informative single-antigens [22] or single-epitopes [23,24] may offer a more practical tool, with detailed precision, for the diagnosis of infections and determination of vaccine titres. Many Borrelia infections in endemic regions remain subclinical and untreated, resulting in seropositive individuals without a documented history of LD. While there is currently no publicly available efficacy or safety data for VLA15 in individuals with a history of LD, it is reasonable to expect that future studies or post-licensure monitoring will address this gap. To minimise safety risks and ensure that immunogenicity data reflect naïve populations, phase 1 [16,25–27], phase 2 [16,26,27], and the ongoing phase 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05477524) clinical trials of the VLA15 vaccine have excluded participants with detectable anti-Borrelia antibodies, as well as individuals with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory arthritis. Although no vaccine-associated adverse effects have been reported in seronegative individuals enrolled in these trials, theoretical concerns remain regarding possible inflammatory responses in previously Lyme-exposed individuals. This is likely due to potential immune recognition of residual OspA antigen in immune-privileged sites, such as synovial tissue. Therefore, more data need to be collected on the vaccination of people with a history of LD, or pre-vaccination immune-screening, using conventional or emerging serological tools in future clinical practice to identify individuals with prior exposure. The inclusion of Borrelia antigens expressed during early human infection offers a promising avenue for the design of multi-antigen LD vaccines. Such strategies could synergistically combine OspA-based transmission-blocking components with antigens targeting transmitted Borrelia that breached anti-OspA protection. OspC emerges as a promising candidate due to its crucial role during the initial phase of mammalian infection [28]. OspC is markedly upregulated upon spirochete transmission to the vertebrate host, facilitating successful colonisation and eliciting a robust antibody response. However, its utility in vaccine development is complicated by significant antigenic variability, with numerous OspC serotypes circulating in endemic Borrelia populations. To address this diversity, “chimeritope” vaccines have already been successfully developed for canines. These fusion proteins incorporate immunogenic epitopes from multiple OspC variants into a single, mosaic antigen. The canine Lyme vaccine, VANGUARDcrLyme (Zoetis), exemplifies this approach by including a chimeric OspC antigen (Ch14), derived from segments of 14 distinct OspC types, alongside OspA. This strategy induces antibodies with broad reactivity, providing extensive protection [29]. Murine models have confirmed that OspC chimeritopes similarly generate cross-protective antibody responses, emphasising their potential translational relevance to human vaccines [29]. Critically, incorporating OspC, or other antigens expressed early during host infection into OspA-based vaccines, may enable a rapid anamnestic response to these antigens upon spirochete entry into the host. Another promising vaccine candidate is the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 (also known as CRASP-2 or CspZ). Although CspZ is known to bind the complement regulator factor H (FH), it thus blocks activation of complement on the surface of the spirochete. CspZ-YA, a double mutant (two-point mutations) of CspZ from B. burgdorferi, has been engineered to lack its native FH-binding activity, thereby exposing epitopes that are otherwise shielded by FH. By further introducing protein-stabilising mutations into CspZ-YA, namely I183Y or C187S, a robust bactericidal antibody response is observed, which protects against infection in mouse models [30]. These results suggest that either CspZ-YAC187S or CspZ-YAI183Y would be promising components for inclusion into future multivalent LD vaccines. It should be noted that while these antigens (e.g., OspC, CspZ) show strong potential in preclinical studies, to date, no multi-antigen vaccines have entered human clinical trials; all clinical-stage candidates remain OspA-based. Lyme disease prevention is entering a transformative phase. The VLA15 vaccine represents the most advanced candidate to date, overcoming historical limitations by broadening genospecies coverage and resolving safety concerns. Yet, the effectiveness of OspA-based vaccines depends fundamentally on maintaining high antibody titres at the time of tick exposure. Emerging miniaturised high-throughput serological microarray platforms, designed to differentiate infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, could not only enable robust multi-epitope LD diagnosis but also incorporate epitopes for monitoring vaccine-induced titres. Such data-based booster scheduling may help sustain protective immunity through each tick season [31], preventing breakthrough infections. However, defining human correlates of protection remains a key unmet need. With most technical limitations in vaccine design now resolved, the integration of data-guided, personalised serology may enhance the likelihood of success for the second generation of vaccine strategies capable of preventing Lyme disease in humans.

Sternal surgical site infections after cardiac surgery can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The effects of negative pressure wound management and adding vancomycin as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis are unknown. The PICS-PREVENA pilot/vanguard trial, a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial with 4 periods, was conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Sites were randomized to one of eight sequences of the four study arms (Cefazolin or Cefazolin + Vancomycin (not analyzed) and standard wound dressing or a negative pressure 3M Prevena incision management system (Prevena). Only diabetic or obese patients were eligible for the latter comparison. This trial investigated feasability including adherence to protocol of each intervention (goal: > 90% each) and loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%). Among the 4107 included patients, 2230 were obese/diabetic (1208 standard wound dressing period, 1022 during Prevena period). Compliance to wound management and antimicrobial prophylaxis was 68.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Loss to follow-up was 3.6%. Deep/organ-space sternal surgical site infections occurred in 16 (1.6%) patients in the Prevena allocated periods and in 17 (1.4%) patients in the standard wound dressing allocated periods (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.56–2.20). Other clinical outcomes did not suggest a difference and a post-hoc as-treated analysis showed similar results. This study showed challenges with introducing a novel technology as standard of care, with non-compliance mostly driven by one of the sites. No firm conclusions should be drawn regarding the effectiveness of Prevena, as this vanguard trial was not powered for clinical outcomes.

The prevalence of surgical site infections (SSI), one of the most common infections, varies between 0.6–9.5%, depending on the surgical procedure [1]. The occurrence of SSIs is associated with long-term harm, increased mortality, and cost [2–4]. In cardiac surgery, SSIs include local infections at the thoracic and sternal wounds (s-SSI) and infections at vein harvesting sites, which both are reported in about 2% of patients [5,6]. Obese patients or patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for s-SSI after cardiac surgery [6–8]. The multiple interventions, which are recommended to prevent SSIs, can be divided into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions [9]. The use of incisional negative pressure wound dressing therapy, a postoperative measure, was found to be associated with a probable decrease in SSI compared to standard dressing in a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials [10]. However, data regarding cardiac surgery, either for the sternal or vein harvest surgical site, is limited and the low quality of existing studies highlights the need for large, randomised trials [10,11]. The combination of cluster randomization, factorial- and crossover-designs can make large trials more feasible and efficient, provide data in real-world settings, investigate multiple interventions, and control cluster level confounding variables by having each cluster act as its own control [12–14]. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery (PICS)-PREVENA Pilot/Vanguard study is a multicenter cluster-randomized 2x2 factorial crossover trial investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis (cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis vs cefazolin prophylaxis) and the impact of the negative pressure wound treatment (negative pressure Prevena dressing vs standard wound dressing) on the occurrence of SSIs in patients having cardiac surgery. Here we report the feasibility outcomes of adherence to protocol and loss to follow-up as well as the clinical endpoints comparing Prevena to standard wound dressing (S1 Appendix). Reporting of this trial followed the CONSORT checklist – extension for pilot and feasibility trials [15]. (S2 Appendix). PICS-Prevena is a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03402945) conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Hospitals performing more than 300 cardiac surgeries a year were eligible. Clinical Trial Ontario (CTO) approved the study and waived the need for individual patient consent. The study design was adapted from the Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery study, which is still underway [13] (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02285140). The trial was funded by KCI Inc. USA. The industry sponsor had no role in conducting the trial other than supporting education on their product at the study site. The industry sponsor did provide input on the study design, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The industry sponsor had no role in data collection, analysis and had no access to the raw data. The industry sponsor had the right to review and provide feedback on the manuscript before submission, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The target sample size for the pilot/vanguard phase was 4,000 patients, with roughly 500 patients per each of the four treatment allocations within a 2x2 factorial design at each of the two participating sites resulting in 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the feasibility outcomes within a small margin of less than ± 1%. Such narrow confidence intervals for feasibility outcomes would not necessarily be needed. However, given that randomization was conducted at the cluster level, we needed to enroll at least two sites to gain the necessary insight into potential challenges with the feasibility of the study design for a potential full trial. All patients ≥18 years undergoing open-heart surgery with sternotomy, including minimally invasive sternotomies, during the study period were included. Patients were excluded if they were on systemic antibiotics or if they had an active bacterial infection at the time of surgery, were previously enrolled in this trial, were known to be colonized with MRSA, had a beta-lactam or vancomycin allergy precluding the use of cefazolin or vancomycin, or were participating in other studies that may interfere with this trial. Furthermore, patients with sensitivity to silver received a standard wound dressing in all study arms as Prevena is contraindicated in these patients. The hospitals were randomly assigned using computer-based randomization to one of eight potential sequences of the four treatment allocations. These four were: i) cefazolin prophylaxis plus Prevena, ii) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus Prevena, iii) cefazolin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing, and iv) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing (S1 Fig). The wound management and antibiotic prophylaxis strategy became standard of care for patients undergoing cardiac surgery during a respective study period. Based on the increased risk for s-SSI, the subgroup of patients who were obese (BMI>=30 kg/m2) or diabetic were eligible for Prevena, and as such the comparison of the wound dressing strategy is limited to this population. The hospital was informed about the next treatment allocation four weeks before the implementation. Before a new study arm was introduced, there was a wash-in phase of four weeks for the new antibiotic prophylaxis. For treatment allocations where Prevena was required, the use of Prevena was introduced in the last week of the wash-in period. The wash-in periods should allow for full-implementation of the interventions as new standard of care and participants undergoing surgery during this time will not be included. To guarantee patient safety, surgeons were allowed to deviate from the standard of care as determined by the treatment allocation whenever deemed necessary. Cefazolin was administered at a dose of 2g (3g if body weight >120 kg) within an hour of the surgery, four hours later or at wound closure (whatever came first), followed by two post-operative dose every 8 hours. Vancomycin was given at a dose of roughly 15 mg/kg and repeated once at 12 hours after the first dose. Prevena was applied to sternal sites and, in case of open saphenous vein harvest, the harvest sites of eligible patients at the end of the procedure. The device was used, as recommended by the manufacturer, for 7 days with a continuous negative pressure at −125 mmHg. User manuals were provided to the participants. Standard wound dressing referred to non-negative pressure wound dressing per standard of care at the hospital. Data was collected from health records and captured in an online research platform. To complete the 90-day follow-up after surgery, data was obtained through a phone call if no follow-up visit was scheduled. Surgical site infections were defined according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Healthcare Safety Network definitions [16]. The outcomes to assess feasibility of this trial design were loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%), adherence to the wound management system (goal: > 90%), and antibiotic regimen as per protocol (goal: > 90%). The primary clinical outcome of the Prevena vs. standard wound dressing arm was a composite of deep incisional or organ/space s-SSI within 90-days. Key secondary clinical effectiveness outcomes were all s-SSI, SSI at the leg site (if open venous saphenous harvest), wound dehiscence, pain intensity at day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality and mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days. In addition, serious adverse device effects (SADEs) were collected during Prevena periods. Detailed information is provided in the statistical analysis plan (S3 Appendix). A blinded outcome adjudication committee reviewed all cases with potential signs or symptoms of an infection that could not be clearly attributed to an infectious focus other than the surgical site(s), and all patients with (suspected) s-SSI. We remain blinded to the results of the two antibiotic strategies as another study assessing the antibiotic strategies using a similar study design is underway [13]. The feasibility outcomes of the vanguard study were summarized by treatment groups as proportions. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the time of randomization to one of the study arms were included (intention-to-treat, ITT). The adherence to the antibiotic regimen was assessed by reviewing health records in a minimum of randomly selected 5% of eligible patients. Baseline data are reported by treatment group using count and percentage for categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. Hierarchical modelling (generalized logistic mixed model) was used for the clinical outcomes in the intention-to-treat high-risk patient population with diabetes mellitus or obesity BMI > 30 kg/m2. Comparisons between the groups were reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Due to only two included sites in the vanguard study, the models included centers as random effects to account for the correlation within a center (ICC) and adjusted for the factorial allocation as a fixed effect. As a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the two centers by examining the interaction between treatment and centers. In addition, given the lower-than-expected adherence to Prevena, we conducted a post-hoc as-treated analysis for the primary clinical outcome. The agreement between the outcome adjudication committee and the site diagnosis for deep/organ s-SSI or all s-SSI, respectively, was calculated using Cohens kappa (κ). The agreement within the 3-member adjudication committee was calculated as the proportion of infections with unanimous agreement among adjudicators out of all deep/organ or superficial s-SSI infections, respectively. During the study period from April 3, 2018, to December 13, 2022 (04/2018-10/2020 at site 1, and 04/2018-12/2022 at site 2), 4621 patients underwent surgery at the two study centers. A total of 4107/4621 (88.9%) were eligible (Fig 1). Of these, 2230/4107 (54%) were either obese or had diabetes and were eligible for the comparison of the two wound management strategies. A total of 1022/2230 (46%) underwent their cardiac surgery while Prevena was standard of care, and 1208/2230 (54.2%) during a standard wound dressing period (Fig 1). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.g001 Of those eligible patients, the overall mean ±standard deviation (SD) age was 67.0 ± 10.7 years and 1025/4107 (25%) were female. Mean ±SD BMI was 29.6 ± 6.1 kg/m2. The most common type of surgery was coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 2451/4107, 60%) and surgical valve intervention (n = 645/4107, 16%) followed by combined CABG and valve intervention (n = 466/4107, 11%) and other, non-specified interventions (n = 545/4107, 13%). Open vein harvesting on the leg was performed in 1295/4107 (31%) patients. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t001 The overall loss to follow-up rate at 90 days was 3.7% (153/4107; 95%CI 3.2–4.3%) and 3.6% (81/2230; 95%CI 2.9–4.4%) for the diabetic or obese population. The adherence to the use of Prevena in eligible patients during study periods when Prevena was considered standard of care was 68.1% (696/1022; 95%CI: 65.2–71.0%) overall, 42.8% (217/507; 95%CI: 38.5–47.1%) for Site A, and 93.0% (479/515; 95%CI: 90.8–95.2%) for site B. Baseline characteristics of non-adherent patients are shown in S1 Table. For compliance with the antibiotic regimen, 245 records of all 4107 (6.0%) randomized patients were evaluated. Documented non-adherence to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was rare with 1.2% (95%CI 0.00–2.6%), 0.4% (95%CI 0.00–1.2%), and 0%, respectively. The primary clinical outcome, the composite of deep or organ-space s-SSI, occurred in 33/2107 (1.5%) diabetic or obese patients, whereby 16/1022 infections (1.6%) were recorded in the Prevena and 17/1208 (1.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.56–2.20) (Table 2). When including superficial infections, a total of 80/2107 (3.6%) s-SSIs were documented, 39/1022 (3.8%) in the Prevena and 41/1208 (3.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR:1.12; 95% CI: 0.71–1.75). Among patients who underwent an open venous saphenous harvest during their cardiac surgery, 5/1022 (1.5%) in the Prevena group and 4/1208 (1.1%) in the standard wound dressing period developed an SSI in their leg. The incidence of sternal wound dehiscence was 22/1022 (2.2%) in the Prevena group and 24/1208 (2.0%) in the standard dressing group (OR:1.09; 95% CI: 0.60–1.95). Pain on day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days were also similar in both groups. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t002 There was no evidence of interaction between treatment effect and centers (p = 0.905) in the sensitivity analysis. Similar odds ratios for the primary clinical outcome were obtained when excluding patients who did not receive Prevena due to protocol deviations (i.e., post-hoc per-protocol analysis) (deep/organ-space SSI: Prevena n = 11 (1.6%) vs standard dressing n = 17 (1.4%); OR: 1.17; 95% CI 0.54–2.53). A total of ten serious adverse device effects were reported, none of which was classified as device related (S2 Table). The agreement between the blinded outcome adjudication committee and the site was substantial for deep/organ s-SSI (κ: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56–0.83) and all s-SSI (κ: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55–0.71). Agreement for deep/organ s-SSI within the adjudication committee was 100% (33/33) and 47% (22/47) for superficial infections, whereby in 88% (22/25) of the disagreements one reviewer voted for no infection and in the remaining three cases more information was requested. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery -PREVENA Vanguard study demonstrates the challenges of a 2x2 factorial crossover design investigating the implementation of new infection prevention interventions as standard of care for s-SSI prevention. Despite meeting the targeted feasibility thresholds for loss to follow up (<10%) and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis as per protocol (>90%), the compliance to use the negative pressure wound therapy system Prevena was 68.1%, only, and failed to reach our 90% target. We observed two contrasting patterns in adherence to the two interventions. Documented non-adherence to antibiotic intervention within the trial was low for each of the time periods and at both study sites. However, the adherence to initiate Prevena in 68.1% did not achieve our predefined target of 90%, highlighting the difficulty in introducing a novel intervention to existing, highly regimented workflows, as present in cardiac surgery. Non-adherence to Prevena was mainly driven by missing application of the wound dressing and not early discontinuation. The fact that one of the two sites showed a much better adherence (93.0% vs 42.8%), may be explained by the fact that this site had experience with using negative pressure wound dressing systems before the launch of the trial, whereas this was a new intervention at the other site. Another major complicating factor was that in contrast to the antibiotic regimen, only the subgroup of patients who were diabetic or obese qualified for the application of Prevena during the respective study period, which required a reliable process to identify those who qualify for Prevena pre-operatively. Again, one site was more successful in implementing this pre-identification process than the other site. Including a longer run-in period to expose sites prior to the change of study arm, might have led to increased adherence. Available comparisons of our adherence rates to similar trials in the literature are limited to gain further insights and adopt possible solutions. Recently published reviews that investigated negative pressure wound therapy did not report utilization of cluster RCTs [11,17,18]. Only one of the included individual-level RCTs – a pilot trial – provided adherence data, showing that 2/35 patients allocated to negative pressure wound dressing were switched to control due to the size of the incision [19]. The learning from the experience with this cluster cross-over pilot/vanguard was that subgrouping a population as part of the study design cannot be reliability implemented, that the protocol must be simple with the same intervention being applied to all patients undergoing the procedure during a given study period, and that for a complex intervention such as the use of a novel wound dressing technology longer phase-in periods may be required. Regardless of whether data collection dovetailed on the existing routine surveillance conducted by infection prevention and control professionals at one site or a research team at the other site, the trial demonstrated high follow up rates of >95% at the three-month mark. We used this study design to maximise generalizability in an area of clinical equipoise, to maintain feasibility despite assessing two interventions at the same time, and to reduce the costs of running a large trial with a small event rate. While following the standard of a cluster randomized trial [20], the research questions and study design meet all conditions proposed by the Council of Medical Sciences to obtain a waiver of informed consent [21], and therefore, the study was approved by the Provincial Ethics Board without the requirement for individual patient consent (Clinical Trials Ontario). This vanguard study was not powered to draw conclusions on clinical outcomes, and therefore, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two wound dressing strategies were expected. Sensitivity analysess investigating heterogeneity of the treatment effect by site or only including on-treatment patients to account for the low rate of adherence to Prevena, did not show a statistically significant difference either. Generally, the assessment of SSI can be challenging, and correct interpretation of case vignettes varies [22,23]. Agreement among blinded adjudicators for deep and organ-space s-SSIs was previously shown to be high [24], and was successfully demonstrated in our vanguard study. Blinded adjudication may be important to overcome the risk of bias from subjective outcomes in unblinded trials [25]. In this pilot/vanguard, there was unanimous agreement on the primary outcome among the outcome adjudication committee members, and the agreement between sites and the adjudication committee was substantial and similar to previous reports for deep infection [24]. Disagreement within the adjudication committee was noticed for superficial infections, which supports the choice of deep/organ-space infections as a primary outcome given the higher level of subjectivity for superficial incisional infections. This vanguard trial has several limitations. First, the trial was stopped after the vanguard phase due to lack of additional funding, hence, it was not powered to draw conclusions on treatment effects. Second, even if most probable of negligible relevance, the trial was repeatedly paused during the COVID-19 pandemic at one site, prolonging the recruitment phase. Reasons for the interruption were lack of study staff or outstanding Prevena resupply during the pandemic and awaiting a protocol amendment to increase recruitment number at the site. In conclusion, conducting the study as planned with a 2x2 factorial cross-over design was feasible. However, adherence to one of the interventions, the Prevena negative wound management system, was lower than expected and suggested that an eventual full trial needs to be simplified with all patients regardless of their individual risk factors to be managed the same way in a given study period. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s002 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s003 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s004 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s005 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s006 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s007 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s008 (CSV) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s009 (TXT) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s010 (PDF)

Title: Pandemic Horde is Shutting Down, Key Corps to Fold into The Initiative

Full Content:
The word out this morning is Pandemic Horde is giving up on whatever plans they may have had and are shutting down, with the remaining central corporations in the alliance, Blessed Beans, Horde Vanguard, Horde Armada, and Coolbeans, joining The Initiative. The announcement on Discord, as posted on Reddit. The closure announcement For those unable to read the tiny text, this is a transcription of the announcement: Johnny Trousersnake – 20:05 @everyone Update Hello friends. Last month we announced a plan to leave coalitions behind and work towards being an independent entity. They say plans never survive contact with the enemy, and as you know, ours didn’t survive the ping. There has been a lot of uncertainty since then – and people want a long-term home, and more space to live and play in. An extended stay in purgatory while attempting a rebuild and navigating today’s political landscape is something we no longer feel is feasible, nor would it be in our players’ best interests. With that in mind, we will be shuttering Pandemic Horde and closing the Alliance. We have been in contact with your CEOs over the past week to discuss this. Several Corporations, including the core of Bless, Armada, Cool Beans and VG will be joining INIT, with others following their own paths. I want to re-assure everyone that regardless of destination, standings and docking access will be maintained for all Corporations during this transition. This will not be a repeat of last month. We’d also like to address asset safety costs which has been a constant pain point for everyone. In just a moment, we’re going to assign every member of every ESI corp that stuck with us over the past month, enough Gobloons to withdraw the most expensive ship from each Dronelands doctrine from asset safety. We hope this helps out. Asset Safety Gobloons were assigned to your ‘main’ on Square. If you do not see them, please double check all of your characters. If you think you may have been missed, please contact one of these names on Discord and specify your character name: [names omitted] Gobloons are the SRP currency used by Pandemic Horde. Participation in operations earns them and you can cash them in for ISK for ship loss reimbursement. Or that is my understanding of the mechanism. So they will be issuing Gabloons to members to convert to ISK to help them get their most expensive hull out of asset safety. Given that asset safety jumped from around 2.5 trillion ISK every month to 19.5 trillion ISK in November, according to the November MER, those Gabloons are probably not going to stretch very far. Back on October 11th of this year Pandemic Horde had 48K capsuleers in its ranks and held 414 systems, making in the second largest alliance in null sec. Top 10 Sov Holding Alliances by Member Count – Oct 11 Then came the collapse, the botched evacuation from the Drone regions, the betrayal of long time allies, and the lack of any real plan for the future, during which two thirds of its members left or were kicked from the alliance. Pandemic Horde Collapse charts – Dec 11, 2025 Even then, sitting with around 16K members, it could have been a power in null sec. But that requires competent and motivated leadership, something the alliance has lacked for some time now. 16K well led pilots can carve out space to live in null sec. 16K capsuleers without leadership are just an aimless mob that will accomplish nothing. So it goes. The Initiative had previously accepted some corporations from Pandemic Horde during the collapse, and offered some temporary space Cloud Ring to what remained of the alliance in order to figure out what to do next. That wasn’t supposed to be a permanent situation, but with a leaderless alliance sleeping on your couch with no hope of survival on its own at this point, I suppose the answer was to either drive them out with a stick or take in the refugees on a more permanent basis. It isn’t often you see an alliance collapse. With even a semblance of a core and some leadership, alliances in much worse positions have come back. TEST has been driven out of its space a few times now and is still lurking… safely under the protective wing of Fraternity to be sure, but they are still around. This move will bulk up The Initiative by nearly 4K more pilots. The remaining 12K pilots left in the alliance… which includes the spy ridden Pandemic Horde Inc and its 8K members, half of what remained of the alliance… will need to figure out their own path. Long time members might be accepted into the four corporations that are merging into The Initiative. And The Initiative may take some additional corps. They already have 24, what difference would a few more make at this point? I listened to some of the town hall they had for the announcement. The message itself was pretty terse, limited pretty much to what was in the written announcement. Most of the 45 minutes was Q&A about what to do next. I am sure it was pretty dejecting for line members, one more indignity on top of almost two months of such failings. I have been covering my own interaction with events in a series of posts if you want some more back story. What happens next remains to be seen. The closure plan is set to be completed almost immediately according to the town hall. At least the whole thing will be commemorated in an special item that you can find as part of the Winter Nexus event. Gone but never forgotten now… Meanwhile, while The Initiative has always been a strong group, part of their strength has been their agility. They are now in the same weight class as their current opponent, Fraternity. Whether the additional pilots help them in their campaign or if their integration into the organization becomes a burden remains to be seen. Related: Huh.. I guess we won. I’m gonna go ahead and still say “we” despite not having played the game in 6 years. LikeLike Good riddance to unironic trash. LikeLike I agree with good riddance. An empire that exists to collect rent and retreat from the enemy deserves to go away. Blah, blah, blah, it’s bad for the members, it’s just a game and they’ll get over it and move on. The biggest downside is the more-than-usual moaning and hand wringing about the mythical blue donut that has been about to ruin nullsec for the last 15 years and This One Event is going to make it real This Time. Again. It’s the second most tired trope after “Eve is dying.” LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!
