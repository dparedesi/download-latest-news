August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner.

Citron Research founder Andrew Left analyzes the state of the U.S. market and the wider economy on 'The Claman Countdown.' Warren Buffett is helping revive shares of beleaguered UnitedHealthcare Group after taking a $1.6 billion stake in the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. UnitedHealth shares clocked the largest one-day percent increase since March 2020, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. It was on pace for the best day in 17 years before giving back some of those gains. For the week, shares rose over 21%, the best week since May 2009. Still, the stock is down more than 50% over the past 12 months. Investors, taking a cue from Buffett’s interest in healthcare, also piled into Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares and The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(Photographer: Houston Cofield/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is known for taking positions in businesses it believes will perform over the long term and that have become, in some cases, undervalued. The healthcare giant has been plagued by a Department of Justice probe and the fallout from the fatal shooting of executive Brian Thompson outside the Midtown Hilton Hotel in New York City last year. The brazen killing turned a critical spotlight onto the nation’s healthcare insurance system. Luigi Mangione has been charged with murdering Thompson. FAMILY OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO SUSPECTED KILLER HAS BIG BUSINESS EMPIRE This 2017 file photo of Brian Thompson was released via Businesswire when he was named Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Unit in 2017. (Businesswire / Fox News) The stock helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average cinch a new record, heading for its first record close of 2025, and gave the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) a lift in tandem.

Title: 24/7 Market News: "Our Pipeline Is Roaring" VENU Breaks Out and Expanding National Footprint
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/15/3134197/0/en/24-7-Market-News-Our-Pipeline-Is-Roaring-VENU-Breaks-Out-and-Expanding-National-Footprint.html

August 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that momentum is rapidly building around Venu Holding Corporation (NYSE American: VENU)(“VENU”), a developer and operator of premium live music amphitheaters and hospitality destinations, announced its Q2 2025 financial results, after yesterday’s market close, during an earnings call that highlighted a surge in asset growth, record fan engagement, and expanded national momentum. “As we close out his quarter, we’re seeing the pieces come together, for what’s going to be a defining moment in our growth history. While our attention, this quarter, has heavily been on our balance sheet, it’s all with the P&L in mind,” exclaimed J.W. Roth, VENU’s Founder, Chairman & CEO. Roth later stated, “Here’s the deal, our growth is guided by four clear priorities. First, expanding our markets across the nation. Second, bringing current developments over the finish line and packing their calendars with great content. Third, growing our FireSuite sales with a focus on high impact triple net transactions that go straight on to our balance sheet. And finally, unlocking strategic value, through high value opportunities, like naming rights and sale lease backs.” Financial and Strategic Highlights: The Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs hosted 35,000+ fans across its first 10 shows this season, generating $4.7 million in gross receipts with an average ticket price of $135. Net revenue from amphitheater operations and naming rights totaled $597,712 for the quarter. Development Pipeline and Capital Strategy: “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area. To accelerate these agreements, we have a strong partnership with industry leader, Ryan, LLC. This three-year partnership is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter and, on average, we can expect to add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet, with each delivered development agreement.” Additionally, VENU’s triple-net lease partnership with Sands Investment Group, announced in May, has exceeded expectations, with demand far surpassing initial forecasts. Based on early momentum, the program is projected to generate over $100 million in additional annual capital, creating a powerful new revenue stream alongside traditional FireSuite sales. “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund all of our expansion; partially through public private partnerships, partially through the sale of our FireSuites, and then toward the end of every project, the sale leaseback of the ground underneath the development. The current opportunity is intended to complete the financing of our entire project and will likely result in a development profit,” said Roth. “We have been presented with a significant opportunity to activate sale leaseback sale opportunities. Once completed and accepted, the current one is expected to generate $188 million and a development profit of roughly $35 million in the fourth quarter of this year, with another $35 million expected in the fourth quarter of 2026.” Institutional Confidence Is Rising: Vanguard Makes Its Move With a current market capitalization exceeding $600 million, VENU is officially no longer a micro-cap, marking a transformative milestone that opens the door to increased institutional ownership, broader analyst coverage, and potential inclusion in small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600. One of the clearest signs of VENU’s growing credibility on Wall Street is that Vanguard Group, one of the world’s largest asset managers, disclosed a new position in VENU. According to its Q2 2025 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Vanguard now holds 861,911 shares, representing approximately 2.3% of VENU’s outstanding stock, with a market value of about $13 million. Vanguard becomes one of the first two major institutions to establish a position in VENU, paving the way for what is likely to be many more, as this development significantly broadens the potential investor base to include many mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance company portfolios. “If Q2 proved anything, it’s that the foundation is set and we are roaring ahead. The fans are getting what they always deserved, our model is working, municipalities are hungry, momentum is real and the market is ours to take. In closing, everything that we’ve been working on is pointing to a development profit in the fourth quarter of this year and operationally profit in the third quarter/fourth quarter of 2026,” Roth added. Strategic Partnerships Driving Scale: Roth concluded, “The future that we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months and, if Q2 is any sign, we’ve laid the foundation for things to come.” A replay of the call is available through August 14, 2026, at: https://investors.venu.live.
