Title: 15 Top Colleges For Launching Your Career

ByMaria Gracia Santillana Linares, Forbes Staff. Last year, 105,092 students applied to Northeastern University in Boston, up 63% from 2020. Just 5.6% were admitted– in line with the rates at Ivy League schools Dartmouth College (5.4%) and Brown University (5.65%). Northeastern’s allure isn’t a colonial era pedigree, top 50 ranking (it’s No. 113 on Forbes’ America’s Top Colleges list), or cheap list price (the cost of attendance this year tops $94,000). Instead, Northeastern has become a hot ticket because of its pioneering co-op program (established in 1909), which now integrates six-months or so of full-time work experience, as well as job-application and placement guidance into the academic experience. “Students are seeing that having this cooperative experience and this work experience is turbocharging their peers’ entrance into the workforce,” says Jane Swift, former governor of Massachusetts and president of Education at Work, a nonprofit that connects students with part-time jobs at big companies while they’re still in school. It’s a tough time, job wise, to be a new college grad. For the past few years, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates (age 22 to 27), has been uncharacteristically higher than for workers as a whole, though still markedly lower than for young folks who haven’t earned a bachelor’s degree. As of mid-year, 4.8% of recent grads were unemployed, compared with 4% of all workers and 7.4% of young workers without college degrees. According to one private survey, just 30% of 2025 college grads (down from 41% of 2024 grads) had found full time jobs related to their degrees by the summer, with almost half of the newest grads saying they felt unprepared to even apply for entry-level jobs in their field. The National Association of Colleges & Employers, in its annual May survey, found 2025 graduates had received an average of just 0.78 job offers each, down from 1.13 for the class of 2023 and 0.84 for the class of 2024. Adding to this grim picture are indications that the weak job market may be more than a cyclical dip–that it might, in fact, reflect a structural change, with artificial intelligence starting to eat into entry-level jobs for new college graduates. Even some of those who followed the advice of just a few years ago, and studied computer science, are having a hard time finding jobs, unless they have AI expertise. All this is crucial and unsettling news for current high school seniors, now making the decision of whether to attend college, and if so, which one. For those applying, priorities are shifting. “A few years ago students were much more focused on college experiences, like the opportunities to go abroad. Now they’re focused on return on their investment,” says Anjali Bhatia, CEO of college advising firm Collegewise. In other words, post-grad employment opportunities are now front and center in the college search and decision. That’s why Forbes has created a new list of 15 Top Colleges For Launching Your Career. All are also honorees on our list of America’s 500 Top Colleges, but vary in their focus, selectivity, geographic location and ranking. What they share is a commitment to preparing students to successfully enter the workforce. The 15 are listed in alphabetical order. Ten of the schools offer what might be considered co-op programs for all students, which are still quite rare–only about 25 of the top 500 have these semester-long, full-time work programs integrated into their curriculum. (And only two, Kettering University in Michigan and Wentworth Institute of Technology in Massachusetts, require that all students complete a co-op to graduate.) That means prospective students need to look more widely, and consider a college’s record when it comes to encouraging internships and forming alliances with employers that increase the chances for internships and/or post-graduation employment. Here’s the key: This isn’t about getting any old job after graduation, but getting a good job that launches a successful career related to a student’s interests and education. A report last year by the Burning Glass Institute and The Strada Foundation, found that five years after graduation, students who had completed internships during their college years were nearly 50% less likely to be underemployed (meaning stuck in a job that doesn’t really require a college degree). The study also found that a graduate’s first job is crucial; those who start in a college-level job rarely slide into underemployment. Not surprisingly, internships are getting ever more competitive. Average applications per internship posting on Handshake, a college-focused job postings board, have more than doubled in the last year, in part because students are applying for work opportunities earlier in their education–some even, as freshman and sophomores. “Nowadays multiple internships are a must-have and students recognize that,” says Christine Cruzvergara, Handshake’s chief education strategy officer. Meanwhile, the number of internship postings on Handshake has been declining modestly (by 15% between January 2023 and January 2025). About 95% of jobs posted on Handshake are paid opportunities. (Some schools, recognizing the importance of completing an internship, provide grants or scholarships to help cover students’ living costs if they’re doing unpaid summer internships.) Our America’s Top Colleges ranking is based entirely on a wide set of outcome-based metrics, including graduation rates, earnings, how much debt students graduate with and how many alumni go on to have distinguished careers. Our selection of top schools for career preparation took account of a narrower group of metrics, including participation in co-ops and internships; median salaries three years after graduation; and post-graduation employment rates. According to Handshake, just 41% of undergraduates complete an internship or co-op program before graduation; the majority of our picks have rates above 70%, with three at 100%. To compile our list of 15 schools, Forbes also spoke with career counselors, recruiters and students. Not surprisingly, salary levels on this list differ dramatically, with graduates of tech and business focused schools (e.g. Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Institute of Technology and Babson College) earning considerably more than those who attended Berea College, which sends many of its grads into service-oriented careers. The point, after all, is to prepare students to find the work they want to do. These 15 institutions take a variety of different approaches, including requiring (or at least promoting) internships or co-ops for all students; providing extensive interview and resume training; providing grants for career prep needs; and even helping students get entry level part-time jobs while in school. But they all prioritize giving students tangible work experiences before they graduate and a leg up on the career ladder. Here’s a description of what stands out about each of our picks. With by far the largest undergraduate population on our list, Arizona State University (ASU) uses a range of approaches to launch its students into good jobs. Its career service office offers virtual classes on personal branding at work, networking and using AI for job searches, as well as resume reviews, internship application workshops and one-on-one career meetings. The school also partners with Swift’s Education at Work to place students into part-time “mid-skill” jobs that don’t require a college degree but do produce money for college and useful (and in the best case, relevant) work experience. Some ASU students, for example, have been hired as customer support representatives at Intuit Inc. (owner of TurboTax). It’s a good opportunity for accounting or finance students looking to become tax specialists to make contacts in the industry, points out Swift. Arizona State ranks No. 111 on our Top Colleges list. Known for its entrepreneurship program, Babson is a top choice for students looking to enter the business world or start their own ventures. Job prep at Babson goes well beyond internships, which 85% of students complete before graduation. During their junior or senior year, all students take an Advanced Experiential course that includes applied projects done in the field at companies or nonprofits. The course provides students both tangible work they can point to in later job interviews and a network of future employers. The school’s career focus pays off: 87% of Babson graduates are employed within six months of graduation. While Babson is ranked 95th among Forbes’ 500 Top Colleges, it’s in the top ten on alumni salary (which makes up 20% of our overall college rankings). Graduates earn a median of $90,600 three years after graduation, which rises to a median of $181,400 by 20 years after graduation, according to Payscale. No student at this small Kentucky liberal arts college has to pay tuition thanks to its Tuition Promise Scholarship, which is why this school comes in second on Forbes’ ranking of private colleges with the most generous financial aid. (On America’s Top Colleges, it’s No. 321.) Founded in 1855, the college started with a mission to serve the poor in Appalachia, a mission that has expanded to include students from all over the country. Berea college students must work at least 10 hours a week (on campus, or with employer partners) during the semester as part of their tuition scholarship program. Additionally, 62% of undergraduates participated in summer internships to complement their coursework in the 2023-2024 academic year. Career development support at Berea goes beyond networking opportunities and application support. The school gives juniors and seniors up to $400 to purchase professional clothes and awards $1,000 to seniors who have secured a job, grad school position or a gap year to help them transition to life after college. Earnings three years after graduation are a comparatively modest $52,800, according to Payscale. A member of Forbes’ New Ivies (which honors 20 schools that churn out smart graduates employers love) for both years that list has been published, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is known for its strong computer science and engineering programs. A proactive career placement office helps too. While most majors don’t require an internship to graduate, the school’s career center offers freshman and sophomore career classes and special underclassmen-only recruiting fairs (both in-person and online). Its D-Cubed sessions help students map out different career paths. Though CMU is a top research institution with a heavy reliance on graduate students, more undergraduates participate in summer internships than summer research; in 2025, 746 summer internships were reported to the school versus 197 research positions. CMU graduates earn a median of $100,500 three years after graduation, according to Payscale. That’s the highest of the 15 schools on this list and among the highest on Forbes’ Top Colleges list, where CMU ranks 43rd overall. While its co-op competitor Northeastern boasts an international program, Drexel, which got into the co-op game back in 1919, focuses on placing students with employers within the tri-state area (that’s Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware). The Vanguard Group, Johnson & Johnson, and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia are among the big name employers hiring Drexel students for co-ops. Nearly all students (95%) take at least one internship or co-op placement before they graduate, earning a median of $22,000 for the six months they work. Co-op placements are done in six-month increments, followed by six-months of classes, though certain arts management majors can take summer-only co-ops. Participating helped 84% of the class of 2024 land a job within six months of graduation, the third-highest rate on our list. High school seniors discouraged by Northeastern’s low admissions rate can look to Drexel, which admits 70% of applicants. On our Top Colleges list, Drexel ranks 185th. Georgia Tech, as it’s known, is, like Carnegie Mellon, a two-time honoree on Forbes’ New Ivies list. While co-ops are not required at the Georgia Institute of Technology, students wishing to participate in the program sign up to complete three co-op terms—at least two long fall or spring semesters—and receive an additional designation at graduation. These co-ops must be done with the same company, according to the school’s handbook, as part of its commitment to deepening students’ relationships with employers. In fact, 34% of the class of 2024 accepted full-time offers from their co-op employers, while 73% were already employed by graduation. Internships, however, remain the most popular option. As Forbes described in a story here, Georgia Tech is a state school that takes seriously its mission to serve state residents. It has prioritized job placement and building relationships with employers over remaining small and exclusive. As a result, the school accepted 30% of in-state applicants to the class of 2029. Out-of-staters will find it tougher—the admission rate for them is just 9%. Georgia Tech has climbed to #32 on our overall list, making it No. 7 on Forbes’ Top 25 Public Colleges list. This small school in Flint, Michigan, ranked No. 218 on Forbes Top Colleges list, was first known as “General Motors Institute” due to its strong ties to the automotive industry. Since its founding in 1919, Kettering’s focus on experiential learning has translated into a 50/50 workplace and classroom education, where all students must participate in at least one co-op starting in their first year. By the time they collect their diploma after five years of study, they’ve already amassed 2.5 years of work experience and earned between $55,000 and $75,000. “Don’t focus on the college experience,” Dr. Robert McMahan, president of Kettering University, told a Forbes contributor in June, describing his advice to students. “Focus instead on likely outcomes ten years out.” Added McMahan: “The extent to which higher education fails to understand itself as part of the workforce supply-chain is the extent to which it will continue to drift into irrelevance.” This leader in co-op programs, ranked No. 113 on Forbes’ list of top colleges, has been focusing on experiential learning since it started the program in 1909. Its campus is in the heart of Boston, but Northeastern has a global orientation–4,700 employers in 158 countries have taken in students for co-ops. Though not technically required to graduate, most Northeastern students do complete at least one co-op or internship before they graduate, with 70% of the class of 2024 choosing to complete two semester-long co-ops. Within nine months of graduation, 82% of that class had a job. Since 2018, Rensselaer, ranked No. 170 on the Top Colleges list, has required a semester of experiential learning, during which students take a career development class (at no extra tuition cost) and also do one of the following: an internship, a co-op, work at a non-profit, study abroad, or 260 hours of research. The class includes not only application how-tos, but also networking tips, simulations and visits from employers. Recruiters take different approaches in their visits, from formal presentations to interactive networking sessions, steps that have been key in students’ applying their techniques, according to Philip Bruce, assistant vice provost of experiential learning. “Those that bring Legos are by far the most popular with students,” he quips. But the results are nothing to joke about: Before the experiential semester became mandatory, the number of graduates employed or in graduate school within six months after graduation hovered in the high 70s to mid 80s, according to Bruce. That number has been over 90% since. Only four colleges at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)—Engineering; Engineering Technology; Computing and Informational Science; and Business—require students to participate in at least one co-op semester before graduation, but the opportunity is open to all students. Oracle, Raytheon and Nike are among the big-name companies that hire students on co-op from this private research institution, which is No. 195 on our Top Colleges list. Inside the classroom, RIT’s “New Economy” majors also emphasize career-ready studies with majors that combine design, computing, digital media or psychology. It’s all part of what helps graduates quickly land full-time employment: 88% of the class of 2024 employed within six months of graduation, the highest among the universities on our list. The university’s renewed interest in business programs has students flocking to this school, where admissions rates have dropped by nearly half in the last five years to 18% for the class entering this past fall. While Herbert Business School students have access to their own internship job boards and preparation, the university’s Toppel Career Center offers all students a variety of work experiences, from micro-internships to project-based work during the semester, as well as career crawls with on-site visits with university alumni and job-simulation courses. About 82% of all undergraduates participate in one pre-professional experience before graduation, with 97% of them being paid. The university, ranked 76th on Forbes’ Top Colleges list, also partners with JCPenney twice a year to offer discounted professional clothing. One of the largest Hispanic-serving institutions, The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), has long focused on research opportunities. But as budget and grant cuts hamper research growth across the country, the school has expanded its partnership with nonprofit Education at Work, to help students gain work experience, while offsetting some of the costs of their tuition. The program began with a pilot back in 2021 with UTEP students working as customer service representatives with Discover’s consumer financial team. It’s now expanded to include roles at Intuit and First Financial Bank. “Their focus has been on how do you use work-based learning to teach soft skills” and put them in practice, says Education at Work’s Swift. UTEP, No. 359 on the Forbes list, also offers career coaching, resumé reviews and career fairs. The University of Washington, which ranks No. 50 on the top colleges list, has gone all in on the latest career preparation tools. Through its career center, students have free access to Jobscan, an AI-powered job application website; Yoodli, an AI-speech coach; and Forage, a website where students can practice on-the-job scenarios and earn certificates. The four-to-six hour scenarios include preparing presentations for consulting firm BCG and the marketing department of Pfizer. Since many of the university’s students go to work in highly technical roles in large companies—for the Class of 2024, software engineer was the most popular job title, with Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft among the top five employers for the class—the career center offers specific advising sessions on understanding non-disclosure agreements for internships or research projects. Overall, 71% of students complete an internship before graduation. Now celebrating the 50th anniversary of its co-op program, Wentworth requires all undergraduate students to complete two co-ops before graduating. By working full-time for two semesters and taking classes for two summers, students are still able to graduate in four years. The real-life work experience helps with post-graduation employment: 73% of students are employed within six months of graduation. Students with entrepreneurial ambitions can fulfill their co-op requirements by working on their own startup with some help from the school, which provides up to $9,000 to replace the wages they would otherwise earn and up to $2,500 in materials for the semester-long program. The small school, in Boston’s Fenway neighborhood, weighs in at No. 328 on Forbes’ overall list. With Wentworth’s unusual hands-on practical approach, construction management is its most popular major. A focus on internships and career preparation has helped the College of William and Mary battle enrollment challenges, according to Collegewise’s Bhatia. On average, more than half of undergraduate students participate in at least one internship or co-op experience before they graduate from this relatively small public research university, which is ranked No. 60 overall and was honored on the Forbes New Ivies list in both 2024 and 2025. Chartered in 1693 by King William III and Queen Mary II of England as a “College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good Arts and Sciences,’’ the school also promotes volunteer work and its externships (where students spend one to two days shadowing top professionals in various fields), have been growing rapidly. The school provides funding for unpaid and low paid internships, so more students can participate in experiential learning.
