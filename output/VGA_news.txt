The market landscape remains fragmented, with the top ten competitors holding a combined 24.15% share in 2023. BASF SE led the sector with a 3.57% market share, closely followed by players like Armacell International Holding GmbH and Lydall Inc. Product segmentation includes cellular, fibrous, flake, granular, reflective, and other types, with cellular being the largest segment (50.73% in 2024) and reflective expected to show the fastest growth (CAGR of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029). In terms of application, storage tanks represented the largest segment (36.75% in 2024), while the terminals segment promises rapid growth (CAGR 6.96%). The energy and power industry remains the primary end-use sector, with the anticipated accelerated growth at a CAGR of 7.25% by 2029. Significant opportunities exist across segments, particularly in the cellular market (projected $1.3 billion gain by 2029) and storage tanks ($1.0 billion). The energy segment alone could see a $1.14 billion increase by 2029. Notably, China is poised to gain $606.38 million within the sector. Strategic approaches for market players include developing partnerships to enhance innovation, advancing hydrogen storage solutions, and launching high-performance insulation panels. Companies are advised to implement pricing strategies, expand digitally, and leverage partnerships for added value.

June 24, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: E Ink E Ink BILLERICA, Mass., June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- E Ink (8069.TW) the originator, pioneer, and global commercial leader in electronic paper (ePaper) technology, today announced, in collaboration with Oricom Co., Ltd., a vanguard in the Japan ad agency scene, the next-generation advertising medium via the Sustainable Board. Featuring E Ink’s most vivid color ePaper, Spectra TM 6, Oricom will produce the Sustainable Board as a new channel for advertisers, offering an unprecedented, environmentally conscious advertising method. The product is an innovative, sustainability-dedicated medium for companies using Oricom’s brand, Mirapale. While being conscious of energy consumption, it actively communicates sustainable priorities and initiatives. Sustainable Board is ultra-low-power digital signage that uses E Ink’s ePaper technology. E Ink’s Spectra 6 offers a wide viewing angle similar to paper and enables vivid color expression like a print-quality poster. Because it’s a reflective display that doesn’t use a backlight, it achieves especially high sunlight readability. Additionally, it only requires power when content is updated, and image content remains visible once displayed without consuming any energy. This allows for substantial energy savings compared to conventional displays. Moreover, signage products equipped with E Ink’s ePaper, which boasts these features, can operate on batteries or renewable energy sources like solar. This makes it possible to choose their installation locations with more flexibility and mobility in mind. “We are very grateful to collaborate with Oricom, a leader in the advertising industry, in the electronic paper signage area,” said JM Hung, Vice President of Business Center at E Ink. “As we enter an era of global environmental preservation and environmentally conscious solutions are increasingly sought, our ePaper is a display technology that aligns with a more environmentally-friendly future. Through our collaboration with Oricom, we are confident we can contribute to advancing SDG activities in society.” Expected installation sites range from company receptions, lobbies, and showrooms to commercial facilities and tourist destinations. This product is recognized as a novel method that aligns corporate branding with environmental responsiveness by making sustainability tangible. Providing sustainable advertising mediums will generate a new market in the advertising industry. Oricom intends to promote broader Sustainable Development Goals by enabling companies and local governments to leverage this environmentally conscious advertising platform. “Amidst the expansion of corporate activities with a long-term vision, prioritizing environmental protection and social responsibility, advertising is similarly called upon to contribute from this perspective,” said Akemi Nakajima, President of Oricom. “We developed the Sustainable Board alongside E Ink as a specific method for this. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen the relationship between both companies, supporting corporate growth while contributing to realizing a sustainable society.” E Ink’s ePaper draws power only when the screen updates, and no energy-hungry backlight is required. This ultra-efficient, non-emissive design reduces both electricity use and carbon footprint versus paper or LCDs. Guided by its PESG (Product, Environment, Social, and Governance) framework, E Ink delivers low-carbon solutions that speed the world’s sustainable transition. FTSE Russell classifies 99.9 % of the company’s revenue as green, and Moody’s has confirmed E Ink’s loans align with global Green Loan Principles—clear proof of its industry-leading environmental performance. Installation trials at major stations in Japan are underway for Sustainable Board. The future goal is to expand into places with high advertising needs, such as commercial facilities. About E InkE Ink Holdings Inc. (8069.TWO), based on technology from MIT's Media Lab, provides an ideal display medium for applications spanning eReaders and eNotes, retail, home, hospital, transportation, logistics, and more, enabling customers to put displays in locations previously impossible.

Title: Young Investor Demand for Alternative Assets Is Reshaping Wall Street's Playbook

The financial industry is rushing to keep up with millennials' and Gen Z's interest in pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles and more. June 23, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street has a new favorite investor. They’re young, they’re affluent and they’re skeptical that traditional markets can deliver wealth over the long haul. Shaped by financial crises and fueled by tech optimism, this well-heeled class of Millennials and Gen Z are moving their money into the buzzy world of alternative assets. Think pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles, and more. From private banks to fintech platforms, the financial industry is rushing to keep up. Firms like Forge Global Holdings Inc. have lowered their minimum investment thresholds, pitching private-market access as aspirational — and attainable. At Bank of America Corp., the number of retail clients holding alternative assets has more than doubled since 2020, and the firm adds about 50 new funds to its platform each year. Nearly three-quarters of wealthy investors under 43 believe a traditional stock-bond portfolio will fail to generate above-average returns, according to BofA’s biennial study last year. About 93% plan to increase allocations to alternatives in the coming years. The irony for Wall Street’s old guard: many in this alt-loving crowd are turning away from the very public markets that helped build their wealth in the first place. Related:RIAs and the Evolving Landscape of Private Wealth “Investor preferences are changing at the same time that the markets are evolving,” said Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank. “Those two dynamics are at play that are feeding off of each other.” The demand is reshaping how Wall Street pitches wealth-generating products. What used to be institutional is now increasingly being redesigned for individuals, albeit the well-connected and well-funded. Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are among investment firms repackaging their once-elite strategies for the masses into ETFs and semi-liquid funds. The 60/40 model — allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds — delivered respectable gains over much of the past decade. But its appeal has dimmed since 2022’s inflation-driven rout, as both assets began moving in lockstep, eroding the diversification benefit of the strategy. “Some advisors may have just used the 60/40 portfolio over time and haven’t really felt the need to offer something in the way of alternatives,” said Mark Steffen, global alternative investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “But I think that’s probably changing.” Supply is on the rise. A CAIS survey shows 80% of alternative managers plan to launch retail-friendly products and structures, nearly double from three years ago. Morgan Stanley, for instance, just filed to offer a multi-asset vehicle designed to provide exposure to everything from venture capital to private debt, real estate and infrastructure — all in one fund. Related:The WealthStack Podcast: Unlocking Private Markets with AssetMark's Michael Kim Many investors are opting into complex, costly, and often illiquid structures — even as the long-term payoff remains uncertain. Compared to tax-efficient ETFs, these alternative products tend to carry higher fees, greater opacity, and less liquidity. Blackstone’s flagship real-estate trust, for example, hit withdrawal limits during the 2022 interest-rate spike. With private equity and credit poised to trail public markets for a third year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists recently advised their clients to reduce exposure to both assets. A separate academic study has labeled alts “costly and wasteful.” And Moody’s Corp. warned the push to open private markets to the retail crowd carries “systemic implications,” such as growing liquidity risks. Yet none of this is deterring industry fans in the era of get-rich-quick antics amplified on social media from TikTok to Reddit. “I can tell you it’s most often easier to convince an entrepreneur to put money into a 1-in-10 shot startup than it is to get them to park money in a conservative, long-term strategy,” said Brian Werner, chief investment officer at Winthrop Partners. Related:Carlyle Makes New Retail Fund Push to Buy and Sell PE Stakes Earlier this year, when Forge cut the minimum investment on selected offerings to $5,000, daily sign-ups more than tripled. Executives say the surge largely came from young users riding the AI wave — hoping to access firms like OpenAI before an IPO. Part of the appeal is cultural FOMO — the chance to signal early participation in the next major tech boom. “A lot of them have a tech background, so they’re playing in their own sandbox with stuff that they know,” said Andrew Saeta, co-head of US capital markets at Forge. “The stocks-and-bonds model of our parents isn’t necessarily getting the job done in their eyes, especially with everything being so expensive.” While the trend appears most pronounced among Millennial and Gen Z types, it’s pulling in a broader cohort. Chad Blackburn, an accounting executive in Nashville, Tennessee, started buying equities in his teens. Today, the 45-year-old largely avoids stocks and bonds, putting most of his capital into startup firms and — yep — Bitcoin. “The dotcom bubble and great financial crisis forced me to think more deeply about my investments,” he said. “Why would I limit myself to just stocks and bonds, especially when a lot of this stuff is not nearly as diversified as you think?” For many, alts aren’t just about returns, they’re a form of rebellion. Even among those who have benefited from the market’s gains, there’s a lingering distrust in the institutions that helped deliver them. They view public markets and 60/40 strategies as fragile or even rigged, having coming of age during the crashes of 2008 and 2020. Real estate, digital currencies, and private equity now rank among the top picks for this emerging wealth class, according to BofA. The appeal is both psychological and financial: these assets are seen as detached from government interference and more likely to deliver big upside. “They think, the system is rigged against me,” said Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management. “I have to do something out of the box in order to get rich.” Read more Wall Street Has a Hot Way to Sell Private Assets to the Masses Apollo, Franklin to Offer Private Assets in Empower 401(k)s Blackstone, Vanguard, Wellington to Launch Private Markets Fund One reason that alternatives are being aggressively repackaged for individuals is that traditional buyers — pensions, endowments, insurers — risk being tapped out. Big institutions allocate about one-fifth of their portfolios to alternatives, according to Preqin. By contrast, individuals in the BofA survey show an allocation of only 7%. But painting alternatives with a broad brush can be misleading. According to Chris Toomey, managing director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, private credit and infrastructure appeal to older investors thanks to the promise of steady cash flows, though for the young cohort, private equity looks more attractive. “They are at a point in their investment cycle where they have the ability to take on that risk,” Toomey said. “They’re early investors and they’ve got a much longer time horizon.” Yet even among the younger generation, the shift in taste isn’t universal. For every investor chasing unicorns on Forge, there are thousands of Millennial and Gen Z savers. According to Vanguard Group Inc., many in this group are sitting on high cash holdings thanks to cash-default IRAs — at the expense of fully investing their capital in diversified portfolios. There’s no monolithic investor and no single truth about alternatives. But the future of wealth management won’t resemble the past — and Wall Street is already rushing to profit from the generational shift. “You’ve got this mix of investor preferences and product availability evolving in a way that they actually compliment each other to create this procyclical uptake in alternative investments,” said BofA’s Pelzar. “We’re probably in the early innings of a real wave.” Lu Wang You May Also Like Celebrating outstanding achievement in support of financial advisor success Jun 27, 2025 Jun 27, 2025 Jun 26, 2025 Sponsored Content Serving the whole client: Why ignoring estate planning is bad for business Sponsored Content The 2025 WealthStack Study: How Technology Is Transforming Wealth Management Growth and Reshaping the Industry Sponsored Content Open Finance in Action: How Data Connectivity Drives Advisory Value Sponsored Content Modernizing Wealth Stewardship | How Trust & Wealth Managers Are Adapting to HNW Family Expectations Featured WMIQ Research Tracking investment and wealth management decision-makers’ views and progress on data modernization.
