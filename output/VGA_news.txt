TORONTO, Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. today announced the estimated annual capital gains distributions for the Vanguard ETFs listed below for the 2024 tax year. This is an update to the estimated annual capital gains distributions announced on November 18, 2024. Please note that these are estimated amounts only, as of December 15, 2024, and could change if the Vanguard ETFs experience subscriptions or redemptions prior to the ex-dividend date. These estimates are for the year-end capital gains distributions only, which will be re-invested and the resulting units immediately consolidated, so that the number of units held by each investor will not change. These estimates do not include estimates of ongoing monthly or quarterly cash distribution amounts, which are reported in a separate press release. The ex-dividend date for the 2024 year-end distributions for these ETFs will be December 30, 2024. The record date will be December 30, 2024 and payable on January 7, 2025. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested capital gains distributions for 2024, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.) in early-2025.

December 19, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Questex LLC Questex LLC LDI 2025 Announced for December 3-9 in Las Vegas NEW YORK, Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Questex’s Live Design International (LDI) 2024 delivered an unforgettable experience, bringing together over 13,000 global live event and entertainment design technology professionals and over 350 exhibitors. Packed with groundbreaking gear and technology, unparalleled education, and industry-defining moments, LDI 2024 proved why it remains the ultimate gathering for live entertainment and production technology. A Milestone Year for LDI 2024Bursting with cutting-edge technology, unmatched education programs, and unforgettable networking opportunities, LDI 2024 reached new heights. The event featured the largest professional training program in its history, a 50% increase in LDInstitute™ classes, more than 125 LDInnovation™ Conference sessions, and a 10% larger exhibit floor showcasing over 350 exhibitors. “LDI 2024 was a vibrant celebration of the creativity, innovation, and community that power the live entertainment industry,” said Jessi Cybulski, Show Director, LDI. “With outstanding professional training, an electric show floor, and countless opportunities to connect, this year’s event exceeded expectations. We can’t wait to see what the industry will create in the coming year and showcase at LDI 2025.” LDI 2024 Highlights: What attendees and sponsors had to say about LDI 2024: “As far as the quality of programming and the quality of showroom floor, it's definitely some of the top memories I'll have when it goes to conferences and attending events,” said Michaela Ternasky-Holland, Creator, Immersive, Spatial, & Interactive Experiences (VR, AR, AI). “It's been really, really great to come back and experience LDI and just seeing the growth that has happened in just a short amount of time, both in the size of the overall event and then also the technology. If you're thinking about coming to LDI or getting into this industry, I would certainly recommend you taking advantage of this amazing opportunity that happens every year. Just great exposure to many of the manufacturers, all of the technology that you see on any of the events that are happening out there is here at the LDI conference. Even better are the people and the relationships that make all the live events in the industry happen. It's all about the people and the products, and it all happens here at LDI,” said Shane Smith, Sr. Director Technology, LMG, Inc. “It’s the perfect opportunity to see a showcase of the latest and greatest in tech, and also network and meet with the movers and shakers who are in this exciting field. As a first-time attendee when the Expo Floor opened, I was like a kid walking into a candy store. It was just incredible. The lights, the sounds, the noises, the people, the technology. Yeah, this is a great experience,” said Brian Crane, Founder, Crane Light & Design. “This is the conference that I go to because all of my friends are here. I was a lighting person back in the day. And this is the place that I come to see all the new technology, the new equipment. And now that I'm working more on the rigging side of things, I get a chance to come and talk about that this year,” said Kristi Ross-Clausen, Director of Education and Training, TheaterHealthandSafety.com. “LDI is a wonderful thing every year where all the vendors come together and you get an opportunity to see all of the new things out there. But, also, it's really a meeting of the minds where you get all the people who are actually creating this cutting-edge technology into one space.

TORONTO, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. today announced the estimated annual capital gains distributions for the Vanguard ETFs listed below for the 2024 tax year. This is an update to the estimated annual capital gains distributions announced on November 18, 2024. Please note that these are estimated amounts only, as of December 15, 2024, and could change if the Vanguard ETFs experience subscriptions or redemptions prior to the ex-dividend date. These estimates are for the year-end capital gains distributions only, which will be re-invested and the resulting units immediately consolidated, so that the number of units held by each investor will not change. These estimates do not include estimates of ongoing monthly or quarterly cash distribution amounts, which are reported in a separate press release. The ex-dividend date for the 2024 year-end distributions for these ETFs is December 24, 2024. The record date for the 2024 annual distributions will be December 24, 2024 and payable on January 3, 2025. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested capital gains distributions for 2024, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.) in early-2025.

Title: House Committee Says It Finds Evidence of ‘Climate Cartel’

The House Judiciary Committee said it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp. board members in 2021 after the company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon led by a firm called Engine No. 1 coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false,” said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so.” Last month, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov. 27. The committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the GOP’s attacks against ESG.
