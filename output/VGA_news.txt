U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. American Electric Power is the parent company of various local electric companies that serve Americans living in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. According to the Nasdaq, this parent company’s top shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. as well. When cross-referencing every electric company that is a member of the Edison Electric Institute, one pattern is easily recognized: BlackRock and Vanguard are the top shareholders of the majority of American electric companies. And like their shareholders, these energy companies support the business of “clean energy.” Ameren, Con Edison, PG&E, WEC Energy, and American Electric Power have all committed to “clean energy” solutions, without offering a long-term plan on how these sources will be maintained for the future. “Clean Energy” waste has yet to be addressed by companies investing in “renewables.” It is a new concept even for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. On their website they note that “some end-of-life solar panels contain enough metals, like lead, to meet the definition of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.” The EPA website also notes the need to update standards for lithium-ion solar battery waste, because “though lithium batteries are generally safe when used, stored, and charged appropriately, these batteries can cause fires when improperly discarded or otherwise mismanaged at the end of their lives.” The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, estimated in 2022 that just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were recycled, adding yet another waste problem for “clean energy.” Add in ecosystem disruption and wildlife loss, and “clean energy” waste is growing into a big problem. Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: Around 70% of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the DRC, and 41% of all batteries containing cobalt are imported from the People’s Republic of China. CECC chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated, “From dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption. ... By ignoring these rights and by treating people including children as expendable, China is committing gross violations of human rights and is seeking to rewrite the international order.” Journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos testified, “I have seen how landscapes have been destroyed, water polluted and air filled with dust and carbon as mining companies rush to extract minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, and phosphates. Oftentimes, human rights abuses go hand in glove with these environmental catastrophes. ... We must also not forget the very real human rights abuses that attend the extraction of battery metals in the DRC. Children are brutalized, women are violated, and men are subject to wage slavery.” “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Title: Ukraine's Battlefield Fights Are Messy. Its Political Battles Are Getting Messy, Too.
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/02/ukraine-250212-rferl01.htm

By Mike Eckel February 12, 2025 The mayor of Ukraine's capital city is feuding with the president. The defense minister is under investigation as part of a bitter fight over control of weapons purchases. Recruiters are struggling to get enough men to the front. Ukrainians are fighting calls to lower the draft age. And last week, two more towns fell to Russian forces, though the losses were more symbolic than tactical. Ukraine is struggling to fight an existential war of defense, trying to hold back the nearly 3-year-old all-out invasion by Russia. Exhausted and battered, the population has mainly continued to rally behind the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But fractures are appearing in the country's leadership and political class. How wide and deep they may become is an open question. Regardless, they come at an inopportune moment for Kyiv, as momentum builds for a cease-fire with Moscow, with Ukraine's main weapons provider, the United States, eager to end the war and diplomacy heating up ahead of the Munich Security Conference this weekend. "These facts tell you that the political process remains active in Ukraine even during the war," said Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at the London-based think tank Chatham House. "There is much hope that there could indeed be a cease-fire and that political competition will restart. It is almost like returning to normal life, to have elections and to have competition." War: A Continuation Of Politics By Other Means On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have been on the back foot for months, going as far back as February 2024. Last August, Ukraine tried to change the narrative, staging an audacious cross-border assault on Russia's Kursk region, the biggest invasion of Russia by foreign troops since World War II. Kyiv hoped it would relieve pressure elsewhere along the front line and prove to its Western backers it was still nimble and capable of battlefield ingenuity. The West was definitely surprised, but Russian troops did not redeploy from elsewhere. Across the autumn and into the winter, Ukraine was forced to steadily retreat in multiple locations. Velyka Novosilka, a southern Donbas town along the meandering river valley, fell to the Russians as Ukrainian officials, on January 27, confirmed the withdrawal of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. A few days later, Russian forces took control of the last remnants of Kurakhove, pushing Ukrainian troops west toward the city of Zaporizhzhya. Major General Mykhaylo Drapatiy, the new commander of Ukraine's ground forces, was ordered to take direct command of the eastern front, a move many saw as a possible indication of how worried commanders might be about defenses. Capital City Wrangling Back in Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, fired a public broadside on January 29, accusing Zelenskyy's presidential office of political intrigue with its choice of a new military administrator for the city. Military administrators have been put in place across the country since the onset of the invasion as a way to streamline coordination between civilian and military authorities. But the appointment of Tymur Tkachenko a month earlier had "political motives," Klitschko asserted, charging that Tkachenko was "interfering in and blocking of economic activity" in the capital. "I am addressing the president of Ukraine," Klitschko said in a video posted to Telegram. "While you, as the supreme commander-in-chief, are focused on the war and the defense of Ukraine, people around you are tirelessly engaged in political intrigue." Tkachenko punched back. "I am not inclined to organize political shows like people who have been in the city government for decades," he said. "We will solve the problems of the city and help the people of Kyiv." Procurement Problems The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is embroiled in pitched bureaucratic warfare over how weaponry is procured for the armed forces. The Defense Procurement Agency was established in 2022 as a way to manage the flood of weaponry -- both from abroad and from within the country -- that Ukraine needs to arm its military. Previously, arms procurement had been dogged by corruption and graft. On January 31, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov dismissed the head of the agency, Maria Bezrukova, accusing her of mismanagement. Bezrukova in turn denied the accusation and claimed Umerov's dismissal order was illegal because the agency's supervisory board had extended her contract. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an independent law enforcement agency, then jumped into the fray, opening an investigation and saying Umerov may have violated the law by not recognizing her contract extension. The turmoil drew concern from the Group of Seven nations: "Compliance with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is essential to maintaining the trust of the public and international partners," they said in a statement. More Men, More Boys Ukraine's battlefield woes stem in large part from its inability to send enough men to bolster exhausted and depleted units struggling to fend off a bigger, better-armed Russian military. Despite passing legislation last year to overhaul the existing system, officials have still struggled to recruit and train enough men. Highlighting the recruiting difficulties is the scandal surrounding the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade, a French-trained and -armed unit that was supposed to be a vanguard of a modernized armed force for Ukraine. Instead, the unit saw scores of men deserting; its commander was relieved of duty just before the unit deployed to the Donbas, and investigators are looking closely at what went wrong. Zelenskyy ordered a halt to the creation of similar brigades. U.S. and other Western officials have called for lowering the conscription age from 25 to 18. Zelenskyy has resisted, fearing it would decimate the country's already fragile demographics, making it impossible to increase the population in the future. Elephant In The Room Looming over all this is the prospect of peace talks. The Trump administration has signaled it will use a mix of coercion and inducements to get Kyiv and Moscow to at least sit down and negotiate. Among the issues on the table: whether Ukraine should suspend martial law to allow for new presidential elections, which have been prohibited since the start of the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy won a five-year term in 2019. A poll published February 3 that asked Ukrainians which public figures they trusted the most found that Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief, topped the list. Since being appointed ambassador to Britain, Zaluzhniy has kept a low political profile, but many see him as a strong contender if there is an election. He was followed in the ranking by Kyrylo Budanov, the sphinx-like head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, and Oleksandr Usyk, who last year won the world heavyweight boxing title. In fourth place: Zelenskyy. Experts say Zelenskyy's political advisers are aware Zaluzhniy would be a formidable rival in an election. Since his move to London, most of the gruff former general's public statements have called for national solidarity in the fight against a foreign enemy. There's also the fear that Russia could meddle in any Ukrainian election -- as it has done in the past. Sergei Zhuk, a fellow at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a professor at Ball State University in Indiana, told RFE/RL in an interview last month that the Kremlin could use its powerful propaganda machine and pro-Russia elements inside Ukraine to destabilize the country during elections. Also lurking in the background: former President Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelenskyy defeated in 2019. Poroshenko's supporters appear to be laying the groundwork for him to run again, although he is still widely unpopular. "There was always this discussion about mobilization, the level of war-time tax, procurement process at the [Defense Ministry], building defenses around power stations," Lutsevych said. "There is unity where it matters in war: about the enemy, and that enemy is Russia." RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.
