As outlined in a written ministerial statement made by Karin Smyth MP, Minister of State for Health (Secondary Care), the Department of Health and Social Care is publishing corrections regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) procurement in the early pandemic. The PPE procurement in the early pandemic page was published alongside a statement to Parliament by the government at the time in November 2021 (with further updates in February 2022). The page and statement describe procurement of PPE during the early months of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The 3 further corrections to the previous publication are: The following lists indicate the corrected range of routes used to identify suppliers as outlined above. The ‘source of referral’ is the individual or team that identified the organisation and the ‘actual referrer’ is the individual or team who directed the offer to the high priority route. These are companies who did not sit on existing frameworks to supply PPE and the Department of Health and Social Care contracted with them in order to ensure the necessary supply of PPE. UK Make, China Buy and the High Priority Lane are all subsets of, and are included in, this.
