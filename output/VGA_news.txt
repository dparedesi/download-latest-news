Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: With 61% institutional ownership, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a favorite amongst the big guns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Altria Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Altria Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Altria Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Altria Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Altria Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Altria Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Altria Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 39% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Altria Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Altria Group (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is the undisputed king of the meme coins, with a market cap of about $56 billion. The coin has been in a roaring rally since late last year, rising by 355%, and, with the Trump administration signaling a serious pro-crypto bent, it's no surprise that investors are interested in making big gains with a purchase. Is it possible to make a decent sum of $10,000 with a timely investment in this meme, even if your starting capital is on the small side? In the closing of the recent trading day, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) stood at $240.91, denoting a +0.25% change from the preceding trading day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 30% in 2024, while Ark Innovation ETF returned 8.4%. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) shares are trading lower on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $36. Halliburton reported a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 2.3% year-over-year to $5.610 billion, missing the consensus of $5.63 billion. Completion and Production revenue fell 4.2% YoY to $3.2 billion, with $629 million operating income. The analyst noted that softer revenue was mainly due to a decline in Completion and Produc Energy Transfer LP (ET) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Advertising revenue doubled this past year, co-CEO Gregory Peters said, and the company expects the same to be true in 2025. Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. Vistra stock was rising Tuesday after authorities lifted evacuation orders issued because of a fire at a company power plant last week. The utility stock gained 8.8% to $185.83 in afternoon trading, on track for an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The fire took place at a lithium-ion battery facility at a Vistra power plant in Moss Landing, Calif. Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Super Micro (SMCI). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store. Sign in to access your portfolio
