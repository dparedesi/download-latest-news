Badri Patarkatsishvili’s family set up a firm to manage his multibillion-dollar fortune after the mustachioed Georgian tycoon died suddenly at his English mansion in 2008. As his heirs fended off opportunists seeking a slice of the billionaire’s assets, the money manager kept a low profile, offering few details of how it handled the wealth he amassed alongside fellow oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s starting to change. The Patarkatsishvilis’ family office, Bili Capital, has revealed more than two dozen bets on funds from some of the biggest names in global finance, including BlackRock Inc. and Ares Management Corp., on a recently launched website. Patarkatsishvili’s 70-year-old widow, Inna, the de facto head of the family after his death, also ceded her stake in the firm within the past year, registry filings show. That move coincides with the resolution of a long-running legal battle over the fortune of Georgia’s one-time richest man, and has separately led to Inna’s son-in-law, Yevhen Hunyak, 51, becoming Bili Capital’s only shareholder. As a result, a second-generation member is now in sole control of one of London’s biggest — and historically most discreet — family offices for the first time. A representative for the Patarkatsishvili dynasty, who describe Bili Capital as a multi-generational family office overseeing more than $1 billion in assets, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The disclosures give rare insight into one of the biggest fortunes to emerge from Russia’s so-called “wild ‘90s” as the country transitioned from communism to a market-based economy. They also make the once-secretive Bili Capital more transparent than many other family offices, whose public profiles often comprise a single-page website with little information. At least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bili Capital’s “transparency on what they’re doing makes them much more accessible, and relatable, to the outside world,” said David Hawkins, founder of Cliveden Advisory, a strategic consulting and reputation-management firm for ultra-wealthy individuals. “They likely want to do more deals.” Bili Capital’s other fund allocations include Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, index-fund pioneer Vanguard and Mubadala-backed Fortress Investment Group. It also oversees direct stakes in a Georgia theme park, a mineral-water company and a real estate developer serving Miami’s Fisher Island enclave for the ultra-wealthy. ‘The Muscle’ Patarkatsishvili began to build his fortune in the early 1990s when he teamed up with Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of that decade, to run car dealership LogoVaz. The pair later partnered with Abramovich to help establish Russian oil giant Sibneft out of state-owned assets, with Berezovsky leveraging his Kremlin connections and Patarkatsishvili keeping business relations running smoothly behind the scenes. “Berezovsky was the public face of their alliance, while Badri was the muscle,” said David Lingelbach, who headed Bank of America Corp.’s Russian operations during the 1990s and is now a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Baltimore. “He’s such an interesting oligarch as everything about him was so opaque. He was one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful – person in Georgia.” In 2001, Abramovich acquired the Sibneft stakes owned by Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky for more than $1 billion after their relationship with the Kremlin soured. Berezovsky later tried unsuccessfully to sue Abramovich over that deal in one of London’s most high-profile legal battles, before he was found dead at his own English mansion in 2013. Abramovich is worth $7.8 billion today, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. Bili Capital’s revamp comes after years of battles over the patriarch’s assets have receded, freeing his heirs to focus on what’s left of the fortune. Since his death, the family has been entangled in several cases, including a $3 billion claim in 2008 by Berezovsky, who alleged that a portion of his former business partner’s holdings — often stashed in secretive tax havens — rightfully belonged to him. Berezovsky withdrew his claim four years later, while the family also successfully fended off a distant relative positioning themselves as Patarkatsishvili’s heir. Another case dating to 2016 wrapped up this year at the UK’s highest court. By some estimates, the family has recovered at least $2 billion of Patarkatsishvili’s assets, though that’s just a fraction of what his overall wealth was believed to be at the time of his death. Branding Strategy Founded in December 2008, Bili Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Ershikov and Chief Financial Officer Ilia Demidov, who both previously worked at Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Like other family offices, the closely held firm isn’t regulated as it doesn’t manage money for external investors, limiting transparency requirements. Allocating to funds instead of striking deals under its own name also allows it to keep a low profile, while its longtime holding entity is in Jersey, a low-tax territory neighboring the UK that offers exemptions from publicly disclosing consolidated accounts. A 2022 job posting for Bili Capital cited further assets including a yacht, a fleet of vehicles and several European homes, underscoring how the firm caters to both the financial affairs and jet-setting lifestyle of its owners. The online post also described the firm developing a “branding” strategy, signaling how it has been considering its public image for years. “Reputational capital is important,” said Hawkins, who also advises family offices. “It’s a necessary form of insurance.” In a section entitled “Meet our family,” Bili Capital’s website features a black-and-white image of Inna accompanied in a countryside setting by her two daughters: Liana, 45, the founder of an arts production company, and Iya, 42, a human rights activist. Iya’s husband Hunyak, the co-founder of a private children’s dental group and Bili Capital’s sole shareholder since September, stands to the right of the three women with a small gap between them. The group are all smiling, with no trace of their past traumas. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Questioning the Corporation

Yves here. It’s frustrating to see a piece that presents itself as well researched get information important to its argument wrong. I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Texas Judge Rules BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard Must Face Antitrust Suit

A federal judge in Texas largely denied a request by the world’s largest asset managers to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general claiming they colluded to reduce coal output, in a case that threatens how the U.S. firms oversee trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Texas said most of the claims brought by the states can proceed, including allegations that BlackRock Inc., BlackRock Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. collectively used their stock to attempt to substantially lessen competition. Kernodle dismissed part of the lawsuit that was based on alleged violations of state law. In his Friday ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” Representatives for the firms didn’t immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. In their lawsuit, Texas and other Republican-led states claimed the asset managers colluded to pressure coal producers to reduce their production under the guise of pursuing environmental goals. The states cite the firms’ participation in carbon-reduction alliances as evidence of a “syndicate.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard hold major stakes in coal producers and profited when energy prices soared, according to the suit. More recently, the firms have pulled back from ESG in the U.S. and participation in groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Texas even removed BlackRock from its blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels. But the lawsuit, filed in November, said that formal withdrawal from Climate 100+ “does not change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation” of U.S. antitrust law. Lawyers for the three firms argued at a hearing in June that the firms did nothing to influence coal companies. “The antitrust claims in this case are unprecedented, they’re unsound and they’re unsupported,” said Gregg Costa, a lawyer representing BlackRock. “The claims just don’t add up.” Topics Lawsuits Texas Legislation
