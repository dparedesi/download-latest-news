Advances in technology have introduced revolutionary process and service upgrades for businesses in recent years. Digital tools have enabled remote work and global hiring, streamlined (and sometimes taken over) repetitive processes, improved customer service and outreach, and more. However, progress often comes with pain points, and the growing use of technology in business has raised some serious security, social, ethical and sustainability concerns. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council reflect on some of the downsides of the digital era they’ve observed, as well as why it’s essential to acknowledge and address these issues. The growing use of artificial intelligence is causing a drastic increase in data center power consumption, straining traditional infrastructure and contributing to environmental peril. However, data centers that adopt distributed energy solutions like microgrids can mitigate these issues with localized, sustainable and scalable power, ensuring they remain resilient and energy-efficient in the face of rising AI demands. - Ravi Prasher, Bloom Energy The increasing reliance on technology has notably shortened the attention span of today’s workforce. Establishing dedicated “focus time,” when we deliberately avoid using our devices, can help. Additionally, silencing phones, minimizing nonessential notifications and creating tech-free zones are effective strategies to combat distractions and boost productivity in an ever-connected world. - Batul Bohara, Amazon.com Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? In the race to leverage transformative technologies, it can be easy to lose sight of the critical role only humans can play in the outcomes they deliver. Embracing today’s powerful technologies requires managing the risks they bring, and organizations that rank empathy, critical thinking and creativity among the workforce skills they value will have an edge in meeting these challenges. - Merav Yuravlivker, Data Society Like many, I see the issues with all things related to security, but another big problem is the loss of focus on critical thinking and individual creativity. The rapid evolution of AI has created a vast number of use cases, but that shouldn’t result in the elimination of individual thought. Combining the power of AI technology with experiential human knowledge and creative thought creates more robust solutions more quickly. Foster an environment that embraces combining the power of creative thought with the power of technology. - Johanna Baum, S3 Consulting Business data doubles almost every three years due to advanced technology. The concern is where to go from here. Do we let the data explosion continue freely? There are technologies that can actively delete data and files based on document retention policies and regulations. Such services not only help us manage the volume of data being stored, but can also protect corporations from unnecessary risks in the future. - Kazuhiro Gomi, NTT Research One negative impact of technology’s growth in business is the rise of job displacement due to automation. To address this, companies can invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, empowering workers to adapt to new roles and technologies. This fosters career growth alongside tech advancements. - Tina Gada, Vanguard Group Despite investing billions in software and point solutions, organizations in complex industries (like construction and manufacturing) are plagued by disconnected systems and data. A “one size fits all” approach to technology doesn’t work; instead, look for simple, custom-fit solutions capable of solving problems in a single platform, unlocking the potential of every employee to make an impact. - Ed Jennings, Quickbase The breadth of software modern workers need to get their jobs done and the siloed nature of teams makes IT sprawl a very real problem, contributing to sunken costs and security risks. One way to mitigate this is to look for and choose solutions within your existing business platform. This approach can help organizations better manage identity security, ensuring people have only the access they need to get their work done. - John Milburn, Clear Skye One negative impact of growing tech use is the rise in electronic waste, as businesses frequently upgrade devices. To address this, companies can implement e-waste recycling programs and invest in longer-lasting, repairable technology. Promoting a circular economy reduces environmental harm while fostering a more sustainable tech life cycle. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group One negative impact of growing technology use in business is the rise of employee burnout due to constant connectivity and blurred work-life boundaries. To address this, companies can implement “digital wellness” policies, such as enforcing regular breaks, setting boundaries on after-hours communication and promoting time off to ensure employees can disconnect and recharge effectively. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The digital divide creates a stark gap between those with access to technology and those without, deepening socioeconomic inequalities. Rural areas and low-income communities often face limited access to high-speed internet, devices and digital literacy. To bridge this divide, we must invest in infrastructure, affordable access and education, ensuring equitable opportunities in a rapidly digitizing world. - Vamsi Krishna Dhakshinadhi, GrabAgile Inc. Messaging on Slack and meeting online is undeniably convenient, but I also think it’s overused. As a leader, when I can, I like to meet in person, pick up the phone or use a means of connecting that is even just one degree more “human.” We talk a lot about creating human-centered software, but we can also choose to do without the software and just be human. - Lindsey Witmer Collins, WLCM “Welcome” App Studio As businesses digitize, a key issue is data privacy. The vast amount of personal information collected increases the risk of breaches. To address this, companies should implement privacy-by-design frameworks, encrypt sensitive data and promote transparency in how data is used. This builds customer trust while ensuring compliance with evolving data protection regulations. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech One negative impact of growing technology use is the rise in algorithmic bias, where AI systems unintentionally perpetuate social biases in decision making, from hiring to credit approval. To mitigate this, businesses should implement continuous bias audits and develop explainable AI frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness, while involving diverse teams in the AI development process. - Andrii Kovalchuk, WeSoftYou Inc. A negative impact from the rise of generative AI is that people are accepting its outputs as truth, without question. It’s not always the case that GenAI’s responses are correct. Generative AI creates an answer instead of looking for one—it will sometimes create incorrect answers, and people should be aware of that. - Gonçalo Ribeiro, YData In my sector (public health), many experienced health workers are not tech-savvy. Adding technology tools can help community-based organizations sustainably grow, but for many community health workers, the transition is not easy. It’s difficult but essential to strike a balance between opportunity and sustainable social change. - Syam Adusumilli, GroundGame Health Data intolerance is growing in businesses. Have you ever tried to search an organization’s website for useful information? Good luck. The chronic lack of searchable data strangles productivity, stifles creativity and foments employee burnout. Answers aren’t as simple as “you know, AI” or “get search.” Unbreaking search requires careful, policy-based data planning, executive buy-in and deep technical talent. - James Stanger, CompTIA One downside of the growing use of technology in business is that people tend to become too dependent on it. This makes companies vulnerable when their systems fail or they’re hit with cyberattacks. To minimize risk, businesses should develop effective backup plans, diversify their tech tools to avoid reliance on a single system, and regularly train employees to handle unexpected issues. - Sergii Malomuzh, Rewump
