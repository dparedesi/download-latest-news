The Federal Reserve is expected to pause its interest-rate-cutting cycle this week, as a more stable jobs market eases divisions within the central bank. Officials believe current rates are appropriately positioned to support employment while keeping inflation in check. This decision aims to refocus on the Fed's core mandate, though it may intensify criticism from President Trump.

Title: Commercial Cleaning Services Market Report 2026 - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/26/3225816/28124/en/Commercial-Cleaning-Services-Market-Report-2026-Global-Industry-Size-Share-Trends-Opportunity-and-Forecast-2021-2031.html

January 26, 2026 11:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 26, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Commercial Cleaning Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is projected to expand from USD 225.24 Billion in 2025 to USD 336.32 Billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.91%. This sector includes professional maintenance and sanitation for non-residential environments such as healthcare institutions, corporate offices, educational facilities, and industrial sites, covering tasks ranging from standard janitorial work to specialized floor care and regulatory disinfection. Market growth is primarily fueled by rising global hygiene standards and a corporate strategy to outsource facility management for cost reduction and operational efficiency. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 34 percent of contractors anticipated significantly higher sales in 2025 compared to the previous year, signaling strong confidence in the industry. However, the market faces significant headwinds due to acute labor shortages and workforce retention issues. The industry is hampered by high turnover rates and challenges in recruiting reliable staff, often driven by wage competition and physically demanding working conditions. This instability restricts service providers' ability to scale effectively and leads to inflated recruitment and training costs. Consequently, the difficulty in maintaining a stable labor pool threatens to reduce profit margins and constrain the broader expansion of the commercial cleaning sector. Market Drivers The deployment of Automated Cleaning Technologies and Robotics has become a vital strategy to address labor shortages and the demand for consistent, high-frequency sanitation. Service providers are increasingly utilizing autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for repetitive tasks such as floor scrubbing, which allows human employees to concentrate on complex, high-touch disinfection while data analytics provide essential performance validation. Highlighting the scale of this integration, Brain Corp reported in December 2024 that its fleet of autonomous robots had cleaned over 250 billion square feet of commercial space worldwide. Simultaneously, a sharpened focus on workplace hygiene and employee wellness is driving market growth as companies implement return-to-office mandates. Facilities are adopting evidence-based hygiene protocols that go beyond visual cleanliness to minimize pathogen transmission and reassure occupants. In March 2025, Cleaning & Maintenance Management (CMM) found that 30 percent of facility managers prioritized employee health safety as a top management concern. This focus translates into financial success for providers offering health-centric solutions; for instance, ABM Industries reported a 6.2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the third quarter of 2025. Market Challenges The critical obstacle hindering the Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is a severe labor shortage coupled with the difficulty of retaining a qualified workforce. This operational bottleneck limits providers' ability to meet rising demand, forcing them to decline new contracts or restrict the scope of existing ones, which directly caps revenue potential. Additionally, the perpetual cycle of recruiting and training new personnel imposes a substantial financial burden, diverting capital that could otherwise be invested in business development and innovation. This instability is further aggravated by wage competition and the physically grueling nature of the work, which discourage long-term employment. A lack of workforce stability disrupts service continuity and quality, putting client retention and satisfaction at risk. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 40 percent of contractors in 2025 expected recruitment challenges to escalate in the coming year. This persistent deficit in the workforce erodes profit margins and stifles the overall growth of the market, preventing firms from fully capitalizing on industry momentum. Market Trends The shift toward Data-Driven and Demand-Based Cleaning Models is transforming operational workflows by replacing static schedules with dynamic, usage-based interventions. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and occupancy analytics, facility managers can dispatch cleaning teams precisely where and when they are needed, optimizing resources and preventing hygiene lapses in high-traffic areas. This approach significantly improves service precision and occupant satisfaction; for example, Tork reported in July 2025 that facility managers using the Tork Vision Cleaning system experienced a 75 percent reduction in complaints and a 68 percent improvement in operational efficiency. Concurrently, the market is being reshaped by the Expansion of Green Cleaning and Circular Economy Practices, as clients demand sustainability strategies that exceed simple chemical substitution. Service providers are increasingly adopting circular economy principles, including comprehensive waste diversion and resource-efficient operations, to align with corporate net-zero goals. Demonstrating the impact of these practices, Sodexo UK & Ireland announced in March 2025 that sites utilizing its WasteWatch data program achieved an average 45 percent reduction in food waste, highlighting the operational benefits of targeted sustainability strategies.

The company that is shepherding the broadcast television industry toward ATSC 3.0 digital broadcasting services, which owns a group of over-the-air stations that very much seeks to merge with The E.W. Scripps Co. despite that company’s insistence the unwanted overtures end, has announced when it will report its Q4 2025 earnings results. Sinclair Inc. C-Suite executives including Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter fiscal health report in an conference call scheduled for 4:30pm Eastern on February 25. Analysts, shareholders and other interested parties will have no more than 30 minutes prior to the call to glance over the results, as Sinclair intends to release them following the Closing Bell on the Nasdaq markets for that day’s trading session. The results reflecting the final three months of 2025 come at a period of relative stability for “SBGI,” the company’s Nasdaq GlobalSelect market-traded stock. Sinclair shares finished January 23’s trading session at $15.05, and that’s all but flat from one year ago. While that’s better than a steep year-over-year decline, the lack of meaningful growth could be concerning for long-term shareholders, as “SBGI” is off from a five-year high of $38.41 attributed to an early March 2021 surge in valuation. Over the next 12 months, “SBGI’ remained between $28 and $38, in March 2022 began a two-year dip. The good news? Sinclair’s stock has avoided dipping to below $10, a price nearly reached in October 2023. What are analysts forecasting for Sinclair in Q4 2025? Just one analyst reporting to Yahoo! Finance chimed in with earnings per share estimates, putting Sinclair at -$0.06 on very difficult comps tied to strong political revenue at the end of 2024. Five analysts offered revenue predictions, putting the consensus estimate at $840.25 million, down by 16.3% from the final three months of 2024. Sinclair’s lead institutional investors are Mario Gabelli-led GAMCO Investors Inc., with 9.24% attributable equity interest. That’s followed by The Vanguard Group, as of the end of Q3 2025, with some 8.09% interest in Sinclair. The third-largest institutional investor as of September 30, 2025, is Blackrock Inc., with 6.49% interest. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Greenland, Donald Trump, Technocracy and the Globalist New World Order

Will this Arctic island, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to run its own affairs domestically and remain constitutionally linked to its parent country—or will it be appropriated by the American Empire? To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. As an increasing number of strapped families throughout the world struggle to put food on the table and pay for ever-rising living expenses, the internet crowd seems more concerned with US President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing Greenland than with what’s happening to average peoples’ ability to survive. Greenland? Where’s Greenland? For those whose knowledge of geography is slim: Greenland is an island located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans—northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. At 822,700 square miles, Greenland is by far the earth’s largest island. By contrast, the second-largest, New Guinea, is only 303,381 square miles. . . These days, in light of Trump’s tantalizing statements, both the mainstream media and the alternative media are posing some interesting, though irrelevant, questions about Greenland, such as: Why do I call these questions irrelevant? As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. Besides being part of NATO, Greenland has played a crucial role in securing the northern flank of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). This role was established when Denmark and the United States signed the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, a bilateral treaty that made Greenland host to some of America’s most important and sophisticated surveillance technologies and military bases. Take, for example, Pituffik Space Base, formerly named Thule Air Base. It is a US Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland. Although the number of service members stationed at Pituffik has been greatly reduced since the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 150 troops still stationed permanently at the base. When needed, this number can be greatly increased on short notice by simply flying in thousands of US military personnel and equipment on C-17 Globemaster and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Pituffik has a 9,995-foot runway that can easily accommodate all US fighter jets and transport aircraft. . 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89s, Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1955 (United States Air Force / Public Domain) . Moreover, Pituffik is home to the 12th Space Warning Squadron, which operates phased array radar sites at known and secret locations throughout Greenland. This computer-controlled type of radar can detect and track Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and satellites. The same base also hosts Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, which is part of Space Delta’s global satellite control network. Space Delta, the primary operational unit within the US Space Force, manages specific critical global satellite missions, from military communications to missile tracking. In addition, the US military maintains numerous Over-the-Horizon radar systems at radar sites such as Pituffik and other, classified locations in Greenland. OTH radar can listen to, monitor, and track military activity thousands of kilometres away, including in Russia, on the east side of the North Pole—Greenland is on the North Pole’s west side—and beyond. Therefore, if the US government were to acquire Greenland, either through military action or diplomacy, little would change. Annexing Greenland would be a mere formality, acknowledging something that has already been a reality for more than seventy years. Greenland has always been integral to the American Empire’s global control grid.Washington insiders have long understood that Greenland’s geographic location is strategically indispensable if the US is to keep a close eye on the Arctic Northwest Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean—as well as a close eye on that region’s vast mineral, oil, and natural gas deposits. Thus, claiming that an invasion of Greenland by the US would mark the end of NATO is a moot point on at least two counts: If Greenland is already solidly in America’s sphere of influence, why is Trump talking about adding this island to “his” Empire’s acquisitions? Aside from rich and largely untapped natural resources—huge, unproven, and unexploited oil deposits (potentially 7.3 billion barrels), natural gas reserves (estimated to be anywhere from 50 trillion to 150 trillion cubic feet), and extensive mineral deposits—there is, I believe, one other main reason for this sudden attention being paid to Greenland. My hunch is that Trump is being leaned on to annex Greenland by certain highly influential individuals who contributed handsomely to his second presidential election campaign. These men—namely, Elon Musk ($292 million), Howard Lutnick ($9 million), Peter Thiel ($1.25 million), and Sam Altman ($1 million)—are now in a position to steer the President in whatever direction they desire for the purpose of fulfilling their primary goal. They are chomping at the bit to form what is known as the North American Technate, the linchpin to a full-blown and ultimately worldwide Technocracy. Musk, Lutnick, Thiel, Altman, and a number of their equally obsessive technocratic colleagues have ensconced themselves in positions of power in Trump’s current administration. They are the modern-day technocrats carrying out the dream of Howard Scott, an engineer who, with Thorstein Veblen, co-founded in 1919 the Technical Alliance, based in New York City. For those readers new to the term “Technocracy” and its history, a brief explanation is in order. The Technical Alliance was reorganized in 1932 and was moved to Columbia University, also in New York, under the name “Committee on Technocracy.” In 1933, Scott joined forces with economist M. King Hubbert—whom he had met two years earlier—to found Technocracy, Inc. Scott was the Technocracy movement’s driving force—its engineer, ideologue, innovator, intellectual—while Hubbert, a geologist, played a major supporting role as the organization’s secretary, researcher, and writer. In 1937, these two technocrats and some other lesser-known figures came up with a concise definition that explains the technocratic philosophy: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical engineering problem. Though Technocracy, Inc. disappeared (went underground?) for half-a-century, it has resurfaced in recent years. Today’s Technocracy movement is run by an equally radical group of scientists and engineers who, thanks to advancements in technology, finally have the ability to catalogue, surveil, track, trace, monitor, subjugate, and manipulate—or, to put it in one word, control—an entire population and thereby achieve specific scientific, social, geopolitical, and economic ends. Representative government, national sovereignty, the nation-state structure, politicians, capitalism, and even currencies are regarded as nonessential in a technocratic dictatorship. The 1930s vision of Technocracy’s behavioural control system is fast becoming a reality. What we are witnessing with regard to the recent events in Venezuela and the recent discussions about Greenland is a step or two closer to the completion of the North American Technate as it was envisioned and presented in 1940 by Technocracy, Inc. . The 1940 Map of the “Technate of America” . The 1940 “Technate of America” map (see above) represents one of the primary pillars that support the canopy of the multi-pillar globalist New World Order. I picture five pillars holding up a square canopy. In the center I envision the strongest and highest pillar. From its peak and to its peak—in both directions—flow all closely coordinated events, activities, and processes that the world’s powerful institutions and individuals plan together and carry out simultaneously. This pillar is in the middle (the center) because it is unique and of primary (central) importance to the whole structure. In the four corners I visualize four pillars of equal proportions. If the center pillar has primacy—which it does, and if it is preeminent—which it is, then these four pillars are of secondary stature and scope. Each of these smaller pillars props up its respective corner of the square canopy. What do all five pillars reflected in my mind’s eye represent in the real world? The central, or center, pillar, represents the 1940 Technate map. It is the highest and the strongest pillar because it is where the largest and militarily strongest empire in history, the American Empire, resides. It is here where Technocracy had its roots. And it is here where many US-based globalist think tanks—the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation, to name a few—were founded and continue to function. The central pillar is also home to the United Nations(UN) and to the agencies that operate under its umbrella: the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. [Note: Although the WHO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, it nonetheless answers to the UN, which is headquartered on Rockefeller-donated land in New York City. The same holds true for the World Economic Forum (WEF), based in Geneva but connected to the central pillar by way of its adherence to the philosophy and principles of Technocracy.] It is through the UN and its offshoot organizations that the five key objectives of the one-world technocratic convergence are being advanced. These five key objectives are: (1) digital biometric IDs, (2) thought-crime laws, (3) social credit systems, (4) carbon credits, and (5) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). When all five objectives have eventually been met, it is safe to say that the walls of a digital gulag will have been erected around each pillar—not only the central pillar of the American Empire but also the four other pillars, which we shall identify momentarily. But first, we should mention that the strongest component within—the dominant powergoverning—the American Empire is the US Department of War (DOW). Housed in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the DOW encompasses six branches of the armed services. Combined, these branches arguably have the most advanced technology, the heftiest financial resources, the widest global reach, the best logistical capabilities, and the highest degree of operational readiness on the planet. The US military’s role is not so much to defend the country as it is to maintain and protect the interests of the Wall Street money center banks. The Pentagon is also devoted to extending, beyond the US, the biosecurity medical industrial complex. For instance, it can at any point create another Operation Warp Speed with its fraudulent “vaccines.” Second, we should also mention that the State of Israel has long been the leading recipient of US foreign aid, much of it in the form of military assistance. For this reason, we can accurately claim that Israel’s government and its intelligence and military assets are intimately connected with the central pillar, the American Empire.And we can safety predict that Israel will continue to obligingly serve the US by keeping a watchful eye on the rest of the Middle East, including the region’s vast oil and gas reserves. In one of the four corners of the square we have the second pillar: the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Atop the UK pillar is Chatham House, which formulates the UK policy agenda. The agenda is then distributed to the UK government’s various arms, which in turn promote the policies to all UK citizens. The United Kingdom is an especially crucial pillar because after it pushes, tests, and implements the five objectives of its technocratic agenda in the UK, it does the same thing in its 56 Commonwealth nations, which span Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Although the UK has thus far met only one of the five objectives—thought-crime laws—the government is desperately seeking ways to execute the other four plans so it can meet all five targets. In another corner we have the pillar of the Brussels-based European Parliament. This pillar is the focal point for disseminating the technocratic plan throughout all of Europe. The European Parliament is a directly elected legislative arm of the European Union (EU), based on the Soviet system of government and without the encumbrance of democratic oversight. Thus, it effectively forms the perfect structure to extend the digital gulag’s five objectives to each member country in the EU. Holding up the New World Order canopy in another corner is China and its multi-titled technocratic leader, Xi Jinping. Since 1978, when one of Xi’s predecessors, Deng Xiaoping, became “paramount leader,” Chinese technocrats have been engineering every economic and social initiative, transforming that communist country into the world’s first Technate. Having met all five objectives—that is, having all five elements of Technocracy securely in place—China is now poised to export its technocratic know-how to client states in Africa and in Asia and to some other nations that belong to the informal, intergovernmental BRICS grouping—namely, the nations of Brazil, India, and South Africa. In the fourth and final corner of the five-pillared square we have Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Note: Russia belongs to BRICS, but it is its own pillar.] On the heels of China, all five of whose control systems are in place, Russia has implemented four of them: digital IDs, thought-crime laws, CBDCs, and carbon credits. Now the Russian Federation is attempting to rapidly deploy the remaining element of its control grid: a social credit system. Observe that all five pillars act in unison to support the all-inclusive canopy of the techno-feudalistic New World Order. If one of the pillars were to separate from the edifice, the entire structure would collapse. Therefore, the notion that we live in a “multi-polar” world order, made up of separate poles, is a fallacy. Rather, it is one world order, with each of its pillars dependent upon the others, and vice versa, with all of its pillars dependent upon each one. Put another way, no nation is an outlier or will last long if it tries to be. The world’s 193 sovereign countries (voting UN members), plus the Vatican City and the State of Palestine (non-UN members, having observer status only), plus possibly Taiwan and Kosovo (some sources list them as sovereign nations; others do not) coalesce under one pillar or another. Each and all of the five pillars are needed to support the canopy of the one-world technocratic state. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not a nation is recognized by the others, every jurisdiction on the planet is, to one degree or another, at one pace or another, building digital prison walls. However, it’s not quite enough to have pillars covered by a canopy. The entire structure must be anchored to a single, solid foundation. That foundation is a global monetary and financial system. Importantly, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a central role in that underlying system. Without the support of the BIS and its sixty-three member central banks and monetary authorities—plus the extraordinary influence of enormous investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—nothing I have described above would be possible. In other words, without the worldwide network of central banks, the entire assembly of New World Order pillars would collapse in a matter of days—and with it, all of its presumed power and its assumed authority. Isn’t it high time we resist the technocrats and abandon their dictatorial “science” of social engineering? After all, we have no need for self-inflated rulers, be they corporate or governmental, to tell us how we should—or shouldn’t—lead our lives. We do have a need to assert our sovereign rights, be they individual or national. (Denmark and Greenland, are you listening?) We do have a need to intelligently focus on finding fair-minded, peace-producing solutions to our problems. And we do have an innate, mutual desire to provide brotherly aid to and receive aid from our neighbours, be they next door or on another continent. When we are truly considerate of our neighbours, near and far, we do not infringe on their autonomy, as the tyrannical Trump is trying to do with Greenland and every other territory he covets. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

These real problems are being ignored by the fake “climate change” crowd, who hide their mercenary motives behind euphemisms like “sustainable development goals” (SDGs) and “environmental, social, and governance” benchmarks (ESGs) and florid phrases such as the “Great Reset” and “Build Back Better.” Featured image source Global Research is a reader-funded media.

Title: The Ancient Myths and Medieval Legends of the Vast Russian Forest

A man rows a canoe along a broad, glassy river. As he approaches the sandy shore, he fires two shots from his rifle. Villagers rush to greet him and his honored guest: a bear. The hunter has already opened the bear’s coat in the forest and removed its shoes and gloves. In other words, he has skinned it. Women and children kiss the animal’s pelt, stroke its staring face, and implore it not to frighten them when they pick berries in the forest. The bear is lowered into a specially prepared house adorned with its favorite tree, a young Siberian pine. Now men sing songs of Torum, the forest’s god and the bear’s father. The soul of Torum’s son must be returned home with due pomp, so that he will not trouble the people who killed him. “Out of wood,” the men sing, “a gallant new man was created.” Like bears, humans depend on the forest for their existence. The people celebrating this ritual are Khanty who live near the Agan River, in northwestern Siberia. Their ancestors arrived in the region by 500 CE, long before a Slav ever set foot there. The bear’s arrival was captured in Sons of Torum, a 1989 film by an Estonian writer and filmmaker named Lennart Meri. In 1941, at age twelve, Meri had been exiled to the Volga River region after Stalin annexed Estonia. He later became fascinated by Uralic languages like Khanty and Mansi, which are related to Hungarian and, more distantly, to Finnish and Estonian. The members of this far-­flung linguistic family shared more than vocabulary; they were united by a history of domination by Russia. Sons of Torum is an ode to survival and return. Meri became the second president of newly independent Estonia in 1992, bringing the memory of Siberia’s forests to the highest rungs of Estonia’s government. In 2006, he was buried in Tallinn’s Forest Cemetery, where Estonian luminaries rest eternally among the trees. The Khanty bear ceremony survived encounters first with imperial Russian missionaries and colonizers, then with forced Soviet modernization, collectivization, and executions. Some of the earliest information about Khanty religious traditions comes from Russian priests who sent their reports to the archbishop of Siberia to alert him to the problem of continued paganism. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, ethnographers became fascinated by the bear ceremony. Finnish and Hungarian visitors were particularly attracted by the linguistic link to their own languages. It was mind-­boggling to think that one branch of the same population had ended up in the baroque palaces of Budapest while another had remained hunter-­fisher-­gatherers in the remote northern forests. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. The strange kinship had a whiff of alternative history: What would have happened if Hungarians had never adopted agriculture, never become owners of grand estates, never built cities? Well into the twentieth century, the Khanty relied for their survival on their reindeer herds and on the gifts of the forest and rivers: berries and pine nuts, dried and smoked fish, frozen meat, dried birds. Their forest lifeway still resembled societies that existed across northern Eurasia for millennia. Once upon a time, the people living in this area were at the vanguard of human development. A few hundred kilometers northwest of the river where Meri filmed, a sandy elevated spit overlooks the vast expanse of the West Siberian plain. Whorls of Siberian pine, spruce, and larch cede to brown, squelching swamp. This stretch of forest is the last before the beginning of Arctic tundra to the north. It is traced with wide, slow rivers, still the principal routes of transport for the Khanty and other Indigenous people—­by boat in summer, and in winter, along the ice. White moss, food for reindeer, foams on the ground beneath the trees. This remote expanse of taiga hardly seems like a cradle of human innovation. Today, it sits squarely in the middle of nowhere. Yet it contains one of the oldest-­known fortified settlements in the world. The Amnya site, named for the nearby river of that name, has astonished the archaeology world and helped overturn assumptions about how societies progress over time, changing from peaceful hunter-­gatherer communities to agrarian societies characterized by private property, social inequality, and warfare. Radiocarbon dating published in 2023 shows that the fortifications were built eight thousand years ago—­almost five thousand years earlier than researchers had thought such settlements were first established in the region, and many centuries before the appearance of similar forts in Europe. The tiny, wooded citadel is the northernmost Stone Age stronghold anywhere in Eurasia. It survived in part because the area’s forest, too cold and swampy for agriculture, has never been plowed. Up to the present day, the Indigenous people living nearby have refrained from building over the visible house pits. According to their traditional cosmology, digging is dangerous, because it risks disturbing the spirits of the lower world. This fortified settlement, and numerous similar, more recent promontory forts in the Ob River region, offer a tantalizing riddle for archaeologists. Why did Neolithic people need forts in the first place? What were these fortifications meant to protect, at a time long before trade? And how did Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers manage to construct this monumental architecture so deep in the northern forest, in a place that even today is seventeen hours by car from the nearest major Russian city? There is clearly something exceptional about the Ob River basin. The area shows evidence of continuous habitation since the Neolithic period. A former riverbed nearby, abandoned by the larger river-­course and reduced to a dead-­end lake, provides one clue. This area is known even today for its abundant fish. It is home to pike, perch, and whitefish, as well as exotic, fatty northern fish of the salmonid family: tender, silvery muksun, white-­fleshed nelma, and the hucho taimen, which makes for delectable “taiga sushi,” as Henny Piezonka, a German archaeologist studying the Amnya site, described it. With its blue-­green head and luminous, sunset-­colored tail, the taimen is so big that Chinese and Mongolian legends render it as a kind of sea monster. The so-­called river wolf or river tiger is known to prey on rats, ducks, and muskrats, though it usually hunts other fish. It can grow to be up to six feet long and one hundred pounds, and it can live for fifty-­five years. The taimen makes the Amnya site look modern: It has existed for fifty million years. Archaeologists suspect that the Amnya settlement was built to store and protect the bounty caught in this relict lake, which is a perfect place to fish using a weir, an underwater fence. The Khanty and Selkup, another Indigenous group in the area, still fish using weirs—­as Piezonka put it, “technology perfected eight thousand years ago.” Sons of Torum shows how Khanty men strip pine roots with their knives and teeth, smoothing them until they are supple as leather. The roots are used to bind wooden laths, forming a screen to trap fish in a lake after they swim in during the spring. In the autumn, when it becomes cold enough to preserve them, the fish can be pulled out of the water without the aid of lines or nets. Such piscine bounty demanded new ways of living. A weir cannot be abandoned for a season. It requires year-­round maintenance, as well as protection from enemies and wild animals such as bears. A weir could make the difference between a well-­fed winter and death by starvation. This explains why nomadic or seminomadic hunter-­gatherers chose to build a fortress on the riverbank and commit to settling down. The strong but flexible roots of the Siberian pine, woven into a weir, bound them to a single place. The Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers lived relatively well. Like the Khanty as late as the twentieth century, they hunted forest animals and ate preserved fish in winter; in spring, they turned to migratory birds arriving from the south; in autumn, they caught fish and elk migrating from the other side of the Ural Mountains. The beginning of the Neolithic period was the moment when people began to use ceramic vessels as well as wooden ones, and this area near the Amnya is the first place in the region where pottery has been found. Before ceramics, containers were made of birch bark, which can be used for baking but cannot be held over an open flame. Clay pottery made it possible to simmer, a process essential to making fish oil or fish glue, and to store food safely over long periods. (The local Indigenous people still make fish glue from pike bones.) The taiga’s long stretches of subzero weather, meanwhile, allowed the Neolithic people to freeze meat and oils. The accumulation of precious food opened new possibilities for social organization. Inequality resulted, as did property rights and collective projects such as the construction of the fort. And there was war. Fish oil and fish meal, easy to store and transport but requiring much labor in its acquisition and preparation, was an appealing target for raiders. The Amnya complex shows evidence of the first stone arrowheads in the region, contemporaneous with the emergence of fortified settlements. Archaeologists suggest that they were used for war rather than hunting. This warfare may have been a product not only of competition for existing resources but also of prehistoric climate change. Around 6200–­6050 BCE, the climate cooled, causing population movements and prompting hunter-­gatherers around northern Eurasia to mark their territory in novel ways; hunter-­gatherers in Russian Karelia, at the border of present-­day Finland, began to use formal cemeteries. Away from their fortified home, the taiga dwellers built small structures and made offerings, depositing stone arrowheads and pottery decorated with the sculpted heads of birds and animals. The worshippers set the structures alight and then heaped them with soil, pouring out vivid red ochre to close the ceremony. As the ritual was repeated, red hills grew; they contain animal bones, antlers, and human skulls. The hills prefigure the burial mounds of the Scythian warrior-­nomads of Siberia as well as the festive bonfires of the pagan Slavs—­a tradition that continues even today. The Amnya site’s rustling, wet expanse of trees and swamp has yielded a new understanding of human progress. The establishment of agriculture is still widely considered to be an essential step on the road to social “complexity”: accumulation, private property, social hierarchies, economic inequality, military conquest. The Neolithic Amnya fort shows that warfare and surplus economies can be sustained for millennia without agriculture, and that hunter-­fisher-gatherers, who have often been imagined as primitive and peaceful, may have been more warlike and more sophisticated than scientific tradition had assumed. Even in the 2020s, the Siberian forest murmurs with startling secrets. It is a treasure chest, a hiding place, a fortress. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. In the prehistoric period, the taiga’s fish determined the course of human civilization. During the medieval era, it was the taiga’s furs that would reshape Eurasian economies and societies. During that period, fortifications around the Ob River served as safe storage points for the precious sable pelts collected by Indigenous hunters—­Khanty, Mansi, Selkup, and Nenets—­who sold them to traders or surrendered them as tribute. The mysterious northern forests of Siberia and northern Russia were renowned throughout medieval Eurasia as the source of furs that were traded as far as China, Italy, and North Africa, coveted by monarchs and aristocrats, traders and warlords. Archaeologists have found Persian Sassanid silver, ornate Byzantine vessels, and Chinese coins at forts in the Ob River basin, which was a spur of the Silk Road. Fur first became fashionable in the Islamic world. In the tenth century, Arab rulers and European kings wore dresses made of black and red fox fur. The very best fur, the most gorgeous pelts in the purest tints, came from northern European Russia and from northwestern Siberia, which became known to the Islamic world as “the land of darkness.” By the eleventh century, Europe’s monarchs, lords and ladies were draping themselves in sable, ermine, and “vair,” squirrel fur sewn into heraldic patterns. Later, they trimmed their brightly colored woolen clothes in gray and white “minever,” another name for squirrel. The fashion caught on among merchants and craftsmen. In 1327 England restricted fur-­wearing to royalty and people of “high birth with incomes over 100 pounds per annum.” The effort failed, and upwardly mobile English people continued to deck their ambition in animal pelts. As western Europe hacked down its forests to make way for agriculture, its taste for fur only grew. The most desirable gray-­blue and white winter squirrel pelts, favorites of Henry III and Edward I of England, came from Scandinavia and northern Russia. The Siberian forests, still nearly untouched, were a treasure trove. Fur could be exchanged for silver, fine woolen textiles, salt, and other luxury goods. It could even be a tool of diplomacy, sent to foreign rulers as a gesture of goodwill. For centuries, furs were by far the most valuable commodity coming from the dark northern lands, and one of the most valuable luxury goods circulating in Eurasia. The fur trading network reached as far as Spain, North Africa, China, and India. Once small groups of hunter-­gatherers had fought over fish meal in the taiga; now states and armies across Eurasia competed for fur. Controlling the fur trade depended on controlling the people who knew best how to trap the elusive sable, ermine, squirrel, and other creatures. But who were these expert hunters? Thanks to the fur trade, the peoples of the northern Eurasian forests were vaguely known as far away as Central Asia and China. The first accounts of the people dwelling on the southern edges of Siberia are from Chinese chronicles rather than Russian ones. The word taiga (the stress comes on the final “a”), synonymous with Siberia’s forests today, is not a Russian word but a Turkic name that comes from these earlier encounters with the forest peoples. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. The forest and its inhabitants sparked the imagination of the era’s travel writers, who did not restrain their fancy. The twelfth-century Muslim traveler Abū Hāmid described one of the Islamic world’s first fur sources: “On the sea is an area of darkness, known under the name Iura.” The people of Iura (a name for the Indigenous people of western Siberia) have no war and no animals for transportation, “only huge trees and forests in which there is a lot of honey, and they have a lot of sables.” The forest provides for all their needs. In the summer the sun does not set for forty days, and in the winter the night lasts for forty days—­a nightmare for Muslims, whose religious practices depend on more regular cycles. Most striking is Abū Hāmid’s description of Iura’s trade: The merchants say that the land of darkness is not far from them and that the people of Iura go to this land of darkness and enter it with torches and find there a large tree not unlike a large village, and in it is a large animal, which, they say, is a bird. They bring goods with them, and each merchant puts his property down in a separate place, makes his sign on it and goes away. Then after a while they return and find goods that are needed in their country. And each man finds some of those things near his own goods; if he agrees, then he takes them; if not, he gathers his own things and leaves the others and no exchange takes place. And they do not know from whom they are buying these goods. The single large tree, with its single bird inhabitant, represents the huge, frightening treasure chest of the taiga. It yields its riches only to the initiated, who trade their furs through a string of mysterious middlemen. The process is opaque enough to seem mythical. The Eastern Slavs, too, imagined the fur-­collecting peoples of the north as creatures from a fairytale. In the Primary Chronicle of 1096, the writer recounts a story told to him by a certain Giuriata Rogovich of Novgorod. According to Rogovich, the Iugra (an alternate version of “Iura”), Indigenous people of northwestern Siberia, described mountains that reached from the heavens to the sea. From the mountains, the Iugra said, could be heard the sound of voices, people cutting their way out of the rock. Though their language was incomprehensible, it was somehow evident that the people in the mountain were asking for more iron. In exchange, they would trade furs to the Iugra. But most of the year, the route to these mysterious mountain dwellers was impassable thanks to forest, snow, and precipices. Beneath its fabulously improbable surface, this medieval game of telephone likely contains several kernels of truth. Travelers of the period exaggerated all their tales of unfamiliar peoples. But by telling this story, the Iugra may have been discouraging the Slavs from establishing direct contact with their trading partners, or from attempting to extract the forest’s riches themselves. The Iugra had good reason to protect their status as middlemen, which brought profit and safety. For several centuries, they would succeed in preserving their land of darkness from the incursions of Russian colonizers. The city-­state of Novgorod was an early seat of Slavic power, existing from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries. At its peak, it stretched from the Baltics to the Urals. Its capital city was built with the wood of the surrounding forests. Oak, lime, and elm were used for the most valuable structures; the more abundant pine, spruce, and birch served for everything else. Novgorod was a forest transmuted into a society, a kingdom of woodworking. It grew rich from its forests, where precious furs were so abundant that medieval visitors to Novgorod reported silky-­coated animals falling from the sky. The Novgorodians were the first Slavic people to conquer the northern forest west of the Urals. Beginning in the eleventh century, they forced the Komi, natives of northeastern European Russia who are distantly related to the Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians, to bring them fur tribute. Now the native hunters were not traders exchanging pelts for weapons, metals, and other goods, as in the fanciful tales about the Iura/Iugra, but subjects paying tax to Slavic lords. A fifteenth-­century account of an exploratory trip into Siberia by Novgorodian merchants in search of fur, “On unknown men in the eastern land,” describes the peoples encountered along the way. These sketches are outlandish and clearly fanciful, drawing on a long-­standing tradition of European myths about semihuman tribes. The first group are described as cannibals who serve their own children as a welcome meal for the visiting merchants. But other descriptions can be read as a kind of magical ethnography. One group lives in the sea for a month every year as its people shed their old skins and grow new ones—­perhaps a reference to the practice of wearing fish leather, common among northern peoples, and to seasonal migration. Another tribe is mouthless. Its mute members eat by putting food under their caps and chewing with their shoulders—­a highly embroidered version of a people who speak a language unintelligible to the merchants or their interpreters. Another group dies for two months every winter, then returns to life. This is simply hibernation: a merging of humans with bears. The historian Janet Martin has pointed out that this story was not pure invention: The locations of the peoples described and the indication of who had sable were accurate. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. __________________________________ Excerpt from The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empires.
