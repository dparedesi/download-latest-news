Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The Fashion Group International held its 40th annual gala at The Plaza hotel. Senior Editor With all of the slick runway shows, big-name designers and highly polished boutiques, fashion can appear to be all glamour, but working in the industry takes fortitude — and time. That was a recurring message from several of the award winners at the Fashion Group International‘s “Night of Stars” at The Plaza hotel Tuesday night. It was also suitable considering that the event was marking a 40-year anniversary — no small feat given New York City’s busy fall social calendar. Even when welcoming guests, Zac Posen and Coco Rocha, (who were the evening’s honorary chairs with Richard Dickson), touched upon the tests of time in their friendship and careers. Posen joked that he had become a FGI “Rising Star” award winner in 1800. And Rocha showed off his current agility — an evening gown made of Gap icon denim jackets. Posen, Gap Inc.’s newly installed executive vice president and creative director, quickly turned the spotlight onto the honorees, saying, “Tonight we are here to celebrate you. You have elevated our craft to new heights. You are the true stars tonight, and we applaud your remarkable contributions.” Related Articles From The Newsroom Jane Lauder Shares a Journey of Innovation and Legacy Beauty Features Tackling Beauty's Travel-retail Conundrum FGI’s leader Maryanne Grisz acknowledged how integral the late Margaret Hayes and Diane Clehane were to creating the annual gala. Recalling how FGI was founded “by women and for women in 1930,” Grisz hinted at the next generation, wearing a gown designed by Cyril Verdavainne, a 2024 “Rising Star” winner. The organization now spans 26 regions as “a grassroots organization that can make change happen.” In addition to plans to make “Night of Stars” a global event, the group has launched a Thought Leaders Platinum Membership. You May Also Like Honoring Fern Mallis with the Founders award, MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle spoke of how fashion is “a really, really hard business behind-the scenes. Everyone in this room knows it. It is an industry where the margins are so small. One year you are the hottest, most fabulous, celebrated person and the next season you’re forgotten,” she said. Beyond being able to spot a trend and new talent, Ruhle praised Mallis for her realness and understanding of human nature, talent, hard work, drive and “what real mentorship is.” Hundreds of guests seemed to agree, giving Mallis, the architect behind New York Fashion Week and creator of “Fashion Icons” talks, the only standing ovation of the night. “I love being part of this extraordinary industry, which can be tough, challenging and sometimes even appreciative, but ultimately warm, generous, unpredictable and always creative,” Mallis said. “Remember my advice to succeed is, ‘Be nice and vote.’” Estée Lauder’s Catherine Bomboy Dougherty was saluted for championing education and literacy with poet Amanda Gorman and for helping to raise more than $50 million with MAC Viva Glam and Rihanna to benefit HIV and AIDS patients. The “Beauty” award winner, said, “Beauty is about more than appearances. It’s about empowerment, confidence, self-expression. I am so fortunate to work alongside people, who understand the power of beauty and helping others to feel seen and valued.” During the Night of Stars program, former “Night of Stars” winners like Elie Tahari and Dennis Basso took to the stage separately to toast FGI’s milestone and the organization. Presenting the “Vanguard” award to her business partner LaQuan Smith, Jacqueline Cooper recalled how they met “in a very organic, beautiful way — the club of New York City.” She said, “It’s crazy how he has been able to accomplish everything that he set out to do, but also be very true to himself, organic and still have this love of New York City and vibrancy that we don’t really see too often nowadays.” Smith said, “From a young boy growing up in Queens, N.Y., designing dresses in my grandmother’s basement, I have certainly come a long way.” Just as his grandparents “never wavered in their support” of him, Smith acknowledged Cooper’s support and shared the award with her. “Jackie is everything — my business partner, manager, wife, best friend. I’ve never had anyone who has fought so hard for me. We really do fight like cats and dogs — it’s really bad sometimes. But she is always there for me and saying, ‘LaQuan, today is a new day’ — no matter how hard it gets.” The 2024 “Humanitarian” award winner, Harry Kargman, Kargo’s founder and chief executive officer, was unable to attend the gala, due to the recent loss of his father-in-law Arie Kopelman, former president and chief operating officer of Chanel Inc. Heidi and Marc D’Amelio, and one of their influencer daughters Dixie, accepted the Media award on behalf of their social media-centric family, which has a reach of 400 million. (Their daughter Charli is busy preparing for her Broadway debut in “& Juliet.”) The New York City-born Marc D’Amelio clued in many to the fact that he had started his own clothing brand 20 years ago and that his great grandfather had been a dress designer in New York. “My wife came here from Louisiana and fashion brought us together. I remember being in Paris watching Dixie do a fashion shoot for Valentino, and Charli’s doing things for Prada,” he said. “I think about how fashion has impacted our lives and [the lives of] so many families in this audience. It’s really incredible what FGI is doing with all of the opportunities that’s it going to give to so many people to experience what my family has experienced.” Picking up the “Fashion Visionary” award, Reed Krakoff spoke of the significance of being celebrated by one’s peers, many of whom he’s grown up with in the industry in the past 30 years. “People like Fern, who was one of my early supporters. I think she was my only supporter at one point,” Krakoff quipped. “I actually was rejected by the CFDA once. Fern was instrumental in getting me in.” Highlighting his career stops at Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Coach, Tiffany & Co., and now John Hardy, Krakoff mentioned how along the way there were moments where someone saw something in him that he didn’t see. He singled out Hilfiger for tapping him as creative director, when that role was just emerging. He also mentioned how he joined Coach, despite having never designed a handbag, a fact that others were unaware of — but he learned. “This industry is so much more than a job. I’ve been so fortunate to have so many incredible relationships, experiences, travel, and ups and downs. As all of the creative people who came up here have mentioned, fashion is a tough business. But the relationships and the people are really what make it what it is,” he said. Accepting the “Fashion Heritage” award from the actress Kate Hudson, Max Mara’s Maria Giulia Prezioso Maramotti recalled how as a four-year-old she visited her grandfather at work drawing. “I still feel the same passion and excitement today that I felt when I was four years old. This is why, for us, Max Mara, is much more than a fashion house. It is our family legacy, a labor of love and it represents our values of the vision of my grandfather, when he founded the company in 1951.” Emphasizing how that continues, Maramotti said, “My family and I are committed to continuing our mission of creating beautiful, meaningful fashion that resonates across time, because after all, that is what heritage is about — the ability to transfer beauty and values across generations.” As The Plaza’s ballroom emptied out and some guests spoke of nightcaps, the D’Amelios gamely posed for selfies with attendees — they have “never refused a photo — ever,” according to Marc D’Amelio. That fan base inevitably could bode well for his kin’s next venture. With D’Amelio Footwear up-and-running, the plan is to do some licensing deals for accessories and other categories. One thing that most designers can’t do is play the piano with their toes, as Dixie D’Amelio can and occasionally still does. “Just to make sure that I still can — I’ve got a few songs,” she said, before being reeled into another selfie.

Title: Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) insiders seem bullish, own 55% and have been buying more recently

Dicker Data's significant insider ownership suggests inherent interests in company's expansion The top 2 shareholders own 54% of the company Insiders have been buying lately Every investor in Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 55% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). It's interesting to note that insiders have been buying shares recently. This could signal that stock prices could go up and insiders are here for it. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Dicker Data. See our latest analysis for Dicker Data Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Dicker Data does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Dicker Data's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Dicker Data is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Fiona Brown, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 31%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. David Dicker is the second largest shareholder owning 23% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 1.9% of the company stock. Interestingly, the second-largest shareholder, David Dicker is also Chief Executive Officer, again, pointing towards strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders. A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 54% stake. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. It seems that insiders own more than half the Dicker Data Limited stock. This gives them a lot of power. Given it has a market cap of AU$1.7b, that means insiders have a whopping AU$943m worth of shares in their own names. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to discover if they have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Dicker Data is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about... If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts. NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Title: NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 54% of the company

Significantly high institutional ownership implies NN Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NN Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for NN Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NN Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NN Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NN Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 6.6%. Norges Bank Investment Management is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that NN Group N.V. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €3.2m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. With a 46% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NN Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for NN Group you should be aware of. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future. NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Title: While institutions own 38% of FirstRand Limited (JSE:FSR), retail investors are its largest shareholders with 47% ownership

FirstRand's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company Institutions own 38% of FirstRand Every investor in FirstRand Limited (JSE:FSR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 47% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Meanwhile, institutions make up 38% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of FirstRand. View our latest analysis for FirstRand Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that FirstRand does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at FirstRand's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. FirstRand is not owned by hedge funds. Public Investment Corporation Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Bee Partners, LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 4.9% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.7% of the company stock. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of FirstRand Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own R1.6b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in FirstRand. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that FirstRand is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.
