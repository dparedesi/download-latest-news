Title: 'Perennial Dusk -Kinsenka-' Visual Novel by Frontwing and Bushiroad Has Been Released on Steam
URL: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2025-05-29/perennial-dusk-kinsenka-visual-novel-by-frontwing-and-bushiroad-has-been-released-on-steam/.224915

TOKYO - May, 2025 - Tokyo-based video game developers and publishers Frontwing and Bushiroad have released the visual novel “Perennial Dusk -Kinsenka-” on Steam. The game is available with Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese text options, retailing at $29.99. “Perennial Dusk -Kinsenka-” is a kinetic novel about a group of exorcists-in-training who face horrific beings known as Maledicts, set in a strange world where the living and the dead mingle. Told through the perspective of multiple narrators, it explores how the human heart endures relentless violence and limitless cruelty. The game features well-known anime voice actresses including Manaka Iwami (Akane, “Oshi no Ko”)—who voices both Matsuri and her alter-ego Nobody as two separate heroine characters in the game—and Yumiri Hanamori (Yuka, “Blue Period”; Hanasaka, “Kaguya-sama: Love is War”)—who voices male protagonist Sai. Sample voice clips of all characters who have already been revealed are available on the game's official website. The story is written by Yukito Urushibara, a well-established writer for popular visual novels such as “Irotoridori no Sekai” and “Sakura, Moyu. -as the Night's, Reincarnation-.” The illustrations are done primarily by Saine, who also created the character designs for most of the game's characters, and Akio Watanabe of “Monogatari” series fame. The theme song, “Anata no Kioku no Naka de,” (“Inside Your Memories”) is sung by Mao Uesugi, one of the vocalists of internationally renowned musical group fripSide. The game's opening video can be viewed on its Steam store page and the Frontwing YouTube channel. An Expansion Patch is also available specifically for the Steam version of the game. The game with the Expansion Patch does not contain explicit sexual imagery, but features depictions of extreme violence, references to abuse and other mature themes that call for viewer discretion. STORY Tachibana Sai lives only to protect his sister from harm, often resorting to lethal means to do so. Weary of the persistent numbness in his heart, he welcomes the prospect of death... That is, until a fateful meeting with Matsuri fills him with a searing pain—a feeling he can only interpret as love. Upon Sai joining their ranks as the newest resident, the ill-assorted group of exorcists-in-training and their reckless mentor find a home together in an old apartment building. A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body. Bathed in the light of an everlasting sunset, they begin to experience contentment for the first time in their miserable lives. Yet, with their occupation leading to increasingly vicious foes, they are doomed to violent deaths. With Sai now in their midst, only time will tell whether they encounter the hearts they never knew or succumb to the horrors of the dusk.
