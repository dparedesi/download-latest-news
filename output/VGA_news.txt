December 23, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. TORONTO, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. today announced the final annual capital gains distributions for the Vanguard ETFs listed below for the 2025 tax year. This is an update to the estimated annual capital gains distributions announced on November 18, 2025 and December 17, 2025. These amounts are for the year-end capital gains distributions only, which will be re-invested and the resulting units immediately consolidated, so that the number of units held by each investor will not change. The annual capital gains distributions do not include the ongoing monthly, quarterly or annual cash distribution amounts, which are reported in a separate press release. The ex-dividend date for the 2025 annual distributions for these ETFs is December 23, 2025. The record date for the 2025 annual distributions will be December 23, 2025 and payable on January 2, 2026. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested capital gains distributions for 2025, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.) in early-2026. *as of December 22, 2025 To learn more about the Cboe Canada Exchange-listed Vanguard ETFs, please visit www.vanguard.ca Forward-looking information This notice contains forward-looking statements with respect to the 2025 year-end capital gains distributions for the Vanguard ETFs.
