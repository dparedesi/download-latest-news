The word out this morning is Pandemic Horde is giving up on whatever plans they may have had and are shutting down, with the remaining central corporations in the alliance, Blessed Beans, Horde Vanguard, Horde Armada, and Coolbeans, joining The Initiative. The announcement on Discord, as posted on Reddit. The closure announcement For those unable to read the tiny text, this is a transcription of the announcement: Johnny Trousersnake – 20:05 @everyone Update Hello friends. Last month we announced a plan to leave coalitions behind and work towards being an independent entity. They say plans never survive contact with the enemy, and as you know, ours didn’t survive the ping. There has been a lot of uncertainty since then – and people want a long-term home, and more space to live and play in. An extended stay in purgatory while attempting a rebuild and navigating today’s political landscape is something we no longer feel is feasible, nor would it be in our players’ best interests. With that in mind, we will be shuttering Pandemic Horde and closing the Alliance. We have been in contact with your CEOs over the past week to discuss this. Several Corporations, including the core of Bless, Armada, Cool Beans and VG will be joining INIT, with others following their own paths. I want to re-assure everyone that regardless of destination, standings and docking access will be maintained for all Corporations during this transition. This will not be a repeat of last month. We’d also like to address asset safety costs which has been a constant pain point for everyone. In just a moment, we’re going to assign every member of every ESI corp that stuck with us over the past month, enough Gobloons to withdraw the most expensive ship from each Dronelands doctrine from asset safety. We hope this helps out. Asset Safety Gobloons were assigned to your ‘main’ on Square. If you do not see them, please double check all of your characters. If you think you may have been missed, please contact one of these names on Discord and specify your character name: [names omitted] Gobloons are the SRP currency used by Pandemic Horde. Participation in operations earns them and you can cash them in for ISK for ship loss reimbursement. Or that is my understanding of the mechanism. So they will be issuing Gabloons to members to convert to ISK to help them get their most expensive hull out of asset safety. Given that asset safety jumped from around 2.5 trillion ISK every month to 19.5 trillion ISK in November, according to the November MER, those Gabloons are probably not going to stretch very far. Back on October 11th of this year Pandemic Horde had 48K capsuleers in its ranks and held 414 systems, making in the second largest alliance in null sec. Top 10 Sov Holding Alliances by Member Count – Oct 11 Then came the collapse, the botched evacuation from the Drone regions, the betrayal of long time allies, and the lack of any real plan for the future, during which two thirds of its members left or were kicked from the alliance. Pandemic Horde Collapse charts – Dec 11, 2025 Even then, sitting with around 16K members, it could have been a power in null sec. But that requires competent and motivated leadership, something the alliance has lacked for some time now. 16K well led pilots can carve out space to live in null sec. 16K capsuleers without leadership are just an aimless mob that will accomplish nothing. So it goes. The Initiative had previously accepted some corporations from Pandemic Horde during the collapse, and offered some temporary space Cloud Ring to what remained of the alliance in order to figure out what to do next. That wasn’t supposed to be a permanent situation, but with a leaderless alliance sleeping on your couch with no hope of survival on its own at this point, I suppose the answer was to either drive them out with a stick or take in the refugees on a more permanent basis. It isn’t often you see an alliance collapse. With even a semblance of a core and some leadership, alliances in much worse positions have come back. TEST has been driven out of its space a few times now and is still lurking… safely under the protective wing of Fraternity to be sure, but they are still around. This move will bulk up The Initiative by nearly 4K more pilots. The remaining 12K pilots left in the alliance… which includes the spy ridden Pandemic Horde Inc and its 8K members, half of what remained of the alliance… will need to figure out their own path. Long time members might be accepted into the four corporations that are merging into The Initiative. And The Initiative may take some additional corps. They already have 24, what difference would a few more make at this point? I listened to some of the town hall they had for the announcement. The message itself was pretty terse, limited pretty much to what was in the written announcement. Most of the 45 minutes was Q&A about what to do next. I am sure it was pretty dejecting for line members, one more indignity on top of almost two months of such failings. I have been covering my own interaction with events in a series of posts if you want some more back story. What happens next remains to be seen. The closure plan is set to be completed almost immediately according to the town hall. At least the whole thing will be commemorated in an special item that you can find as part of the Winter Nexus event. Gone but never forgotten now… Meanwhile, while The Initiative has always been a strong group, part of their strength has been their agility. They are now in the same weight class as their current opponent, Fraternity. Whether the additional pilots help them in their campaign or if their integration into the organization becomes a burden remains to be seen. Related: Huh.. I guess we won. I’m gonna go ahead and still say “we” despite not having played the game in 6 years. LikeLike Good riddance to unironic trash. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Emerging Trends in the Nematicides Market: Bio-Based Solutions Set to Transform Crop Yields by 2030

December 10, 2025 04:10 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Nematicides Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Global Nematicides Market, valued at USD 1.87 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.51% to reach USD 3.05 Billion by 2030. Nematicides are chemical or biological agents developed to control plant-parasitic nematodes that severely damage crops by attacking root systems. Market growth is strongly driven by the need to reduce crop losses and increase food security as global demand rises. Key Market Drivers: The persistent global challenge of declining arable land: Declining arable land worldwide significantly increases reliance on nematicides to maximize productivity from existing farmland. With global population growth and limited land resources, protecting yields becomes essential. FAOSTAT Analytical Brief 107 reported in June 2025 that cropland per capita decreased by about 20%, from 0.24 to 0.19 hectares between 2001 and 2023, intensifying the need for nematicides to prevent nematode-related yield losses. Simultaneously, rising consumer demand for organic and sustainably produced food is reshaping the market, accelerating the shift toward bio-based nematicides. According to IFOAM and FiBL's 2025 yearbook, global organic farmland grew by 2.5 million hectares in 2023, reaching nearly 99 million hectares. This growth supports the adoption of biological nematicides. The broader pesticide and agricultural chemicals market, including nematicides, is projected to grow from USD 102.9 billion in 2023 to USD 169.8 billion by 2028, as reported by Infosys in its 2024 Agri-chem Industry Outlook. Key Market Challenges: Stringent regulatory frameworks and increasing environmental concerns regarding the residual effects of certain synthetic nematicides: Strict regulations and rising environmental concerns surrounding synthetic nematicides significantly hinder market growth. Rigorous testing, lengthy approval processes, and compliance requirements increase development costs and extend timelines, reducing incentives to invest in new chemical active ingredients. According to CropLife Australia (2024), developing a new crop protection chemical now exceeds USD 300 million and typically requires more than 12 years due to extensive environmental and toxicology data requirements. Regulatory withdrawals also limit farmers' access to critical active ingredients. CropLife Africa Middle East (2023) reported that maize pest control tools could face a 75% reduction and coffee pest tools a 58% reduction in Kenya due to EU-driven restrictions. These challenges constrain product portfolios and restrict overall market growth. Key Market Trends: The integration of precision agriculture technologies into nematicide application: Precision agriculture is increasingly shaping nematicide use by enabling more efficient, targeted application through GPS-guided systems, remote sensing, and variable-rate technologies. These tools reduce waste, improve application accuracy, and enhance crop health while minimizing environmental impact. According to the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (January 2025), Variable Rate Technology adoption in the U.S. increased by 69% across major commodity crops, reflecting the growing reliance on data-driven input management. Strategic collaborations across agrochemical companies, biotech firms, and research institutions are also accelerating innovation in advanced nematicide solutions, particularly biological products. For example, Bayer and Kimitec's June 2025 launch of Ambition Complete Gen2 and Ambition Secure Gen2 demonstrates how alliances expedite the development of next-generation biological nematicides and broaden market offerings.
