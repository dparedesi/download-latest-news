India’s second-biggest information technology services company has begun work much in advance to expand its largest contract worth more than $3 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys Ltd wants an early extension of the eight-year contract signed in December 2020 with German automobile major Daimler, the people added, with a new revenue arm added that brings in artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the deal. The Daimler project, dubbed ‘twice as fast program’ inside Infosys, has the company offering solutions in six areas—network, security, SAP basis, data centre, workplace, and operations—and assures it of average annual revenue of $400 million, according to the two people cited earlier. The data centre business brings in $160 million revenue annually, while the remaining software and hardware components bring in the balance $240 million.

The executive added that the discussions between Daimler and Infosys are at an early stage, and both companies remain hopeful of closing the contract by next year.

For Infosys, the Daimler deal has helped business from manufacturing companies more than double in the past four years, from $1.3 billion revenue in the year ended March 2020 to $2.8 billion last year. During this time, Infosys grew 37% to end the fiscal year with $18.6 billion in revenue. “The early renewal indicates that emphasis is going to be on making additional investments likely in AI," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Dallas-based IT research firm Everest Group, adding that other IT services companies might also look to rework their mega deals to have an AI aspect. An early renewal to the company’s largest deal comes when mega deals, valued at over $1 billion, are few in number for the country’s largest software services companies.
