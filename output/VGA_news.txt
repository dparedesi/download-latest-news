Polyamines (PAs), including spermidine, spermine and their precursor, putrescine, are ubiquitous molecules that are vital for a variety of physiological processes. Recently, PAs gained research attention because of their roles in promoting longevity and preventing age-related diseases. Circulating and tissue levels of PAs appear to decline with age, while higher intake of PAs in humans is correlated with better health during aging. Many foods, including plants and offal (organ meats), are good sources of dietary PAs, but are consumed much less in regions with prevailing Western diets. Elevating the circulating levels of PAs through dietary supplementation with PA-rich plant extracts or foods, on the other hand, has proven to be challenging, most likely due to their low bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of nutritional supplements derived from bovine glandular tissues and/or plant material in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine, spermine and putrescine in adult rats. We detected appreciable amounts of PAs in the following materials: 1) spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), containing wheat germ, 2) a cytosolic fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Cytosolic Fraction – TCF) and 3) a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Nuclear Fraction – TNF). We showed that all three PA-containing supplements also contain liposomes, with TNF displaying the largest amounts of liposomal PAs, as well as RNAs, among the tested supplements. We demonstrated that oral administration of SRS, TCF and TNF induce rapid changes in blood PA concentrations. Finally, we showed that TNF supplement is superior to SRS and TCF in elevating the levels of spermidine in the blood, liver and heart following a 28-day supplementation period. Considering the importance of PAs in prevention of age-related disease, supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards the maintenance of proper cellular PA homeostasis during aging.

Polyamines (PAs), namely spermidine and spermine, including their precursor putrescine, are naturally occurring, positively charged alkylamines that are present in every living cell and are essential for a wide range of cellular physiological processes and functions [1]. PAs are abundant across all kingdoms of life and have attracted the attention of researchers because of their many diverse functional roles in cardio- and neuroprotection, neuromodulation, lifespan extension, and prevention of age-related diseases [1–12]. Multiple lines of research evidence suggest that higher dietary intakes of PAs are associated with lower mortality rates and reduced incidence of diseases in humans [11–17]. In addition, recent studies demonstrated an important relationship between blood PA concentrations, the ratios of individual PAs, and healthy life span [17–19]. PAs have essential and diverse cellular functions, which include structural stabilization of RNA and DNA [20–22], DNA condensation [23], RNA processing [24,25], regulation of gene expression [25,26], protein synthesis and posttranslational modification [27], reducing oxidative stress [28], promoting cell growth and cell cycle progression [29], and possible regulation of autophagy, mitophagy, apoptosis and inflammation [30–34], among others [7,35–39]. Essentially, PAs are vital for cell survival, and their depletion would severely compromise cellular growth and function [40]. As organisms age, however, PA levels in tissues decline, contributing to the disruption of many molecular pathways associated with age-related diseases [41–44]. The pools of PAs in the body are maintained through three distinct routes: 1) endogenous synthesis, 2) production of PAs by the microorganisms residing in the intestinal tract, and 3) dietary intake – the most important and also modifiable source of PAs [10]. Among the dietary sources of PAs are diverse foods of plant and animal origins, many of which are found abundantly in Mediterranean diets that are thought to promote longevity and prevent age-related diseases [14,39,41,45,46]. Among the plant sources, wheat germ is one of the richest in PAs, especially spermidine [47]. High concentrations of PAs are also found in foods of animal origin, such as edible offal (organ meats), including intestine, thymus and liver [14,45,48,49]. Of note, consumption of offal and other foods that are common in Mediterranean diets (i.e., fermented foods, vegetables, fruit), is much lower in the countries with predominant Western diets, which may have an impact on overall population longevity and health during aging [50,51]. PAs that come from either the diet or gut microflora are absorbed intact in the gut lumen, but their concentrations drop from millimolar to low micromolar ranges rapidly after ingestion through poorly understood mechanisms, making PAs “high supply and low utilization” compounds [52,53]. Even though specialized carriers have been proposed to mediate PA transport across intestinal enterocytes, their affinity for PAs may differ based on their location at the apical versus basal membranes of enterocytes, while PAs that are absorbed are quickly distributed across tissues with high proliferative demands, including the cells of the gastrointestinal tract itself.[54–56] In addition, PAs that reach rat tissues 6 hours following exogenous PA administration mediate a 30−300 fold increase in the activity of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), an enzyme involved in the conversion of higher PAs back to putrescine, thereby limiting their availability.[57] Consistent with this, supplementation with high doses of spermidine, whether in the form of a supplement or in the context of spermidine-rich foods, does not increase its levels in plasma or in saliva [58–60]. Multiple studies in humans and in rodents demonstrated that supplementation with foods rich in PAs, even for as long as 1 year in humans, does not increase blood spermidine levels, while spermine levels can gradually increase [11,53,61]. These studies confirm that the bioavailability of food-derived spermidine is very low. Indeed, concentrations of PAs in the blood depend on the maintenance of PA homeostasis, which is a tightly controlled and highly dynamic process [17,56,62]. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine, which can be further converted to spermine, while a series of acetylation and oxidation reactions mediate the conversion of the higher PAs back to their precursors (Fig 1) [63]. A set of enzymes and antizymes, whose activity and/or expression are regulated by the abundance of their substrates, putrescine or higher PAs, as well as by many environmental factors, including injuries or pathologic conditions, mediates rapid bi-directional interconversion of each of the PAs into a different type and their import, export, metabolism and catabolism, and controls the changes in PA ratios. Yet, blood PA levels, and PA ratios specifically, can serve as biomarkers of human health status [64–66]. Spermidine is synthesized from putrescine by spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermine is produced from spermidine by spermine synthase (SMS). Direct conversion of spermine to spermidine is mediated by spermine oxidase (SMO). Additional pathways converting spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, require sequential actions of spermine/spermidine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO) enzymes.

Illustration created in Biorender.com. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g001 Importantly, PA catabolism increases following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other types of insults to the central nervous system (CNS), leading to reduced spermidine levels in the brain and in the blood [67–69]. Spermidine supplementation, on the other hand, was shown to exert a neuroprotective effect in the context of TBI, such that the recovery from TBI is enhanced in rodents receiving spermidine prior to and post-injury [69]. Coincidentally, we recently demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus gland (Thymus – Nuclear Fraction, TNF) by showing that supplementation of rats with TNF prior to and post TBI accelerated their functional recovery [70]. Given that thymus is a glandular organ that could potentially be a good dietary source of PAs [45,48,49], we hypothesized that TNF supplement may deliver bioavailable PAs, which would partially explain the observed neuroprotective role of TNF supplementation. In the current study we investigated whether TNF supplement contains PAs and could change their circulating levels when administered orally. We compared a whole food supplement containing defatted wheat germ, termed spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), with bovine thymus extracts – TNF, thymus cytosolic fraction (TCF) and thymus desiccated (freeze dried) material (TD), as well as nuclear fractions of bovine liver and heart (LNF and HNF), with respect to their PA content and effectiveness in increasing blood and tissue PA levels. We show that SRS contains the highest amount of spermidine among the tested supplements, yet TNF is a supplement that predominantly delivers the liposomal, bioavailable form of spermidine and is capable of elevating its levels in the blood, liver and heart following 28 days of oral supplementation in rats. Together, these results represent the first demonstration that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus is a source of bioavailable forms of PAs and can increase the levels of spermidine in the blood and in tissues. All nutritional supplements evaluated in this study were obtained from Standard Process Inc. (Palmyra, WI, USA) and are commercially available as nutritional supplements. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from frozen raw bovine glands and dried on-site using Standard Process Inc. proprietary processes. Briefly, the cytoplasmic cellular material was extracted following incubation of the raw homogenized thymus tissue in water, while the nuclear material was isolated using salts following the removal of the cytoplasmic material. No extraction procedures were applied towards the desiccated, freeze-dried thymus material. All test products are in powder form and are suitable for consumption by animals and humans. The following supplements were used: 1) Spermidine-Rich supplement (SRS) containing plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials (a proprietary blend containing bovine liver, organic beet [root], nutritional yeast, defatted wheat germ, rice bran, organic sweet potato, organic carrot, and bovine adrenal gland), 2) bovine thymus cytosolic fraction extract (TCF), 3) bovine thymus nuclear fraction extract (TNF), 4) desiccated bovine thymus (TD), 5) bovine liver nuclear fraction extract (LNF) and 6) bovine heart nuclear fraction extract (HNF). Measurements of individual PA concentrations in nutritional supplements were conducted by Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg) using high-performance liquid chromatography method EN ISO 19343, essentially as described in Duflos et al. (2019) [71]. Two lots of materials were tested for each supplement. Cryo-TEM was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Solutions were prepared from supplement powders at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, centrifuged, and the supernatant was used in grid preparation. A 5 µl solution aliquot was placed on a thin copper grid that had been glow discharged. For preparation of the grid, the samples were loaded into the freezing chamber at low temperature (0–5°C) under humidity control (100%). After blotting for 3 seconds (s) with filter paper, the specimen was rapidly frozen with cryogen – liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The prepared grid was mounted for imaging using a 200 kV FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope. DLS analysis was conducted at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Ten mg of each supplement powder were resuspended in 0.1 mL of water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used in particle size analysis following the Zetasizer Nano Series manufacturer’s standard protocol (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom). NTA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). The NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom) was calibrated using 100 nm beads and primed with filtered 1X PBS since the nanoparticles are isolated in PBS. The stock dilutions of nanoparticles were prepared in 1X PBS and samples were injected into the instrument using a 1 cc syringe. Individual particles were visualized in real-time and NTA was performed at 25 °C using a 488 nm laser. Data were collected from 11 positions. HPLC analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) essentially as described in Tamim et al (2002) [72]. Briefly, HPLC method consisted of a perchloric acid extraction step, derivatization step using dansyl chloride, separation step using elution gradient of methanol and water, and fluorescence-based detection. HPLC results were calculated using a calibration curve created using the same methodology as used for sample analysis. One gram of each supplement powder was resuspended in 10 mL of water and centrifuged to remove the insoluble precipitate. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 g for 2 hrs to collect the liposomal nanoparticles. After centrifugation, the liposomal nanoparticles were resuspended in 10 mL water and thoroughly mixed with 0.5% triton X-100, and the liposomes were destroyed by slight shock. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Amounts of loaded spermidine, spermine and putrescine were determined by HPLC. Encapsulation efficiency was determined using the following formula: S1 Table shows the detailed procedures used for characterization of PA encapsulation. The detection limit of the HPLC assay used was 5 ppm; 1 ppm = 1 µg/mL. RNA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) following the Quant-iT™ RNA Assay Kit’s standard manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, High Point, NC, USA). RNA standards were prepared by adding 10 µL of each of the E. coli rRNA standard in diluted RNA buffer to separate wells in triplicate and mixing. Ten µL of each unknown RNA sample were added to separate wells and mixed well. Two hundred µL of the working solution (diluted Quant-iT™ RNA reagent) were loaded onto each microplate well and fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (excitation/emission maxima were 644/673 nm) and RNA amounts were determined using the E. coli rRNA-based standard curve. The encapsulation efficiency for RNA followed the same method described in the section above. DNA quantification was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) using AlphaLISA Host Cell Residual DNA Detection Kit (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA Detection Buffer (1X) was made by adding 10 mL of 10X buffer stock solution and 2 mL of UltraPure BSA to 88 mL of pure water. MIX solutions (2.5X) were prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL Anti DNA Acceptor beads and 50 µL of 500 nM Biotinylated Anti DNA to 9.9 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. Streptavidin (SA) Donor beads solution (2X; 20 µg/mL) was prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL SA-Donor beads to 12.45 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. For DNA amount quantification, 5 µL of each sample was incubated with 20 µL of 2.5X MIX solution for 1 hour at 23°C, followed by adding 25 µL of 2X SA- Donor beads solution and incubation for 30 min at 23°C. Plates were read using SpectraMax® M5e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, United Kingdom) at 615nm. The encapsulation efficiency for DNA followed the same method described above. All animal studies were conducted at PsychoGenics, Inc. (Paramus, New Jersey, USA); all housing and testing of the rats were conducted in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and the approval of PsychoGenics Inc., Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in AAALAC-accredited facilities. A total of eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats, 9 weeks old, fitted with jugular vein catheters (JVCs), weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and 18 male SpragueDawley rats, 9 weeks old, without JVCs, weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), were used for the acute and chronic supplementation studies, respectively. Animal catheterization was performed at Envigo (Indianapolis, IN, USA) prior to their arrival. Animals were assigned unique identification numbers (tail marks), were housed in pairs in ventilated cages and were examined, handled, weighed and acclimated for 7 days prior to the initiation of the study to assure adequate health and suitability. 12/12 light/dark cycles, 20–23°C room temperature and a relative humidity of approximately 50% were maintained during the study. Body weights (BWs) were measured 2 times per week throughout the study. Chow (Lab diet 5001, LabDiets, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water were provided ad libitum. Testing was conducted during the light cycle, and rats in the same cage received the same treatment. Rats with JVCs were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals housed in the same cage all received the same treatment. Tested nutritional supplements (raw material powders containing active ingredients) were administered orally (oral gavage, PO) at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg as follows: SRS – 645 mg/kg body weight (BW), TCF – 1276 mg/BW and TNF – 1411 mg/BW. These doses delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine and were calculated based on the varying amounts of PAs and excipients present in each supplement. Blood (300 µl) was collected from JVC at the following timepoints: 0 min (blood drawing prior to dosing, baseline), 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after dose administration.[73,74] Blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at – 80°C. Rats were decapitated using guillotine at the end of the study. Rats were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals in the same cage all received the same treatment. Nutritional supplements were administered orally, 2 times per day, at a dose volume of 5 ml/kg and a dose of 175 mg/kg BW (350 mg/kg BW per day) for 28 days. Considering an average human weight of 65 kg and a conversion factor of 6.2 between rat and human, the human equivalent dose would be approximately 3.4 grams per day [75]. The approximate daily amounts of spermidine delivered by this dose for each supplement were as follows: SRS – 0.072 mg/kg BW, TCF – 0.034 mg/kg BW, and TNF – 0.050 mg/kg BW. This daily dose given to rats is equivalent to human doses of 0.76, 0.36 and 0.53 mg of spermidine for SRS, TCF and TNF, respectively. For baseline blood collection, blood (300 µl) was collected from tail vein into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C. Animals were not administered tested supplements on the day of terminal tissue collection (Day 29). On Day 29, Rats were decapitated using guilootine, and trunk blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen on dry ice. Brains, hearts and livers were weighed, and flash frozen on dry ice. All tissue samples were stored at −80°C. Quantitative analysis of a total of 198 blood/tissue samples for the amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was performed by Creative Proteomics (Shirley, NY, USA) using an AB SCIEX API 4000 mass spectrometry instrument (Danaher Corporation, Washington, D.C., USA) connected to Waters Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) instrument (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA). Fifty µL of each blood sample were mixed with 200 µL of ice-cold methanol (with 0.5% formic acid) in a 2 mL tube and vortexed for 3 min. After 10 min of ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample were injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. All tissue samples (brain, liver and heart) were lyophilized before weighing. Briefly, 50 mg of each sample and 3 steel beads were placed into a 2.0 mL tube and 1 mL water (with 0.5% formic acid) was added to each tube. The samples were homogenized by a bead beater for 10 min. After 10 min ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. Each sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample was injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine standards were dissolved in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to achieve 1 mg/mL stocking solutions. The standards were diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to get gradient concentrations from 1 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. Ten μL of each sample were used for the UPLC-MS/MS. Chromatographic condition: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 150 mm 1.8 µm) coupled with a VanGuard precolumn (2.1 × 5 mm 1.8 µm). LC parameters: Mobile Phase A – pure water (with 0.5% formic acid); Mobile Phase B – acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid). The column temperature was held at 40°C. The sample chamber temperature was held at 10°C. Flow rate was 0.25 mL/min. The elution gradients are shown in S2 Table. Mass Spectrometry parameters: MS condition – ESI positive mode; Ion source temperature – 450°C; IS – 4500 V; CAD – 10 psi; CUR – 40 psi; GS1–45 psi; GS2–45 psi; Q1 and Q3 parameters for measured PAs are shown in S3 Table. Acute changes in blood PA levels in Study 1 were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test. Paired Student’s t-test was used to compare changes in blood PA levels from Day 0 to day 29, following 28 days of supplementation in Study 2. Changes in tissue PA levels were compared using Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis. Significant changes with p values < 0.05 are marked by an asterisk (*). Graphical data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (La Jolla, CA, USA, RRID: SCR_002798). To begin investigating whether nutritional supplements that are composed of materials derived from plants/animal tissues contain PAs we evaluated SRS, TCF, TNF, LNF, HNF materials, and the freeze-dried, desiccated thymus material (TD), for concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, histamine and cadaverine. We found that the SRS, which consists of both plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials, contained the highest levels of spermidine among the tested supplements (206.73 mg/kg) (Fig 2). The cytosolic and the nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, TCF and TNF, contained lower amounts of spermidine compared to SRS (97.14 mg/kg and 143.86 mg/kg, respectively), while TNF had the highest levels of putrescine among all the tested supplements (Fig 2). Desiccated thymus material, on the other hand, was not rich in either putrescine, spermidine or spermine. Neither LNF nor HNF contained appreciable amounts of the most abundant PAs – spermidine and spermine. These data show that a supplement containing wheat germ, which is rich in spermidine, as well as cytosolic and nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, can potentially be good sources of spermidine, spermine and putrescine. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g002 A study by Acosta-Andrade et al. (2017) has shown that PAs can induce aggregation of lipid vesicles, such as liposomes [76]. Liposomal delivery of nutrient compounds, as well as drugs, is considered more efficient compared to the delivery of unencapsulated materials because liposomes are stable, lipids-based nanoparticles that are resistant to breakdown through digestion or oxidation, and hence can improve the bioavailability of their cargo [77]. To test whether nutritional supplements containing PAs also contain liposomes we performed Cryo-TEM analysis of the SRS, TCF, TNF and the desiccated thymus material, TD. Supplements that did not contain appreciable levels of PAs were excluded from further study. We detected liposomes in solutions of SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (Fig 3A–C), while TD was devoid of liposomal structures (Fig 3D). (A-D) Representative images of SRS, TCF, TNF and TD supplements, show the presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF (A-C; red arrows), but not in TD (D).

NTA analysis further revealed that SRS contains the highest numbers of liposomal particles compared to TCF and TNF supplements (Table 2). Together, these data demonstrate that the tested supplements composed of plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials contain liposomal particles, which are known to protect the encapsulated molecules from premature breakdown, thus increasing their bioavailability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t002 The presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF nutritional supplements led us to investigate whether PAs in these supplements were encapsulated within the liposomes. Each of the supplements was examined in 3 distinct ways (see Materials and Methods): 1) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in perchloric acid solutions of supplement powders using HPLC (assessing total free PA content), 2) total putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in solutions following the destruction of the liposomes (assessing total PA content), and 3) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in destructed liposomes specifically (assessing encapsulated PA content). We found that among the tested supplements, TNF contained the highest total amounts of PAs, measured following the destruction of the liposomes (Total PA content; Table 3). The encapsulation efficiency of PAs was difficult to assess, most likely due to the known vulnerability of liposomes to destruction during the ultracentrifugation process, resulting in losses of certain types of entrapped molecular cargo [79,80]. Relatively low abundance of liposomes in the solutions of each supplement (Table 2; Fig 3) and the limitations of the HPLC assay used (detection limit of 5 µg/mL) could have also contributed to low recovery of the encapsulated PAs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t003 Partly owing to their positive charge, most PAs within the cells are bound to RNA and exist in PA-RNA complexes [24,38]. We therefore examined whether liposomal particles found in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements contain RNA. We found that RNA was present in all the tested supplements and that RNA in the TNF supplement was predominantly contained within the liposomal particles, evidenced by the highest encapsulation efficiency detected for TNF (91%) (Table 4). Negligible amount of DNA was detected in TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements (S4 Table). These results show that RNA molecules can be potentially delivered by the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements, with most of the RNA contained in the TNF supplement being encapsulated within the liposomal particles. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t004 Rapid cyclic interconversion and catabolism of PAs are intricately regulated processes that partly rely on the tissue abundance of each of the PAs and ultimately determine their levels in the blood [63]. To begin investigating whether PAs present in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements are bioavailable and can impact circulating PA levels, we measured blood PA concentrations at baseline and 5 timepoints within a 6-hour period following supplement administration to rats by oral gavage. Each supplement was administered at a dose that delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine. As expected, we observed rapid changes in the concentrations of PAs in response to the oral delivery of each of the three tested supplements, with these changes being highly similar between the groups (Fig4). First, blood levels of putrescine were moderately decreased 1 hour after the gavage procedure, followed by a gradual increase in blood putrescine levels with each of the three supplements (Fig 4A, B; p < 0.0001); a significant effect of time variable was observed at 6 hours after supplement administration compared to baseline (Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine gradually and significantly decreased during the 6 hours after the oral gavage procedure (Fig 4C, D; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 1–6 hours following supplement administration (Baseline vs 1 hour: p = 0.0006; Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). Blood levels of spermine, on the other hand, steadily increased following supplement administration (Fig 4E, F; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 2–6 hours after supplement administration (Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p = 0.021; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). These results show that oral administration of either SRS, TCF or TNF leads to rapid increases in blood concentrations of putrescine and spermine, and a decrease in spermidine. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods). N = 6 animals per group. PA concentrations are shown in (A, C, E) and concentration changes compared to baseline in (B, D, F). Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; * - significant effect of Time variable by Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test, p < 0.05. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods). N = 6 animals per group. PA concentrations are shown in (A, C, E) and concentration changes compared to baseline in (B, D, F). Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; * - significant effect of Time variable by Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test, p < 0.05. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g004 Having established that the SRS and bovine thymus gland-derived cytosolic and nuclear extracts contain liposomal particles and can deliver liposomal PAs, we hypothesized that prolonged supplementation with the SRS, TCF or TNF would have a distinct effect on PA homeostasis in the blood and in tissues compared to the observed rapid changes in blood PA levels shortly after supplement administration. Sustained delivery of liposomal PAs could potentially affect the enzymes and antizymes involved in PA metabolism and catabolism at the transcriptional and translational levels. We therefore assessed blood and tissue PA concentrations in rats supplemented with the SRS, TCF and TNF for 28 days. Each supplement was administered orally at the same dose of 175 mg/kg BW twice per day. We found that the blood levels of putrescine were reduced by over 15% following sustained supplementation with SRS and TCF, and by over 30% with TNF administration compared to baseline levels (Fig 5A, B; Tables 5–6). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine increased following sustained SRS and TNF supplementation, with TNF administration resulting in the largest blood spermidine increase of over 22% (Fig 5C, D; Tables 5–6). Finally, blood levels of spermine were modestly reduced only with SRS supplementation (Fig 5E, F; Tables 5–6), tended to increase with TNF treatment, and remained largely unchanged in TCF-supplemented animals compared to baseline. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t006 (A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0).

(A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0).

We found that the levels of all three PAs in brain tissues were not significantly different between the SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (Fig 6A–C; Table 7). However, the levels of spermidine and spermine in the heart and liver tissues differed between the supplementation groups. Specifically, TNF-supplemented animals displayed increased levels of spermidine in the heart compared to TCF-supplemented group (Fig 6E; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0461 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). In the liver, spermidine levels were significantly higher in TNF-supplemented animals compared to SRS-supplemented animals (Fig 6H; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0043 by Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc analysis; Table 7), accompanied by the increased levels of spermine (Fig 6I; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0232 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). Liver putrescine levels remained unchanged between the groups (Fig 6G; Table 7). Importantly, no significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which are known to decrease in diseased states, were observed in the blood or tissues of TNF-supplemented animals, while blood spermine/spermidine ratio decreased with SRS supplementation (S2 Fig) [18,81]. Thus, among the three tested supplements, TNF is most potent at raising the blood and tissue levels of spermidine and spermine without affecting the spermine/spermidine ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t007 Concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in tissues of supplemented animals at the end of the 28-day supplementation period. (A-C) In brain tissues, no differences in PA levels were observed between the supplementation groups. (D-F) In heart tissues, TNF supplementation resulted in increased spermidine levels compared to TCF-supplemented animals. (G-I) In the liver, spermidine and spermine levels were higher in TNF-supplemented compared to SRS-supplemented animals. Data are shown as individual values and the mean; N = 4-6 animals per group. * - P < 0.05 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis (see Table 6). Concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in tissues of supplemented animals at the end of the 28-day supplementation period. (A-C) In brain tissues, no differences in PA levels were observed between the supplementation groups. (D-F) In heart tissues, TNF supplementation resulted in increased spermidine levels compared to TCF-supplemented animals.

Data are shown as individual values and the mean; N = 4-6 animals per group. * - P < 0.05 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis (see Table 6). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g006 Diets rich in PAs are considered beneficial for supporting optimal health and may promote longevity [11,12,17,82]. Considering that endogenous PA synthesis may gradually diminish with age, along with the increasing PA catabolism, reduction in PA production by the gut bacteria and compromised intestinal absorption during aging, nutritional supplementation with PA-containing products and increased dietary intake of PA-rich foods are plausible approaches towards ensuring adequate availability of PAs in older adults [1,9,14,16,82,83]. However, elevating the circulating levels of PAs in the blood, which are thought to reflect their tissue levels as well, through dietary supplementation appears to be challenging [5,53,58,60,82]. In this study, we describe a novel finding that the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of bovine thymus gland, TCF and TNF, as well as a nutritional supplement containing wheat germ, SRS, can all serve as the sources of dietary PAs, with TNF being most potent at elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine. Among the materials tested in this study, TNF elicited the largest increase in blood spermidine levels (22%) after 28 days of supplementation. This effect of TNF is not likely to be mediated strictly by the total amounts of PAs it contains, but to their liposomal encapsulation in this particular type of thymus gland extract. Indeed, we found that the concentration of total spermidine is the highest in the SRS material, which contains wheat germ (approximately 207 mg/kg) – nearly double the amounts detected in TCF and TNF (approximately 86 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg, respectively). This finding is consistent with the reports that wheat germ is a good dietary source of PAs [47]. Between the bovine thymus gland-derived supplements, however, TNF contains the lowest amount of spermine, but the highest amount of PA precursor – putrescine (approximately 152 mg/kg). Surprisingly, the nuclear fraction extracts of two other bovine organs we tested, liver and heart, do not contain appreciable amounts of putrescine, spermidine or spermine, suggesting that PA content in these extracts may be low due to distinct cellular compositions of liver and heart tissues compared to thymus, or due to losses during the nuclear material extraction procedure. Nevertheless, this study is the first to report on the presence of PAs in nutritional supplements composed of natural ingredients, including bovine glandular tissue extract and wheat germ, and the effects of these supplements on PA homeostasis in vivo. Nutritional supplementation with PAs is typically approached using plant extracts, including bacterial fermentation products (i.e., wheat germ extract; natto), or synthetic PA forms [1,53,58,59]. Liposomal forms of spermidine are also available as supplements and can potentially increase its bioavailability, but to our knowledge, their effectiveness in supporting blood or tissue PA levels has yet to be reported. In this study, we show that SRS, TCF and TNF contain lipid nanoparticles that fit the characteristics of liposomes – bilayer vesicles composed of lipids and phospholipids, which can spontaneously form in aqueous solutions and primarily encapsulate hydrophilic molecules present in such solutions (i.e., positively charged polyamines) [84]. Interestingly, the concentration of lipid nanoparticles in the SRS (5.15x108 particles/mL) is nearly double their concentration in the TNF supplement (2.53x108 particles/mL), while nanoparticle average size is the largest in TNF among the tested supplements – 285 nm compared to 151 nm in TCF and 207 nm in the SRS. The size distribution of the observed nanoparticles (151–258 nm in diameter), combined with their presence in the extracts of the intracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear materials, excludes the possibility of them being either exosomes, which only reach approximately 100 nm is diameter, or other types of extracellular, secreted microvesicles [85,86]. The PDI values, which serve as measures of liposome quality during their production, were below 0.7 for all three tested supplements, indicating that liposomal particles contained in these materials are relatively uniform with respect to their sizes [87]. Unlike the artificial liposomes designed for the improvement of drug or vitamin/nutrient formulations and delivery, which are typically produced using defined ratios of phospholipids isolated from soy, eggs, milk, bacteria or synthetic phospholipids [84,88–91], self-assembly of liposomes found in the SRS, TCF and TNF is likely to be induced during the extraction process from the lipids that naturally exist within the plant and animal tissue intracellular materials. Hence, we observed that the desiccated (freeze dried) thymus material, which was not subjected to the extraction process, does not contain liposomal particles. While the sizes of liposomes observed in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (> 151 nm) suggest that they are likely to enter cells via endocytosis [87], and micropinocytosis specifically, further studies are needed to determine the precise lipid compositions of these particles, their content and physiological properties. Because PAs can promote aggregation and fusion of liposomes, and often exist within the molecular complexes containing RNA, it is not surprising that these lipid particles are found in PA-rich extracts of plant and thymus gland materials used in this study, and also contain RNA in addition to PAs [24,76,92]. Yet, the amounts of PAs and RNA encapsulated in the liposomes vary greatly between the supplements we examined. We show that the concentrations of liposomal PAs, and spermidine in particular, are severalfold higher in the TNF supplement compared to the SRS and TCF materials, and that over 90% of the RNA detected in TNF material is encapsulated within the liposomes. Therefore, it is likely that the delivery of larger amounts of liposomal, as opposed to free PAs, underlies the capacity of TNF supplement to elevate blood and tissue levels of spermidine following a 28-day supplementation period compared to the SRS and TCF. The presence of RNAs within the tested supplements, on the other hand, confirms that lipid nanoparticle-RNA formulations are quite stable [93–95], and that a range of bioactive molecules, including PA-RNA complexes, are encapsulated in the liposomes derived from the animal and plant material extracts. Contrary to appreciable levels of RNA, we detected a small amount of DNA in the TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements, possibly due to DNA degradation and losses in aqueous solutions during plant and animal material extraction processes, especially if salts were present (i.e., salt-dependent proprietary extraction method of nuclear material) [96,97]. We confirmed that larger amounts of RNA compared to DNA are found across multiple nuclear fraction extracts of bovine tissues prepared using the same methodology as TNF. Thus, the technology utilized in the extraction of plant and animal tissue materials, and the types of lipids and soluble molecules present in various types of biological matrices, can determine the probability of liposomal particle assembly and the molecular cargo of the liposomes produced, including the final molecular composition of the product [98]. This study highlights the unique properties of nutritional supplements composed of plant and animal tissue-derived materials and their capacity to deliver a range of bioactive molecules within naturally occurring matrices, including liposomal particles. The bioavailability of PAs contained in the SRS, TCF and TNF is first evidenced by our finding that one dose of each supplement exerts pronounced and immediate effects on blood PA levels. Within 6 hours following supplement administration at doses that in humans would be equivalent to 1.29–2.12 mg of spermidine, we observed gradual and significant increases in blood putrescine and spermine levels (approximately 30%), while spermidine levels gradually declined by approximately 40%. Lack of significant differences in the directions and kinetics of blood PA concentration changes among the three supplementation groups could be explained by comparable concentrations of free, non-liposomal spermine and spermidine in tested supplements that could drive the rapid changes in blood PA levels. The observed increase in blood spermine levels in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals is consistent with previous studies that reported its changes in the blood in response to PA-rich extracts or foods [58,82,99,100]. In addition, preferential association of spermine with cellular membranes or nucleic acids in vivo may contribute to the lower affinity of SSAT enzyme, which regulates cellular PA content, for spermine compared to its acetylated form, N1-acetylspermine, possibly leading to the temporary increase in spermine we observed in this part of the study [101]. An increase in blood putrescine levels, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to occur temporarily in response to spermidine administration in rats, peaking at 6 hours, and to be mediated by PA-dependent induction of SSAT and subsequent conversion of N1-acetylspermidine to putrescine by polyamine oxidase (PAO) [102]. This mechanism could partly explain the temporary depletion of spermidine and concomitant increase in putrescine during the 6-hour period following supplement administration. The increases in blood spermidine levels after 28 days of supplementation with TNF and SRS at doses delivering relatively low total amounts of spermidine, equivalent to approximately 0.53 mg and 0.76 mg per day in humans, respectively, further support the bioavailability of PAs present in these materials. This finding adds to the current understanding of dietary PA metabolism, which is based on studies that reported increases in blood or tissue spermidine levels only with substantially higher spermidine doses or longer supplementation periods [5,53,58,59,100,102]. The observed reduction in blood putrescine levels across the supplementation groups could be explained by possible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme by exogenous PAs through Antizyme 1-mediated degradation, leading to attenuated putrescine synthesis [103]. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), an enzyme catalyzing the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet), which serves a rate limiting role in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine [104,105], and ODC can both be inhibited by spermine and spermidine as part of the mechanism regulating intracellular PA homeostasis, leading to reduced endogenous synthesis of spermine/spermidine and a reduction in putrescine, respectively [106]. SSAT, a key enzyme responsible for the conversion of spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, is activated/induced by spermine and spermidine themselves, and may prevent the rise in blood levels of spermine [101,102]. At the same time, the activities of PAO, which can use spermine, N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine as substrates, but not spermidine, and spermine oxidase (SMO), can potentially contribute to the elevation in blood levels of spermidine, and not spermine, we observed following 28 days of supplementation with TNF [102,107,108].. The concentrations of PAs in the blood and tissues are linked, such that the variation in health status and diets across individuals contributes to varying blood PA levels observed in human and animal studies, with and without dietary supplementation regimens [5,82]. For example, inflammatory conditions and cancer, among other pathologies, can both lead to dysregulation of PA homeostasis, reflected by either diminished or elevated blood and tissue levels of individual PAs [18,82,109]. Variability in dietary intakes of PA-containing foods can further contribute to inter-personal differences in circulating PA levels [14]. Consistent with this, we detected variability in baseline blood PA levels among the animal groups undergoing 28-day supplementation regimens. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that TNF supplement is superior to the SRS and TCF in increasing blood spermidine concentration compared to baseline values, and in elevating the levels of spermidine in the heart and liver tissues. Consistent with the reports of poor brain penetrance of circulating PAs, we did not detect differences in brain PA levels among the supplementation groups [110,111]. Similarly, we did not detect significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which can reflect diseased states [18,19,81], in the blood and tissues of TNF-supplemented animals – TNF elicited a moderate increase in blood spermine levels concurrently with spermidine, and a significant increase in liver spermine levels compared to the SRS group. On the contrary, an increase in blood spermidine levels with SRS supplementation was not accompanied by an increase in blood spermine levels, leading to a reduction in blood spermine/spermidine ratio in this group. Even though it remains to be determined whether liposomal particles present in each of the tested supplements are transported intact across the intestinal enterocytes or taken up within the Pyer’s patches, as opposed to releasing their content in the intestine [112], TNF, and to a lesser extent SRS, are potent at delivering bioavailable forms of PAs that, even at relatively low doses, increase blood spermidine levels in 28 days. Considering that elevating the circulating levels of PAs through supplementation has been a challenge, oral delivery of these bioactive molecules within the matrices inherent to animal organs that are naturally rich in PAs, such as the extract of the thymus gland described in this study, appears to be an advantage. Adequate dietary supply of PAs is important for ameliorating inflammatory conditions, including systemic chronic inflammation prevalent among aging individuals and leading to decline in health and age-related diseases [28,113–115]. From improving gut barrier integrity and obesity indices, to direct inhibition of inflammatory diseases and proinflammatory status, dietary PA supplementation was shown to be effective in animal models and in humans [60,115,116]. Likewise, we previously demonstrated that in the context of CNS injury, the neuroprotective role of TNF supplement is accompanied by substantial changes in the expression of genes implicated in the regulation of inflammation, autophagy and tissue repair – the processes that are highly relevant to the maintenance of good health during aging [70]. Considering the proposed general decline in PA status among aging individuals, low intake of organ meats in Western diet, and current difficulties in increasing circulating levels of spermidine through dietary means, nutritional supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards delivering bioavailable forms of PAs and supporting health during aging. The effectiveness of TNF in modulating the circulating levels of PAs in humans remains to be evaluated. In this study, we demonstrated that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (thymus nuclear fraction, TNF) is effective in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine within a 28-day treatment period. Since PA-rich diet plays a vital role in preventing age-related diseases and promoting longevity, maintenance of the adequate dietary supply of PAs during aging is of great importance. To date, dietary supplementation with PA-rich products and foods, even if prolonged, has proven to be ineffective in increasing blood and tissue levels of spermine and spermidine. This study demonstrates that spermidine contained in TNF supplement is encapsulated in naturally occurring liposomal particles, which may underly the effectiveness of TNF in increasing spermidine levels in the blood and in tissues. Moreover, we show that acute versus chronic oral administration of polyamines exert distinct effects on the metabolism of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the blood. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s004 (DOCX) The dimensions of liposomes and their polydispersity indices (PDI) are shown for the SRS (A), TCF (B) and TNF (C). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s005 (TIF) (A) Blood spermine/spermidine ratio was significantly reduced in SRS-supplemented animals compared to baseline, while no differences in spermine/spermidine ratios among the supplementation groups were detected in tissues: brain (B), heart (C) and liver (D).

Here is a look at the breaking news in digital marketing for May 2025. The world of digital marketing is experiencing a seismic shift, and the epicenters are social media and artificial intelligence. As of 2025, these two forces are no longer separate trends but a deeply integrated reality that is rewriting the playbook for brands, advertisers, and consumers alike. From the way you create content to how you connect with your audience, AI is unlocking new efficiencies and capabilities. Are you prepared to adapt your strategy for this new era? The latest breaking news in digital marketing signals a clear and irreversible move toward an AI-first approach. May 2025 has been a landmark month, with industry-shaking announcements that are forcing marketers to rethink their entire marketing strategy. The most significant marketing trends are now directly tied to AI's expanding role in search, advertising, and content discovery. These developments are not on the horizon; they are here now, impacting organic traffic, ad campaign creation, and how brands are perceived online. The following updates explore the critical changes you need to understand to stay competitive. This month, marketing leaders are buzzing about Google's recent announcements, which have profound implications for the industry. The company confirmed a major expansion of its AI Overviews in the U.S., fundamentally altering how search results are presented. This change prioritizes AI-generated summaries, pushing traditional organic listings further down the page and challenging how digital marketers approach SEO. Simultaneously, Google unveiled "AI Max" at its Marketing Live event, an advanced AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of entire paid search campaigns. While promising efficiency, it raises questions about strategic control and brand consistency. These announcements underscore a critical turning point where leveraging AI is no longer optional for achieving business goals. For many, this signals a need to adapt quickly or risk becoming invisible in a search landscape increasingly curated by algorithms. The focus now shifts to how brands can influence these AI systems to protect their visibility and bottom line. This week's hot topics in digital marketing revolve around adapting to an AI-dominated landscape. Marketers are grappling with significant drops in organic traffic, with some studies showing a 15-30% decrease for informational queries due to AI-driven search summaries. This has ignited a race to find new opportunities for visibility. The conversation is centered on practical strategies for this new reality. Performance marketing experts are particularly focused on how to maintain and improve campaign performance when the rules are changing so rapidly. Key discussions from the last week of May 2025 include: These highlights show a clear trend: marketers are moving from discussing AI's potential to actively developing tactics to manage its real-world impact. The social media trends of 2025 are being profoundly shaped by AI, which is disrupting everything from content discovery to user interaction. AI algorithms are not just personalizing feeds; they are creating entirely new ways for users to engage with brands and each other. This is causing a noticeable shift in user behavior across all major social media platforms. As a result, what worked last year may not be effective today. Brands must now contend with AI-driven features that influence what content gets seen and how conversations unfold. The following sections explore how new platforms are emerging and how brands are adapting to this dynamic environment. New social platforms and AI-integrated features are rapidly changing consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. This demographic, in particular, is embracing more interactive and autonomous AI-powered experiences. Instead of static search bars, users are turning to conversational AI assistants within apps to get answers, schedule appointments, and even receive product recommendations. This shift is forcing brands to reconsider the type of content they produce and where they publish it. The emphasis is moving toward providing utility and instant support. Some of the key features gaining traction include: U.S. marketers are reacting by investing in chatbot technology and exploring how to integrate their brands into these new conversational interfaces, recognizing that this is the future of digital interaction. To foster stronger connections with customers, brands are leveraging AI to enable real-time engagement like never before. The goal is to move beyond generic messaging and interact with audiences at the right time with the right offer. This means personalizing every touchpoint of the customer journey, from the first ad they see to post-purchase support. One powerful example is TSB Bank, which used real-time data to personalize loan offers based on recent customer activity. This single change led to a 300% increase in mobile loan sales. This demonstrates the immense potential of using AI to analyze behavior as it happens and respond instantly with relevant content. This proactive approach to engagement is becoming the new standard. Brands are adapting by integrating AI tools that can predict customer needs and automate personalized outreach, ensuring that their message is not only seen but also feels uniquely tailored to each individual. Generative AI has officially moved from a niche technology to a cornerstone of modern digital marketing. Its impact is most visible in content generation, where it is unlocking new capabilities for creating copy, images, and even video at an unprecedented scale. This is fundamentally changing the economics and speed of content marketing. However, the rise of generative AI is about more than just efficiency. It's empowering marketers to test creative variations faster, personalize messaging with greater precision, and uncover insights that guide strategy. The following sections will show how this technology is driving both creativity and hyper-personalization across digital channels. Generative AI is revolutionizing content production by acting as a copilot for content creators. Tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway are now standard in many marketing departments, helping to accelerate everything from brainstorming initial concepts to producing final assets. This allows teams to iterate on ideas much faster than before. As Ron Friedman, Vice President at Mattel Future Lab, states, "Weâre using generative AI as a copilot for ideation, helping us iterate and validate ideas quickly." This sentiment is echoed across industries. For example, Eric Perez at iHeartMedia notes that in a fast-paced environment, AI is a "game changer" for speeding up concept development without sacrificing quality. This technology is not replacing human creativity but augmenting it. It handles the heavy lifting of initial drafts and visual mockups, freeing up marketers to focus on strategy, brand nuance, and the emotional connection that only a human touch can provide. The result is a more efficient and dynamic content creation process. Achieving true personalization at scale has long been a goal for marketers, and AI is finally making it a reality. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real time, AI enables brands to deliver a superior customer experience by serving highly relevant content across all digital channels, from websites to email to social media. However, a significant gap remains between consumer expectations and brand delivery. An Adobe report found that while 71% of consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, only 34% of brands are successfully doing so. AI-enhanced personalization aims to close this gap by moving from segment-based targeting to one-on-one interactions. As Leo Griffin of HanesBrands Inc. explains, "Personalization helps our consumers feel known." This is the core of the strategy: using AI not just to sell, but to build relationships. Brands like Danish telecom provider Telmore are already seeing results, with their AI-driven personalization efforts delivering an 11% sales lift. May 2025 has seen a surge in new AI tools designed to give marketers a competitive edge. These innovative solutions offer new capabilities for everything from consumer research to ad campaign management. The rapid adoption of AI is being driven by tools that are not only powerful but also increasingly accessible to teams of all sizes. One of the most talked-about launches was Google's AI Max platform, but it is just one of many new technologies entering the market. The following sections highlight some of the other groundbreaking solutions that are helping marketers work smarter and achieve better results. Beyond major platform updates, a range of innovative AI solutions are empowering digital marketers to refine their marketing strategy. These tools are designed to solve specific challenges, from understanding consumer sentiment to optimizing content for search engines. Many are becoming indispensable parts of the modern marketing tech stack. One standout tool is GWI Spark, an AI assistant that provides instant consumer insights from global survey data, allowing marketers to ask questions in natural language and get actionable answers in seconds. This democratizes research and enables faster, more data-driven decision-making. Other key solutions gaining traction include: These tools are not just about automation; they provide strategic insights that help marketers stay ahead of the curve. Major digital advertising platforms are deeply embedding AI into their core offerings, making these AI tools essential for running effective marketing campaigns. These platform integrations are designed to automate and optimize tasks that were once manual, from bidding to creative testing. For marketers, understanding these native tools is just as important as adopting third-party solutions. Google and Meta, for example, have baked AI into nearly every aspect of their advertising products. This helps advertisers improve targeting, generate ad variations, and predict campaign performance with greater accuracy. The goal is to deliver better results with less manual effort, allowing teams to focus more on high-level strategy. Here is a look at some key platform-specific AI integrations as of May 2025: Platform AI Integration/Feature Primary Use Case Google Ads AI Max Generates entire campaigns (headlines, assets, keywords) from a landing page and brand prompts. Google Search AI Overviews Creates AI-generated summaries at the top of search results, changing SEO dynamics. Meta Ads Advantage+ Campaigns Automates audience targeting, ad placement, and creative delivery to maximize performance. GWI GWI Spark An AI research assistant that generates consumer insights from proprietary data on demand. These integrations demonstrate a clear industry trend toward AI-powered automation and optimization within the largest digital ecosystems. Google Marketing Live 2025 was a pivotal event for marketing leaders, with announcements centered on the next evolution of AI in Google Ads. The headline news was the launch of "AI Max," a new platform designed to take Performance Max a step further by using generative AI to build entire campaigns with minimal human input. This development presents both new opportunities and new challenges. While it promises to streamline campaign creation and improve efficiency, it also raises important questions about creative control and strategic oversight. The following sections break down the key innovations revealed at the event. The biggest news in paid search to come out of Google Marketing Live 2025 is AI Max. This platform uses generative AI to build complete campaignsâincluding headlines, descriptions, creative assets, and keyword strategiesâfrom just a landing page URL and a few brand prompts. The goal is to radically simplify the launch of high-performing campaigns and improve overall search performance. Google positions AI Max as a smarter, faster way to achieve results, with predictive insights to guide advertisers. For time-pressed teams, this level of automation could be a significant advantage. It promises to optimize bidding and targeting in ways that are difficult to replicate manually, potentially leading to better visibility in search results. However, advertisers are proceeding with caution. While the efficiency gains are clear, many are wary of handing over complete strategic control to an algorithm. Concerns about brand consistency and the inability to fine-tune campaigns beyond AI Max's suggestions are prevalent. Marketers will need to find a balance between leveraging this powerful automation and maintaining their unique brand voice. The integration with Google Analytics will be crucial for measuring its true impact. While much of the focus at Google Marketing Live was on search, the new AI capabilities also have major implications for display campaigns and social media marketing. The generative AI within platforms like AI Max can create a wide variety of visual assets and ad copy, making it easier for marketers to test different creative approaches across Google's Display Network and YouTube. This allows for the rapid creation of diverse ad campaigns tailored to different audience segments. By automating the generation of images and ad variations, marketers can run more complex tests to see what resonates best with their audience, ultimately improving campaign performance without a proportional increase in creative workload. These enhancements are designed to make cross-channel advertising more cohesive and efficient. The ability to generate assets for display and video alongside search ads from a single set of prompts streamlines the entire campaign creation process. It empowers marketers to maintain a consistent brand message while optimizing performance on every platform. The theoretical benefits of generative AI are compelling, but what do they look like in practice? A growing number of case studies are demonstrating how this technology is driving better results and transforming campaign performance across various industries. These real-world examples show that AI is not just a buzzword but a practical tool for achieving tangible business outcomes. From social media to video content, brands are finding innovative ways to apply AI for higher engagement and greater efficiency. The following examples highlight some of the most successful digital campaigns powered by AI as of May 2025. While specific case studies for May 2025 are just emerging, we can look at how leading brands are applying AI principles to their social media platforms. A notable example involves a global consumer goods brand, similar to L'OrÃ©al or NestlÃ©, that utilized AI tools to overhaul its social media marketing campaigns. The goal was to increase relevance among a younger demographic. The brand used a generative AI platform to create hundreds of visual variations for its ads, each tailored to different audience micro-segments identified by a predictive analytics tool. This allowed them to move beyond broad demographic targeting and speak to individual interests and behaviors. The AI also monitored social media sentiment in real time, allowing the marketing team to adjust messaging on the fly. The results were impressive. The campaign saw a significant lift in key metrics, achieving higher engagement rates and a lower cost per acquisition compared to previous, less-personalized efforts. This success demonstrates how combining generative AI for content with predictive AI for targeting can create a powerful and effective social media strategy. AI is significantly accelerating the production of video content and other forms of creative content. In today's fast-paced content marketing environment, the demand for fresh, engaging visuals is relentless. Generative AI tools like Runway are enabling marketing teams to meet this demand by automating parts of the video creation process, from generating initial storyboards to producing short-form video clips for social media. This technology is not about creating feature films but about streamlining the content generation workflow for marketing campaigns. For instance, a brand can use AI to quickly create multiple versions of a product promo video, each with different background music, text overlays, and calls to action. This allows for rapid A/B testing to determine which version performs best with a target audience. This approach frees up creative teams from repetitive editing tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-level concepts and storytelling. By integrating AI into their creative strategies, brands can produce more content, test more ideas, and ultimately deliver more effective campaigns without burning out their creative resources. The impact of AI on website design and optimization is transformative. AI is enabling a shift from static, one-size-fits-all websites to dynamic, personalized digital experiences. This technology is also reshaping SEO strategies, as marketers must now optimize for both traditional search engine crawlers and the AI algorithms that power generative search results. Are you using AI to its full potential on your website? The following sections explore how AI can create deeply personalized user journeys and dramatically improve conversion rates, turning your website into a more intelligent and effective marketing tool. Creating a truly personalized user experience is a top priority for digital marketers, and AI tools are making it possible. Instead of showing every visitor the same homepage, AI can dynamically alter content, product recommendations, and messaging based on a user's past behavior, location, and other data points. This creates a much more relevant and engaging customer experience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to showcase products that a specific user is likely to be interested in, based on their browsing history. A B2B website might highlight case studies from the visitor's industry. This level of personalization makes visitors feel understood and valued, which can significantly increase engagement and loyalty. Vanguard provides a powerful example of this in action. By using technology to deliver updated, personalized content, the company saw a 176% increase in quality engagement on its new website. This shows that when personalization is done right, the results can be dramatic. Improving conversion rates is a core goal of any digital marketing strategy, and new AI tools are providing powerful new levers for optimization. These tools go beyond traditional A/B testing by using machine learning to analyze user behavior, identify friction points in the customer journey, and automatically test thousands of design and copy variations. For example, an AI tool can analyze session recordings to identify where users are dropping off in the checkout process. It could then suggest and automatically implement changes to the user interface to make the process smoother. This allows for continuous, data-driven optimization that would be impossible to manage manually. This AI-powered approach to conversion rate optimization (CRO) is gaining popularity because it delivers measurable results. By constantly learning and adapting, these tools can significantly lift conversion rates over time. This frees up marketers to focus on the overall strategy while the AI handles the granular details of on-page optimization. AI-powered advertising is quickly becoming the new standard in digital advertising. These strategies use AI to optimize every aspect of a campaign, from identifying the ideal target audience to allocating marketing budgets in real time. This data-driven approach allows for a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable. Marketers are embracing these strategies because they deliver better performance and a higher return on investment. The following sections explore two of the most popular AI-powered tactics gaining traction in May 2025: hyper-targeting and automated ad creation. One of the most powerful applications of AI in advertising is hyper-targeting, which is made possible by dynamic audience segmentation. Instead of creating broad audience buckets, AI can analyze thousands of data signals in real time to group users into highly specific micro-segments based on their current behavior and predicted intent. This process relies heavily on predictive analytics. AI models can forecast which users are most likely to convert, allowing advertisers to focus their ad spend on the most promising prospects. This provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps ensure that ad messages are delivered only to those who will find them most relevant. For example, an online retailer could use AI to identify a segment of users who have recently searched for a specific product, visited a competitor's website, and shown a high likelihood of making a purchase in the next 24 hours. This level of precision makes ad campaigns dramatically more effective and reduces wasted ad spend. The automation of ad creation and performance monitoring is freeing up marketing teams from tedious, time-consuming tasks. With AI tools like Google's AI Max, marketers can now generate hundreds of ad variationsâincluding text, images, and headlinesâin a matter of minutes. This allows for more extensive testing and optimization than ever before. Once campaigns are live, AI continues to play a crucial role in performance monitoring. AI systems can track key metrics in real time, identify underperforming ads, and automatically reallocate budget to the best-performing creative. Some advanced systems can even create new ad variations on the fly based on what's currently resonating with the audience. This level of automation empowers marketing teams to operate at a much larger scale and with greater agility. It allows them to move away from manual campaign management and focus on strategic planning, creative direction, and analyzing the high-level insights that the AI provides. AI is revolutionizing analytics and reporting by making data analysis happen in real time. Instead of waiting for weekly or monthly reports, marketers can now get instant insights into campaign performance. This is particularly valuable for performance marketing, where quick adjustments can have a significant impact on results. These AI innovations are turning data into a strategic asset that can be used to make faster, smarter decisions. The following sections explore how AI is enabling predictive insights and helping brands detect trends and manage crises more effectively. How could your team benefit from instant access to these insights? Predictive analytics is one of the most transformative applications of AI for marketers. By analyzing historical data and real-time trends, AI models can forecast future outcomes, such as which customer segments are likely to grow or which marketing channels will deliver the best ROI. These valuable insights empower marketers to make proactive, data-driven marketing decisions. According to a 2025 Adobe report, leveraging AI and predictive analytics is a top priority for 65% of senior executives aiming for growth. This is because these technologies provide a forward-looking view that helps guide everything from budget allocation to product development. Instead of reacting to past performance, teams can now anticipate market shifts and consumer needs before they even happen. This allows them to allocate resources more effectively and design marketing efforts that are positioned for future success, giving them a significant competitive advantage. In today's fast-moving digital world, real-time trend detection and rapid crisis response are essential. AI tools are becoming indispensable for this, as they can monitor millions of conversations on social media and other online platforms to identify emerging trends and potential PR crises before they escalate. By analyzing sentiment, volume, and the context of online mentions, AI can alert marketing teams to a sudden spike in negative comments or a new meme format that is going viral. This gives brands the ability to respond quickly and appropriately. For trend detection, AI can spot shifts in consumer interests, helping brands create relevant content that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Digital marketing professionals have reacted to the AI updates in May 2025 with a mix of excitement and urgency. They see the potential of these tools for proactive brand management but also recognize the need to develop new workflows to leverage these real-time insights effectively. The rapid adoption of AI is reshaping the digital marketing skills required to succeed in the modern job market. The most valuable members of marketing teams are no longer just specialists in a single channel but professionals who possess a strong degree of AI literacy. They understand how to work alongside AI to achieve better results. This shift is creating new roles and evolving existing ones. The following sections outline the essential skills that digital marketers need to cultivate in 2025 and discuss the importance of training and upskilling to keep pace with technological change. To maintain a competitive advantage, digital marketers must cultivate a new set of must-have skills centered around human-AI collaboration. Marketers who know how to effectively use AI will have a significant edge over those who do not. This isn't about becoming a data scientist; it's about understanding how to leverage AI tools to enhance marketing strategy and execution. These skills enable marketers to guide AI systems, interpret their outputs, and ensure that all automated efforts align with brand goals. The most successful marketing teams will be those that blend technical proficiency with strategic and creative thinking. Key skills for 2025 include: Developing AI literacy across marketing teams is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Forward-thinking organizations are proactively investing in training programs to upskill their employees, ensuring they are comfortable and proficient with the new generation of AI tools. This is crucial for successful AI adoption and for maintaining a competitive edge. These training initiatives range from internal workshops and bootcamps to hands-on sessions with the specific AI tools being used every day. The goal is not to turn every marketer into an AI expert but to build a baseline level of understanding and confidence. When teams feel empowered to use AI, they are more likely to find innovative ways to apply it to their work. Ultimately, the objective is to make AI feel like a natural part of the marketing workflowâa powerful assistant that helps teams work smarter, not a complex technology to be feared. This investment in human capital is just as important as the investment in the technology itself. As AI marketing becomes more powerful, the issues of data privacy, ethics, and trust move to the forefront. Effective personalization relies on data, but consumers are increasingly concerned about how their information is being used. Building and maintaining trust is non-negotiable for long-term success. Striking the right balance between delivering personalized experiences and ensuring robust consumer data protection is a critical challenge. The following sections explore how marketers can navigate this complex landscape by addressing issues like bias and transparency. The central challenge in modern marketing is balancing effective personalization with the non-negotiable need for consumer data protection. While consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, they are also highly concerned about data privacy. This creates a significant trust gap that brands must bridge. According to a 2025 Adobe report, a staggering 88% of consumers believe it's important for brands to handle their data responsibly, yet only 49% of organizations are perceived as meeting this expectation. This gap undermines the very foundation of personalization, as customers will not willingly share data with brands they do not trust. To navigate this, marketers must be transparent about how they collect and use data. This means providing clear privacy policies, giving users control over their information, and ensuring that all data is handled securely. Building trust is not just a legal requirement; it is a strategic imperative for any brand that wants to build lasting customer relationships. A critical aspect of ethical AI involves addressing algorithmic bias and ensuring transparency. AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data contains historical biases, the AI's outputâwhether it's ad targeting or content generationâwill perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This can lead to skewed campaigns and significant reputational damage. Marketers must be vigilant and question the outputs of their AI tools. It's crucial to understand where the data is coming from and to regularly review campaigns for any signs of unfair bias. This requires a commitment to ethics that goes beyond simple compliance. Furthermore, the question of transparency with consumers is becoming more pressing. Should audiences be informed when content is AI-generated? While standards are still evolving, a move toward greater transparency is essential for building long-term trust. Being open about the use of AI can help manage customer expectations and reinforce a brand's commitment to ethical practices. While the benefits of AI are clear, there are several AI challenges that can slow down digital marketing adoption. These hurdles are often not just technological but also organizational. Issues like integrating AI with legacy technology and managing the human side of change are common roadblocks for many companies. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires a strategic approach that focuses on both systems and people. The following sections explore how to tackle integration issues and foster effective human-AI collaboration to ensure a smooth and successful transition. One of the most significant practical hurdles in AI adoption is the integration of AI tools with existing legacy technology. Many organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses, operate on a patchwork of older systems, such as CRMs, CDPs, and analytics platforms. These fragmented systems often create data silos that prevent AI from working effectively. According to a 2025 Adobe report, 32% of organizations point to fragmented IT systems as a key barrier to progress. Attempting to layer sophisticated AI applications on top of a disconnected data foundation often leads to disappointing results. The AI can't access the real-time, unified data it needs to deliver true personalization. To overcome this, organizations must prioritize data unification. This doesn't always mean ripping and replacing old systems. Instead, it can involve investing in platforms that are built for interoperability and can connect disparate data sources. A clear data strategy is the essential first step to unlocking the full potential of AI in digital marketing. While AI promises efficiency, its implementation can sometimes lead to AI fatigue among marketing teams. The pressure to adopt new tools, learn new skills, and manage AI-generated outputs can add strain to existing workflows. A recent study found that 56% of marketing and CX teams report that implementing generative AI creates extra work. The key to avoiding this burnout is to foster a healthy model of human-AI collaboration. This means clearly defining roles: AI handles the heavy liftingâdata analysis, content generation, task automationâwhile humans provide strategic direction, creative judgment, and ethical oversight. This partnership allows teams to benefit from AI's speed and scale without being overwhelmed by it. This collaborative approach is crucial in areas like customer support, where AI chatbots can handle routine inquiries, freeing up human agents to manage more complex and emotionally nuanced issues. By framing AI as a supportive partner rather than a replacement, organizations can build a more sustainable and effective marketing operation. A number of pioneering US brands are already demonstrating the power of AI-driven marketing. Their successes offer valuable case studies and a blueprint for other organizations looking to leverage AI. These companies are moving beyond pilot programs and are embedding AI into their core strategies, leading to measurable improvements in campaign performance. From retail to finance to media, these early adopters are showcasing what's possible when technology is combined with a clear vision. The following examples highlight some of the key learnings and impressive results from these industry leaders. The enterprise adoption of AI is providing powerful case studies and practical learnings for the entire industry. These examples show how large organizations are using AI to solve real-world business problems and unlock new opportunities for growth. A key learning is that success often starts with a specific, well-defined problem. Rather than attempting a massive, all-encompassing AI transformation, leading companies are focusing on high-impact use cases first. This allows them to demonstrate ROI quickly and build momentum for broader adoption. Here are a few examples of how US brands are successfully using AI: The success of AI in marketing is ultimately measured by its impact on the bottom line. The most compelling metrics from May 2025 go beyond vanity numbers and demonstrate tangible business results. These figures provide valuable insights into how AI is improving campaign performance and driving revenue growth. One of the most striking results comes from TSB Bank. By using real-time data to personalize loan offers, the bank increased its mobile loan sales by an incredible 300%. This metric directly ties an AI-driven strategy to a significant increase in sales, showcasing a clear return on investment. Similarly, Danish telecom provider Telmore reported an 11% sales lift from its AI-driven personalization efforts compared to non-personalized experiences. At Vanguard, a focus on personalized web content led to a 176% increase in quality engagement. These are the metrics that matterâthe ones that prove AI is not just a cost center but a powerful engine for growth. Looking ahead, the future outlook for digital marketing is one of ever-deepening AI collaboration. The synergy between social media and AI will continue to evolve, creating new opportunities for brands to connect with audiences in more meaningful and efficient ways. The era of proactive, predictive marketing is just beginning. This next phase will move beyond simple automation to more autonomous systems that can anticipate consumer needs and orchestrate complex customer journeys. What emerging trends should you be preparing for as we head into the second half of 2025? As we look toward the end of the year and into the next year, one of the most significant emerging trends is the rise of "agentic AI." This represents the next evolution of virtual assistants. Instead of just responding to commands, agentic AI systems will be autonomous agents that can take initiative on behalf of the user. Imagine a shopping assistant on a social media app that doesn't just recommend products but, with permission, proactively adds items to a cart based on your style preferences and upcoming events. Or a travel assistant that not only finds flights but also books them, arranges transportation, and suggests itineraries. This is the promise of agentic AI: a concierge-like experience that offers unparalleled convenience and personalization. This shift will move marketing from being reactive to truly proactive, where brands can anticipate and fulfill customer needs before they are even explicitly stated. For marketers, the challenge will be to build the trust and data infrastructure required to power these advanced, autonomous experiences. Increasingly sophisticated consumer expectations demand that marketing teams align their strategies with the dynamic landscape of digital behaviors. Gen Z, for instance, seeks authentic engagement across social media platforms, showcasing the importance of crafting relevant content that resonates with younger audiences. As real-time data analysis becomes more prevalent, businesses utilizing predictive analytics can better refine their marketing campaigns. The incorporation of AI tools also allows for personalized product recommendations and customer service enhancement, fostering stronger connections and ultimately improving conversion rates. This shift not only reshapes customer journeys but also presents new opportunities for marketing leaders to achieve their business goals. KeywordSearch has an AI Audience builder that helps you create the best ad audiences for YouTube & Google ads in seconds.

Focusing on the customer journey is crucial; personalized content and refined email marketing strategies can significantly enhance performance metrics. Embracing these trends will empower businesses to create stronger connections with their target audience, ultimately driving conversions and maximizing the bottom line. In 2025, key AI updates in digital marketing included advanced predictive analytics for consumer insights, enhanced personalization through machine learning algorithms, and automated content generation tools. These innovations significantly improved targeting strategies and customer engagement, aligning with evolving consumer expectations and behaviors. Marketers are adapting to rapid changes in social media and AI by embracing innovative strategies, enhancing customer interaction through personalized content, and leveraging data analytics. This proactive approach helps them stay relevant, meet evolving consumer expectations, and drive engagement effectively. Brands should explore AI-powered tools like chatbots for customer support, sentiment analysis for engagement insights, and content generation platforms to streamline marketing efforts. These tools not only enhance customer experiences but also improve operational efficiency in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. â

Title: After 100 Years, Trillion-Dollar Fund Manager Wellington Wants You to Know Its Name

The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds and building its brand with retail investors. September 5, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co. is a rarity in the investment world: a fund manager with more than $1 trillion of assets and almost zero brand recognition. Not for long. The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is now moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds. Wellington is spending big to hire from bulge-bracket banks and alternative investment firms, adding dozens of private markets professionals to build a unit of about 40 people. It’s also hustling to build a brand with retail investors, many of whom have never heard of the $1.3 trillion firm. It’s a big change for a money manager that for decades didn’t care about what the world thought, as long as its big institutional clients were happy. Among its recent hires, Wellington recruited a head of private investments capital formation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., poached a team from Pacific Investment Management Co. to expand in private credit and hired Christina Kopec Rooney from Goldman’s asset management arm to head its nascent push into the US wealth market. It even partnered with private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Vanguard Group to launch hybrid funds for retail investors. Related:Has the ‘Democratization’ of Alts Gone Too Far? In perhaps its most radical shift, Wellington – housed across 19 floors in Boston’s Atlantic Wharf – has done the previously unthinkable: It hired a public relations team. “It’s unfamiliar,” said Steve Klar, Wellington’s president. It’s a sign of the times. Tectonic shifts in asset management are pushing the firm, and others like it, out of their comfort zone. Traditional asset managers under pressure from outflows and fee compression in their mutual funds are striving to break into the more lucrative private markets to boost their margins and assets before their competitors gain all the spoils. Rivals such as Franklin Resources Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and even the likes of industry giants BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are diving in headfirst, buying alternative investment firms or partnering with private equity shops to launch funds. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will purchase as much as $1 billion of T. Rowe Price shares as the two team up to sell private-market products. Wellington’s Chief Executive Officer Jean Hynes said in an interview at the firm’s headquarters that despite relying mostly on stickier institutional money, she knows the firm isn’t immune to the intense pressures reshaping the asset management industry. Client migration to cheap passive funds has pushed the industry’s average fee down to just 0.3% from about 1% two decades ago, according to Morningstar Inc. (Vanguard — Wellington’s largest client, accounting for about a third of the firm’s assets — charges an average fee of 0.07%.) Related:Baird Takes Stake in Sagard; Will Distribute its Products to Wealth Clients Wellington argues it’s especially well positioned among its peers to go big on private markets. The firm’s executives say its private partnership structure – with no shareholders to answer to – gives the firm control, allowing it to play the long game and retain its tight-knit culture. Michael Carmen, a partner at Wellington who’s behind the expansion, says that an ambitious 10-year plan kicked off in 2023 to grow the private markets unit that now manages only $9.7 billion. He’s even interviewing candidates to start a secondaries business to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, one of the hottest areas in alternative investing. Its new emphasis on higher-fee alternatives is already shifting internal power dynamics at a time when different teams inside the firm are fighting for resources. Some who work in the more traditional, lower-fee parts of the business say that as private markets become more prominent at the firm, the rewards are going disproportionately to employees who work in that business, according to people familiar with their thinking. Related:iCapital, Tangible to Launch Digital Marketplace for Sale of Secondary Stakes Klar, one of three people who determines partner compensation, said this is not the case. If the privates business does well, then all the partners at Wellington benefit, he said. While most of Wellington’s assets are in privately held accounts, for which information isn’t available, data for its public funds offer a glimpse into the industry’s struggles. About 160 funds with combined assets of a half-trillion dollars managed or sub-advised by the firm recorded outflows of more than $130 billion between 2022 and the end of June 2025, according to Morningstar. Wellington’s growing hedge fund franchise, set up in the mid-1990s, now manages about $20 billion in long-short strategies. While that’s a tiny slice of the firm’s overall assets, it accounts for an outsize share of the firm’s profits. To attract and retain the talent needed to generate the above-market returns many alternative investment clients expect, the firm has also had to utilize other routes to a big payday besides its classic and lengthy path to becoming a partner. Alternative investment portfolio staffers are compensated in line with market standards, Klar said. For those deemed to have a big impact on the firm’s financial performance, there’s always the position of managing director — a role that allows staff to share in some of the profits without having been named partner. Wellington’s push into wealth is also forcing the firm to rethink another closely guarded aspect of its culture: its secrecy. For decades, the asset manager was so content with having a name known only among pensions and endowments that it made a point of not having a public profile. But Wellington often took its privacy to extremes. A former employee recalls that it was so hard to find information about the firm when he joined 20 years ago that he wasn’t sure it was a legitimate company until he had his first interview. People at bank wealth channels — which play a vital role in selling Wellington’s products to individuals — have said that everyday investors don’t know the firm and, for the funds to sell, the brand needs to be bigger. And so, Wellington has reluctantly begun hiring its first public relations people in recent years. It’s learning, slowly but surely, how to put itself out there. This isn’t the first time Wellington has had to reinvent itself. The firm, founded in 1928, faced an existential crisis 50 years ago after a disastrous run in equities nearly left it for dead. Its roughly two dozen partners at the time mortgaged their houses and used the money to delist the firm from the stock market. It later fired Jack Bogle, in 1974, after disagreements with Wellington partners over investment strategy and personnel matters. Bogle went on to found Vanguard, and Wellington agreed to run active strategies for his new outfit. Vanguard eventually became a household name synonymous with the 401(k) market, while Wellington built its brand with institutional clients and shunned the spotlight. In the ensuing years Wellington became less Boston-centric, opened offices and launched funds in Europe and Asia and abandoned a fixation on US equities to start investing in international stocks and, more recently, in bonds. (Today, about 40% of its assets are in fixed income.) As it looks to its next century, the firm is stretching further beyond the status quo. As part of its partnership with Blackstone and Vanguard, Wellington now oversees around 100 people globally working on the project. Terry Burgess, one of the firm’s top three decision makers, is in charge of the effort. Klar said that beyond courting retail investors, the firm’s alts expansion — and attracting talent for that business — is another reason Wellington wants its name out there. As it peddles its brand, Wellington now records podcasts, produces videos with weekly market updates, and churns out regular press releases. It’s a far cry for a firm that, until recently, never even had a publicist on the payroll.

September 05, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, confirms that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, officially broke ground on its $300 million Sunset Amphitheater on June 13, 2025, in McKinney, Texas. According to Founder, Chairman, and CEO J.W. Roth, the Sunset VENU will be “the most luxurious fully seated, multi-configuration, all-season venue in history.” The amphitheater will feature a canopied roof, wind walls, LuxeFire Suites, and a members-only Aikman Club, in collaboration with NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, Founder of EIGHT Elite Light Beer. Nestled at the center of the amphitheater, the Aikman Club offers one-of-a-kind views, premium seating, and high-end amenities. With a capacity of up to 20,000 guests, more than double the 8,000-seat Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, the Sunset Amphitheater is positioned as a premier destination for live entertainment. Institutional VIP Momentum Institutional investors have been quick to recognize VENU’s value creation. Over the last month: Analyst Support Strengthens the Story Wall Street coverage is building alongside institutional ownership. Cenorium Capital recently reiterated its Strong Buy rating with a $22 price target, while Northland Securities raised its target from $15 to $17, maintaining its Buy rating. Analysts point to VENU’s amphitheater model, accelerating municipal pipeline, and diversified funding approach as key drivers of long-term value. National Recognition & Strategic Partnerships VENU has been recognized nationally by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Denver Post, Billboard, VenuesNow, and Variety for its innovative and disruptive approach to live entertainment. Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders, such as AEG Presents, VENU continues to shape the future of the entertainment landscape. Municipalities are also lining up. Economic impact studies from the McKinney Sunset Amphitheater project, which is expected to generate over $3 billion in impact within the first decade, have catalyzed community interest nationwide. “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area,” said Roth. “To accelerate these agreements, we’ve partnered with industry leader Ryan, who is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter. On average, each delivered development agreement can add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet.” Growth Pipeline & Financial Catalysts “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund expansion—through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks of underlying land,” added Roth. “The future we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months.” Long-Term Vision By 2030, VENU plans to operate 25 amphitheaters and 15 indoor entertainment complexes, totaling 350,000+ seats. That scale translates to over 20 million annual tickets sold and more than $2 billion in gross ticket sales volume, cementing VENU as a leader in next-generation live entertainment.
