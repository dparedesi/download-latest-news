Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Unmanned Ground Vehicles Strategic Intelligence Report 2025: Expansion, M&A Activities, and R&D Initiatives are Crucial for Capitalizing on Emerging UGV Capabilities

October 03, 2025 05:52 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Unmanned Ground Vehicles" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report explores emergent trends within the UGV market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensors, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.UGVs are finally making a mark in modern warfare, and their use can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome developmental hurdles, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves public and private investment in the sector and constant experimentation in Ukraine.Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been a distant second thought for those thinking about the future of unmanned warfare. Indeed, Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), but until recently, UGVs have rarely been mentioned. Yet warfare drives innovation, and the UGV sector has been developed by Ukrainian fighters seeking to manage personnel shortages. Since the start of that war, the use of UGVs for logistical, engineering, surveillance, and combat support roles has exploded, and Ukraine now plans to deliver 15,000 ground robots for combat use by the end of 2025. While it is important to recognize that UGVs still account for a fraction of the total of unmanned support in conflicts, the utility of UGVs has at long last been exploited by those on the battlefield. Modern UGVs are now suitable for a wide variety of defense and security applications beyond the traditionally limited scope of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), with nations including China, France, India, Russia, the UK, and the US developing logistics, ISR, and combat-capable UGV platforms.To capitalize on the growth of the UGV market, key industry players have been investing heavily in expanding their research, development, and manufacturing capabilities, with both established defense primes like Rheinmetall and KMW as well as emerging players such as EDGE Group engaging in mergers and acquisitions of specialist firms within the UGV supply chain to pre-emptively secure market shares in an emerging capability sector. Firms with expertise in associated technologies such as AI, weapons systems, mobility solutions, and power supply/management will also benefit from growing demand as the diversified applications for UGVs provide new opportunities to engage with primes and forge strategic partnerships to cement their positions within the supply chain.Studies of emerging technological trends and their broader impact on the defense market.Analysis of the various unmanned ground vehicle programs and projects currently under development, as well as the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence on the future outlook of the unmanned ground vehicles theme.Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3bitvn About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: Czech Elections Could Shift Country Away From Pro-European Path, Impacting Support For Ukraine

By Rikard Jozwiak October 01, 2025 When Czech voters head to ballot boxes this weekend, many fear the country may turn away from its pro-European path, taking away one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters as its battle to repel invading Russian forces nears the four-year mark. Most polls indicate that billionaire Andrej Babis and his populist ANO party will win the parliamentary elections on October 3-4 with around 30 percent of the vote. That means Babis would have to form a coalition government with fringe parties, which would bring the country closer to Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia in terms of its outlook on Ukraine, potentially stopping aid for Kyiv and becoming less enthusiastic about Czech membership in Western institutions. While not in total alignment with Moscow's positions, Prague would become more vocal on the need to immediately stop the war and aim for peace -- most likely on the Kremlin's terms. Expect less harsh rhetoric toward China as well. Polling and political analyst Michael Ashcroft said in an analysis that the Czechs may join "what is from Kyiv's point of view a worrying trend in Central and Eastern Europe, with the existing stance of the Hungarian and Slovakian governments and the new Polish president much less inclined to defend Ukrainian sovereignty." "The consequences could include isolating Ukraine from Western European partners, disrupting military supplies and sowing further division in the alliance," he added. Just as it did in Moldova -- where elections last weekend saw a massive Russian disinformation campaign try and swing voters away from pro-Europe parties -- the Kremlin has been looking to take advantage of the waning support for aid to Ukraine that has helped fuel Babis's rise back to prominence. A Czech research group uncovered nearly 300 anonymous TikTok accounts aimed at amplifying pro-Russian narratives and backing radical parties in the final weeks of the election campaign. The Center For Research Into Online Risks said in a statement on September 28 that Czech TikTok accounts with millions of followers "are systematically spreading pro-Russian propaganda and support for anti-system parties through manipulated engagement." The center added that the accounts are not tied to a single political entity, instead "combining support for multiple anti-system parties simultaneously." "The cumulative reach of these accounts is 5 to 9 million views per week, more than the combined official accounts of the leaders of the largest Czech political parties on TikTok," it said. Analysts say the key thing to look out for now is which parties gain enough votes to enter parliament as Babis will likely need a coalition to govern. Spolu (Together), an alliance of center-right parties that includes the incumbent Prime Minister Petr Fiala's Civic Democrats is polling at around 20 percent, whereas the other parties of the current pro-Western coalition government Stan (Mayors and Independents) and the Pirates are predicted to end up with 10-12 percent each. All of these parties have said that they aren't interested in entering a coalition with ANO or even backing it with votes to pass legislation as a single-party minority government. But this is preelection talk and the tune could very well change after the vote, especially amid growing fears that more radical coalition alternatives could derail the Czech Republic's pro-Western course. As junior coalition partners, they could demand key posts in the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. Secondly, there are factions in the current government, notably in the Civic Democrats, that share ANO's political positions -- committed to NATO but weaker on EU membership and opposed to euro adoption and Brussels policies such as mandatory refugee quotas and the green deal. But the Central European country could also change radically if Babis teams up with any of the current opposition parties that are even more radical than the ANO. These include the far-right SPD, polling above 10 percent, as well as a smaller far-right outfit AUTO (Motorists for themselves) and the far-left Stacilo (Enough), both of which are expected to clear the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Governing with any of them would likely lead to a real rapprochement with Orban and Fico, both of whom have been critical of aid to Ukraine and are also in the vanguard of countries in Europe that continue to purchase Russian oil and natural gas despite Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A key figure in whatever comes after the election is pro-Western President Petr Pavel, who plays a role in government formation as well as foreign policy in general. Pavel, a former senior NATO general, has made it clear that he won't allow a government that strays too far from the Western course. Babis has been a constant fixture of Czech politics for the last 15 years, first serving as finance minister and deputy prime minister before leading the country from 2017 to 2021, as well as attempting to become president only to be trounced by Pavel in the 2023 election. One of the country's richest people, with considerable stakes in agribusiness and media, his time in the public spotlight has been dogged by legal disputes and accusations of conflicts of interest and EU subsidy fraud. Yet, it's also his business interests that many believe could keep him, and by extension the Czech Republic, anchored in the West as good relations between the Czech Republic and France, Germany, and Austria as well as the continued flow of EU agriculture and cohesion funds are more important than anything Beijing and Moscow can offer. Babis has chartered a more populist course in recent years and was one of the creators of the biggest populist forces on the continent, Patriots for Europe, a political family also consisting of Orban's Fidesz, Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Spain's Vox, and Austria's Freedom party. He has also voiced support for Fico's Smer party even though they are not formally part of the Patriots for Europe alliance. Rallying against all things Brussels, environmentalism, and immigration, they would also find sympathetic ears beyond Central Europe with right-wing populists of various hues on the rise or in power in many other Western capitals as well.

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Meanwhile, the White House, under President Donald Trump, has orchestrated a crypto push and hedge funds, pensions and banks have lavished capital into these and similar types of products.

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. The decision is a potential watershed moment for US money managers, more than 70 of which have sought permission from the SEC to adopt the dual-class structure. ETFs have become the investment vehicle of choice for Americans over the last decade thanks to their favorable tax status and ease of use. They’ve attracted trillions of dollars in inflows while mutual funds bled assets.

A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs. In 2024, mutual funds shed a net $451 billion, while their exchange-traded counterparts — which typically offer superior tax efficiency and liquidity — took in a record $1.1 trillion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that the SEC has signed off, the real work will begin. There’s matters of logistics, economics and the economics of logistics to attend to and it will likely be years before we see ETF share classes proliferate and become broadly and easily accessible via conversions of existing mutual fund share class holdings,” said Morningstar’s Ben Johnson.
