ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. When American Eagle (AEO) launched its jeans campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney, the initial reaction was largely critical, with skeptics finding something to criticize at every opportunity. Yet, like the adage, no publicity is bad publicity, as the results speak for themselves. The collaboration, initially labeled as “controversial”, delivered a significant uplift in American Eagle’s sales, driving the stock up more than 35% in a single trading day. What began as skepticism became a clear example of how strategic brand initiatives can translate into meaningful shareholder value. In an increasingly discerning market, companies with strong businesses get rewarded. By leveraging my AI Agent for investing, I take it a step further by identifying quality companies that also have good stocks, and I highlight the best of those stocks in my Long Idea reports. My Long Idea this week features a company that benefits from strong macro tailwinds in its industry, has a low-cost advantage driven by its superior technology, and, best of all, its stock price looks cheap. With the rise in e-brokerages, access to capital markets and investing has never been greater. The clear winners, apart from investors, are the brokerage companies themselves. This e-brokerage company has a unique market leader position and is poised to capitalize on growth for years to come. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is this week’s Long Idea. We first unveiled IBKR as a Super Stock in September 2024. Super Stocks offer a very rare combination of qualities. They (1) earn a Very Attractive rating and (2) have businesses that generate economic earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Most importantly, Super Stocks outperform. For example, IBKR is up an impressive 110%+, compared to the S&P 500 rising 18%, since I unveiled it as a Super Stock. Even after this strong outperformance, IBKR looks undervalued and offers further upside potential. Rising retail investor participation, enabled by accessible and low-cost trading models, has reshaped the investment landscape. Technological innovation also plays a key role: mobile-first platforms with intuitive, gamified features attract new investors, while advanced tools that automate and accelerate processes support more experienced market participants and institutions. At the same time, consumer preferences are shifting decisively toward digital platforms that are easy to use, affordable, and highly automated, which positions the market for sustained expansion. Research and Markets forecasts the e-brokerage market will grow from $14.1 billion in 2024 to $34.6 billion in 2034, a CAGR of 9.4%. Figure 1: E-Brokerage Market Growth Forecast: 2024 – 2034 The Covid-19 pandemic marked a significant inflection point in retail investor activity. With increased time at home, limited alternative investment outlets, and heightened market volatility, millions of individuals turned to e-brokerage platforms as a primary means of accessing financial markets. At the time, market analysts thought the trend might prove transitory, but evidence indicates that retail stock trading has not only persisted but continues to grow. The accessibility of low-cost trading platforms, the democratization of financial information through digital channels, and a generational shift toward active investing have all contributed to sustained growth. So far in 2025, retail investors account for approximately 21% of daily trading volume on the Nasdaq, compared to just 10% in 2020. This trend serves as one of the primary tailwinds behind the expansion of the e-brokerage market. Looking ahead, demographic factors further support an upward trajectory. Younger cohorts, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are entering their peak income and savings years with a stronger predisposition toward direct market engagement and are more technologically savvy than previous generations. The growing interest of younger generations in capital markets is likely to benefit retail-focused, entry-level investment platforms, such as Robinhood (HOOD) and Webull (BULL), given their emphasis on simplicity and accessibility. However, as these investors gain experience and develop a deeper understanding of market strategies, their preferences are likely to shift toward platforms that provide more advanced tools and sophisticated capabilities, such as Interactive Brokers. Interactive Brokers is capitalizing on the macro tailwinds buffeting its industry. The company’s customer equity (the total value of all assets held by customers) increased 26% compounded annually over the last decade, from $56.7 billion in 2014 to $664.6 billion in 2Q25. Interactive Brokers ability to grow customer equity comes not only from rising account balances of existing users, but also attracting new users. The company’s total accounts grew from 281 thousand in 2014 to 3.9 million at the end of 2Q25. The total accounts grew 37% and 28% compounded annually over the last 5- and 10-years, respectively. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Interactive Brokers’ Total Accounts: 2014 – 2Q25 As a result, the company’s total customer daily average revenue trades (DARTs) increased from 564 thousand in 2014 to 3.6 million at the end of 2Q25. More importantly, Interactive Brokers’ total executed order volumes increased from 289 million in 2014 to 346 million in 2019 to 725 million in 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, total executed order volumes reached 488 million. Should trade volumes maintain at this rate, the company would execute 976 million orders in 2025, which would be 6% higher than 2024. See Figure 3. Of note, in 2024, the company’s total trade volumes surpassed the previous high set in 2020, when meme-stock activity drove record volumes. Figure 3: Interactive Brokers’ Total Executed Trade Volumes: 2014 – Annualized 2025 A big driver of Interactive Broker’s strong growth is superior offerings. Interactive Brokers is recognized as one of the industry leaders for its superior pricing, extensive international coverage, wide array of advanced trading tools, and advanced automation. Interactive Brokers was rated #1 in: In the next three sections, I dive into details on the advantages that Interactive Brokers’ superior offerings give its customers. Interactive Brokers leverages its proprietary technology to automate the entirety of the transaction lifecycle, which includes account opening, order routing, real-time risk management, securities lending, and regulatory spending. In fact, the majority of the company’s senior management are software engineers, which explains the success and focus on automating as many brokerage processes as possible. The company’s industry-leading automation enables it to run a low fixed cost and high margin business. One could argue that, historically, traditional brokerages are against automation, because more client interaction and touch points created more ways to deepen relationships and generate fees for manually performing tasks. Interactive Brokers took another route and made a big bet on automation. Now the firm is well-positioned to meet the demands and preferences of an increasingly experienced retail trader that prioritizes automation and low costs. I think Interactive Brokers’ bet on automation will continue to pay off for the company and its investors. Perhaps, most impressive about all this automation is that it supports one of the most sophisticated and flexible investing platforms in the world. Experienced investors consistently choose Interactive Brokers over its competitors because it offers 100+ order types (from limit orders to complex algorithmic trading), prime brokerage services, comprehensive reporting tools, and much more to enhance the investors’ experience. Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rates are significantly less than its main competitors, while its interest rate offered on cash balances over $10K is higher. Per Figure 3, Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rate for $25K borrowing is 5.8%, which is significantly lower than the 12.1%, 12.1%, 12.3%, and 12.7% offered by Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, and E-Trade, respectively. Figure 4: Interactive Brokers’ Margin Loan Rates vs Competitors as of June 2025 Interactive Brokers facilitates investing and trading on more countries and currencies compared to competitors. The company offers its financial products in 36 countries and 28 currencies, compared to Fidelity’s 25 countries and 16 currencies and Schwab’s 12 countries and 8 currencies. Although Interactive Brokers’ clientele is largely sophisticated/high level investors, the company keeps the pipeline of new clients loaded by attracting retail investors with streamlined solutions for beginners. In fact, the company even offers comprehensive education (IBKR Campus) courses, videos, and webinars for beginners on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, options trading, fixed income assets, as well as paper trading tools where investors can practice without using/risking real money. IBKR Campus offers a wider variety of education compared to Robinhood’s education offering, Robinhood Learn. Figure 5: IBKR Campus and Robinhood learn Education Offerings Comparison While growing customer accounts, volumes, and assets, Interactive Brokers has also grown its top- and bottom-line. The company has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 23% and 22% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 6. The company’s NOPAT margin fell slightly from 42% in 2014 to 39% in the TTM, while its invested capital turns rose from 0.2 to 0.6 over the same time. Rising invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 9% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM. Additionally, Interactive Brokers’ Core Earnings, a cleaner version of earnings, grew from $45 million in 2014 to $838 million in the TTM, or 32% compounded annually. Figure 6: Interactive Brokers’ Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 On top of being recognized as the best in the industry across multiple categories, Interactive Brokers is also the most profitable brokerage company among publicly-traded competitors. Interactive Brokers has the highest ROIC and the second highest NOPAT margin among publicly traded peers, which include Robinhood (HOOD), eToro (ETOR), JPMorgan (JPM), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and more. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Interactive Brokers’ Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Interactive Brokers does return capital to shareholders through dividends, though the yield is minimal. Since 2019, Interactive Brokers has paid $337 million (1% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.03/share in 1Q19 to $0.08/share in calendar 3Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.5% yield. The company hasn’t repurchased any shares over the same time and hasn’t mentioned anything about starting to repurchase shares. Interactive Brokers consistently generates high free cash flow (FCF). Per Figure 8, From 2019 through the first half of 2025, the company generated $2.7 billion in FCF, which equals 6% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 8: Interactive Brokers’ Cumulative FCF: 2019 – 1H25 Interactive Brokers has the capital strength to weather any uncertainty in the foreseeable future. The company earns a Very Attractive overall Credit Rating and scores an Attractive-or-better rating for all five credit rating criteria. See Figure 9. Figure 9: Interactive Brokers’ Credit Rating Details Trade volumes are critical for brokerage companies, so bear markets present unique challenges, more so than short-term volatility. Analyzing how Interactive Brokers handled prior down markets (2022 and 2008 for instance) gives me an idea of how they might handle one in the future. First, I note that Interactive Brokers remained profitable in both 2008 and 2022, even as the market took a turn for the worst. How did the company remain profitable while other firms hemorrhaged cash? The company is well-positioned to take market share from big brokers like Schwab and Fidelity due to its lower fees and margin loan rates. Should economic conditions deteriorate, investors and hedge funds, will gravitate towards lower cost offerings, and IBKR offers the lowest. Lastly, Interactive Brokers’ large asset base provides ample opportunity, throughout nearly all market cycles. At its current price of $64/share, IBKR has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s NOPAT to never grow from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic considering Interactive Brokers has grown NOPAT by 25%, 22% and 14% compounded annually over the past 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for IBKR. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: IBKR would be worth $64/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT would grow just 3% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth at least $91/share today – a 42% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT grows just 5% compounded annually from 2025 through 2034. Should Interactive Brokers grow profits grow more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 10 compares the company’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios. Figure 10: Interactive Brokers’ Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Here’s a summary of why I think the moat around Interactive Brokers’ business will enable it to continue to generate higher NOPAT than the current market valuation implies: These days, fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder-aligned corporate governance. Due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus is on short-term technical trading trends while more reliable fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary of what noise traders are missing: Interactive Brokers has beaten earnings estimates in 4 of the past 10 quarters, so doing so more consistently could send shares higher. Also, the company’s consistent top- and bottom-line growth help explain IBKR outperforming the overall Financial sector since the beginning of this year. Year-to-date, IBKR is up 36% while the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up just 12%. More consistent earnings beats could send shares even higher and further extend the stock’s outperformance. Interactive Brokers’ executives receive performance awards based on three criteria: pre-tax income, adjusted pre-tax profit margin, and three-year adjusted net revenue growth. We would prefer the company tie executive compensation to ROIC. Doing so ensures that executives’ interests are more aligned with shareholders’ interests as there is a strong correlation between improving ROIC and increasing shareholder value. Improving ROIC requires attention to all areas of the business, so including it in an executive compensation plan would incentivize executives to improve the entire business, not just one sales goal or earnings number. Despite using adjusted pre-tax income and revenue growth goals in its executive pay, Interactive Brokers’ management has grown economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, 30% compounded annually over the last decade, from $141 million in 2014 to $2.3 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25. Over the past twelve months, insiders have purchased 1.7 million shares and sold 1.1 million shares for a net effect of 604,581 shares bought. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding. There are currently 10.0 million shares sold short, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and two days to cover. The following funds receive an Attractive-or-better rating and allocate significantly to IBKR:

AWS Blogs Are you modernizing your legacy batch processing systems? At Vanguard, we faced significant challenges with our legacy mainframe system that limited our ability to deliver modern, personalized customer experiences. Our centralized database architecture created performance bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale services independently for our millions of personal and institutional investors. In this post, we show you how we modernized our data architecture using Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). You’ll learn how we transitioned to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture while preserving critical batch processing capabilities. We show you how this solution enabled us to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining cross-domain analytics capabilities—all while adhering to the principles of bounded contexts and distributed data ownership. Background and challenges As financial needs continue to evolve, Vanguard is committed to delivering adaptable, top-notch experiences that foster long-lasting customer relationships. This commitment spans from enhancing the personal investor journey to bringing personalized mobile dashboards and connecting institutional clients with advanced advice offerings. To elevate customer experience and drive digital transformation, Vanguard has embraced domain-driven design principles. This approach focuses on creating autonomous teams, fostering faster innovation, and building data mesh architecture. Central to this transformation is the Personal Investor team’s mainframe modernization effort, transitioning from a legacy system to a cloud-based, distributed data architecture organized around bounded contexts – distinct business domains that manage their own data. As part of this shift, each microservice now manages its own local data store using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition or Amazon DynamoDB. This approach enables domain-level data ownership and operational autonomy. Vanguard’s existing mainframe system, built on a centralized Db2 database, enables cross-domain data access and integration but also introduces several architectural challenges. Though batch processes can join data across multiple bounded contexts using SQL joins and database operations to integrate information from various sources, this tight coupling creates significant risks and operational issues. Challenges with the centralized database approach include: To address these architectural challenges, we chose to use Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). The Amazon Redshift architecture has compute and storage separation, which enables us to create multi-cluster architectures with a separate endpoint for each domain with independent scaling of compute and storage resources. Our solution leverages the data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining the ability to perform cross-domain analytics when needed. Key benefits of the Amazon Redshift solution include: Let’s explore the different solutions we evaluated before selecting ORDS with Amazon Redshift as our optimal approach. We implemented ORDS as our optimal solution after conducting a comprehensive evaluation of available options. This section outlines our decision-making process and examines the alternatives we considered during our assessment. Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS): In our evaluation, we found that using Amazon Redshift for ORDS provides a powerful solution for handling data across different business areas. It excels at managing large volumes of data from multiple sources, providing fast access to replicated data for batch processes that require cross-bounded context data, and combining information using familiar SQL queries. The solution particularly shines in handling high-volume reads from our data sources. Advantages: Disadvantages: Here are the other solutions we evaluated: Bulk APIs: We found that Bulk APIs provides an approach for handling large volumes of data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While Bulk APIs offer powerful capabilities, we found they require substantial team coordination and careful implementation to be effective. Data Lake: Our evaluation showed that data lakes can effectively combine information from different parts of our business. They excel at processing large amounts of data at once, providing search capabilities through unified data formats, and managing large volumes of diverse and complex data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While data lakes excel at big-picture analysis of large datasets, they weren’t optimal for our real-time data needs and complex data relationships. S3 Export/Exchange: In our analysis, we found that S3 Export/Exchange provides a method for sharing data between different business areas using file storage. This approach effectively handles large volumes of data and allows straightforward filtering of information using data frames. Advantages: Disadvantages: While S3 Export/Exchange works well for sharing large datasets between teams, it didn’t meet our requirements for quick, real-time access or immediately usable data formats. The following table provides a high-level comparison of the different data integration solutions we considered for our modernization efforts. It outlines where each solution is most appropriate to use and when it might not be the best choice: Fetching specific data subsets Many bounded context Large volume batch processing Point-in-time export is sufficient Structured, transactional data processing Many bounded contexts Table 1: Data Integration Solutions Comparison Based on our comparison, we found ORDS to be the optimal solution for our needs, particularly when our batch processes require access to data from multiple bounded contexts in real-time. Our implementation efficiently handles large volumes of data, significantly improving the performance of our batch jobs. We chose ORDS because it stores data in a familiar table format, accessible via SQL, making it simple and efficient for our teams to use. The architecture also aligns with our domain-driven design principles by enforcing clear data ownership, where each bounded context maintains responsibility for its own data management. This approach provides us with both scalability and reliability, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Amazon Redshift serves as the backbone of our ORDS implementation, offering several crucial features that support our modernization goals: Data Sharing Our solution leveraged the robust data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift, available on both Server-based Redshift RA3 instances and Redshift Serverless options. This functionality provided us with instant, secure, and live data access without copies, maintaining transactional consistency across our environment. The flexibility of same account, cross-account, and cross-Region data sharing has been particularly valuable for our distributed architecture. High Performance We’ve achieved significant performance improvements through Amazon Redshift’s efficient query processing and data retrieval capabilities. The system effectively handles our complex data needs while maintaining robust performance across various workloads and data volumes. Multi-Availability Zone Support Our implementation benefited from Amazon Redshift’s Multi-AZ support, which maintains high availability and reliability for our critical operations. This feature minimizes downtime without requiring extensive setup and significantly reduces our risk of data loss. Familiar Interface The relational environment of Amazon Redshift, similar traditional databases like Amazon RDS and IBM Db2, has enabled a smooth transition for our teams. This familiarity has accelerated adoption and improved productivity, as our teams can leverage their existing SQL expertise. By centralizing data from multiple business areas in ORDS using Amazon Redshift, we maintain consistent, efficient, and secure data access across our product teams. This setup is particularly valuable for our batch processing that requires data from various parts of the business, offering us a blend of performance, reliability, and ease of use. Here’s how our ORDS architecture implements Amazon Redshift data sharing to solve these challenges: Figure 1: Vanguard’s ORDS Architecture using Amazon Redshift Data Sharing Amazon Redshift Ingestion Pattern: We utilized Amazon Redshift’s zero-ETL functionality to integrate data and enable real-time analytics directly on operational data, which helped reduce complexity and maintenance overhead. To complement this capability and to fulfill our comprehensive compliance requirements that necessitate complete transaction replication, we implemented additional data ingestion pipelines. Our data ingestion strategy for Amazon Redshift employs different AWS services depending on the source. For Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL databases, we use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to directly replicate data into Amazon Redshift. For data from Amazon DynamoDB, we leverage Amazon Kinesis to stream the data into Amazon Redshift, where it lands in materialized views. These views are then further processed to generate tables for end-users. This approach allows us to efficiently ingest data from our operational data stores while meeting both analytical needs and compliance requirements. Amazon Redshift Data Sharing: We used the Amazon Redshift’s data sharing feature to effectively decouple our data producers from consumers, allowing each group to operate within their own boundaries while maintaining a unified and simplified governed mechanism for data sharing. Our implementation followed a clear process: once data is ingested and available in Amazon Redshift table format, we created views for consumers to access the data. We then established data shares and granted access to these views to consumer Amazon Redshift data warehouses for batch processing. In our environment with multiple bounded contexts, we’ve established a collaborative model where consumers work with various producer teams to access data from different data shares, each created per bounded context. This access remained strictly read-only—when consumers need to update or write new data that falls outside their bounded context, they must use APIs or other designated mechanisms for such operations. This approach has proven effective for our organization, promoting clear data ownership and governance while enabling flexible data access across organizational boundaries. It simplified our data management and made sure each team can operate independently while still sharing data effectively. Disclaimer: This is provided for reference purposes only and does not represent a real example. Let’s look at a practical example: our brokerage account statement generation process. This cross-bounded context batch process requires integrating data from multiple sources, accessing hundreds of tables and processing large volumes of data monthly. The challenge was to create an efficient, cost-effective solution that minimizes data replication while maintaining data accessibility.ORDS proved ideal for this use case, as it provides data from multiple bounded contexts without replication, offers near real-time access, and enables straightforward data aggregation using SQL-like queries in Amazon Redshift. The following diagram shows how we implemented this solution: Figure 2: Cross-Bounded Context Example for Brokerage Account Statement Generation We need the following bounded contexts to generate brokerage statements for millions of our clients. Through this architecture, we efficiently generate accurate and comprehensive brokerage account statements by consolidating data from these bounded contexts, meeting both our clients’ needs and regulatory requirements. Our journey with the Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) and Amazon Redshift has enhanced our client experience (CX) through improved data management and accessibility. By transitioning from our mainframe system to a cloud-based, domain-driven architecture, we have empowered our autonomous teams and established a resilient batch architecture. This shift facilitates efficient cross-domain data access, maintains high-quality data consistency, and provides scalability. Our ORDS implementation, supported by Amazon Redshift, offers near-real-time access to large data volumes, guaranteeing high performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. This modernization effort aligns with our mission to deliver exceptional, personalized client experiences and sustain long-lasting client relationships. If you are facing similar challenges with your batch processing systems, we encourage you to explore how an Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) can transform your data architecture. Start by assessing your current system’s limitations and identifying opportunities for improvement through domain-driven design and cloud-based solutions. Consider how this approach can help you manage large volumes of data from multiple sources, provide fast access to replicated data for batch processes, and support high-volume reads from various data sources. Take the next step by conducting a proof of concept (POC) to evaluate ORDS effectiveness in achieving efficient cross-domain data access, improving the performance of batch jobs, and maintaining clear data ownership within your business domains. By implementing this solution, you can enhance your data management capabilities, reduce operational risks, and drive innovation within your organization. Embrace this opportunity to elevate your data architecture and deliver exceptional customer experiences. Our transition to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture with ORDS using Amazon Redshift has successfully transformed our batch processing capabilities in AWS cloud. This modernization effort has significantly enhanced the performance, reliability, and scalability of our batch operations while maintaining seamless data access and integration across different business domains. The strategic adoption of ORDS has harnessed the potential of cross-domain data access in a distributed environment, providing us with a robust solution for real-time data access and efficient batch processing. This transformation has empowered us to better meet the demands of the digital age, delivering superior customer experiences and reinforcing our commitment to innovation in the financial services industry.
