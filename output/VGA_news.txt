You can easily get a sample PDF of the report - https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00021800 Factors driving this growth include growing incidence and use of nematicides for crop protection and yield improvements, increasing prevalence of nematodes, and the expansion of organic farming and biological nematicides. More advanced formulations of nematicides, such as bio-based and targeted chemical alternatives, are now providing new solutions for nematode control, allowing sustainable agricultural practice and advancements for improved crop yields. Opportunities for the future market lie in overall technological advancements, eco-friendly solutions, and increased adoption of integrated pest management products, and the movement toward precision agriculture, making nematicides an integral part of modern crop protection and food security. Increasing Use of Nematicides for Crop Protection and Yield Improvement As agriculture becomes more intense and widespread, monoculture grows, nematode pressure increases, encouraging more chemical and biological nematicides use as first-line protection. Farmers across the globe are adopting nematicides as a part of their integrated crop management system to protect their yields and gain profit. The difference between treated and untreated plots is perfectly evident in high nematode environments. Research in South Africa from the National Library of Medicine, conducted from 2005 to 2011, reported average yield increases of 34% for the nematicide treatments, with yield increases as high as 367% in heavily nematode-affected soils. This research demonstrates the impact of the nematicide on growers as a critical input in commercial operations and smaller-scale farmers, divorcing all while government impacts over older products, such as Telone, produce a succession of re-regulatory measures in the near future. The United Nations approximates global population growth by nearly 2 billion during the next thirty years, from 8 billion in 2022 to 9.7 billion in 2050, and will peak in 2100 at nearly 10.4 billion. With a rise in the global population and the demand for food, agriculturists worldwide are focusing on modifying farming practices to obtain high crop yields from smaller cultivation areas. Consequently, increasing crop yields and ensuring they are protected properly is a top priority within agriculture, emphasizing the ongoing need for nematicides. The use of nematicides is not only reserved for global staple crops like corn, wheat, and rice. Farmers growing fruits, vegetables, cotton, and specialty crops rely on nematicides to produce a quality product with a profitable yield. Nematicides, particularly the newer bio-based products and reduced-risk nematicides, have gotten higher marks for effectiveness because they can target multiple nematode species and support environmental sustainability. As regulatory agencies are keener to enforce rules on traditional pesticides, there are opportunities to offer nematicides that are safer, more targeted products, and have little off-target and residual issues. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs also improve the utility of nematicides. Growers combine nematicides with improving practices such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, and soil health practices to build a more resilient farming system. Increased education and outreach efforts through agricultural associations and universities have raised awareness about nematodes, identification, and control, and have created even more demand for more modern nematicides. Surging Prevalence of Nematodes Drives Nematicides Market Growth As plant breeders and researchers incorporate natural or engineered resistance genes into important crops, growers depend on varieties that can withstand nematode attack without chemical treatment. This shift reduces reliance on nematicides, especially in regions or crop sectors where such resistance is highly effective and sustainable. The proliferation of nematode-resistant cultivars has been particularly transformative in several crops. Introducing the Mi gene from wild tomato into commercial tomato varieties delivers strong resistance to multiple root-knot nematode species. It has allowed large-scale tomato growers—especially in North Carolina, where up to 97% of the tobacco crop is planted using varieties resistant to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)—to reduce or even eliminate nematicide use. Likewise, resistance genes in potato, soybean, and sugar beet reduce the need for nematicides by providing the plants with natural protection from cyst nematodes and other important pests. However, there are challenges regarding consistently using resistant cultivars. The use of resistance genes does put selection pressure on nematode populations, leading to some risk of cows emerging with resistance genes that once worked, especially certain cyst nematodes of potato and soybean crops. Regardless, the bottom line is this: resistance shifts and farm markets move to using resistant varieties, and nematicide sales become stable or decrease in those crops. For instance, after the broad adoption of cyst nematode-resistant soybean varieties in the US, the use of nematicides in soybean diminished drastically. Similar patterns are seen in other crops. These crop advancements make nematicides less central to integrated pest management, especially where resistance is durable and widely deployed.

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas. Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week. In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year. We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands. The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Certified applications: 2,440 Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025 The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director. Certified applications: 1,575 Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals.

Certified applications: 673 Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors. Certified applications: 624 Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing. Certified applications: 457 Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024 The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities "exotic" trader.
