Supermax Corporation Berhad's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of Supermax Corporation Berhad (KLSE:SUPERMX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 46% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private companies make up 41% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Supermax Corporation Berhad, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Supermax Corporation Berhad Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Supermax Corporation Berhad. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Supermax Corporation Berhad's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Supermax Corporation Berhad. The company's largest shareholder is Supermax Holdings Sdn Bhd, with ownership of 41%. With 3.0% and 2.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Hong Leong Asset Management Bhd. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Supermax Corporation Berhad. It has a market capitalization of just RM2.2b, and insiders have RM89m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 41%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with MGE Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Title: FEMA contracts out its home inspection services to…BlackRock…and a front company?

Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access. First of all, we need to consider the implications of home inspectors, employed in part by BlackRock and Vanguard investments, surveying the damage and assessing the value of hurricane-stricken North Carolina—especially because of the vast lithium deposits in the ground beneath and around these private properties. According to Straits Research, a major market analyst, the demand for lithium is going to explode over the next few years: The global lithium market size was valued at USD 38.2 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of USD 230.4 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 22.1% during the forecast period (2023-2031). This is a more than 500% increase in less than a decade. Here’s this, from a report less than two weeks ago; Albemarle, a major lithium producer, is pursuing lithium production in North Carolina. Earlier this year, it announced plans to reopen the resource-rich lithium Kings Mountain mine in the state by the end of 2026, supported by $150 million in DoE funding. However, it has faced backlash from environmentalists and indigenous groups looking to block the development, which has led to delays. Albemarle is looking to expand its domestic lithium production. And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain.

Title: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?

The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a "buy" or "strong buy" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.
