Advances in technology have introduced revolutionary process and service upgrades for businesses in recent years. Digital tools have enabled remote work and global hiring, streamlined (and sometimes taken over) repetitive processes, improved customer service and outreach, and more. However, progress often comes with pain points, and the growing use of technology in business has raised some serious security, social, ethical and sustainability concerns. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council reflect on some of the downsides of the digital era they’ve observed, as well as why it’s essential to acknowledge and address these issues. The growing use of artificial intelligence is causing a drastic increase in data center power consumption, straining traditional infrastructure and contributing to environmental peril. However, data centers that adopt distributed energy solutions like microgrids can mitigate these issues with localized, sustainable and scalable power, ensuring they remain resilient and energy-efficient in the face of rising AI demands. - Ravi Prasher, Bloom Energy The increasing reliance on technology has notably shortened the attention span of today’s workforce. Establishing dedicated “focus time,” when we deliberately avoid using our devices, can help. Additionally, silencing phones, minimizing nonessential notifications and creating tech-free zones are effective strategies to combat distractions and boost productivity in an ever-connected world. - Batul Bohara, Amazon.com Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? In the race to leverage transformative technologies, it can be easy to lose sight of the critical role only humans can play in the outcomes they deliver. Embracing today’s powerful technologies requires managing the risks they bring, and organizations that rank empathy, critical thinking and creativity among the workforce skills they value will have an edge in meeting these challenges. - Merav Yuravlivker, Data Society Like many, I see the issues with all things related to security, but another big problem is the loss of focus on critical thinking and individual creativity. The rapid evolution of AI has created a vast number of use cases, but that shouldn’t result in the elimination of individual thought. Combining the power of AI technology with experiential human knowledge and creative thought creates more robust solutions more quickly. Foster an environment that embraces combining the power of creative thought with the power of technology. - Johanna Baum, S3 Consulting Business data doubles almost every three years due to advanced technology. The concern is where to go from here. Do we let the data explosion continue freely? There are technologies that can actively delete data and files based on document retention policies and regulations. Such services not only help us manage the volume of data being stored, but can also protect corporations from unnecessary risks in the future. - Kazuhiro Gomi, NTT Research One negative impact of technology’s growth in business is the rise of job displacement due to automation. To address this, companies can invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, empowering workers to adapt to new roles and technologies. This fosters career growth alongside tech advancements. - Tina Gada, Vanguard Group Despite investing billions in software and point solutions, organizations in complex industries (like construction and manufacturing) are plagued by disconnected systems and data. A “one size fits all” approach to technology doesn’t work; instead, look for simple, custom-fit solutions capable of solving problems in a single platform, unlocking the potential of every employee to make an impact. - Ed Jennings, Quickbase The breadth of software modern workers need to get their jobs done and the siloed nature of teams makes IT sprawl a very real problem, contributing to sunken costs and security risks. One way to mitigate this is to look for and choose solutions within your existing business platform. This approach can help organizations better manage identity security, ensuring people have only the access they need to get their work done. - John Milburn, Clear Skye One negative impact of growing tech use is the rise in electronic waste, as businesses frequently upgrade devices. To address this, companies can implement e-waste recycling programs and invest in longer-lasting, repairable technology. Promoting a circular economy reduces environmental harm while fostering a more sustainable tech life cycle. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group One negative impact of growing technology use in business is the rise of employee burnout due to constant connectivity and blurred work-life boundaries. To address this, companies can implement “digital wellness” policies, such as enforcing regular breaks, setting boundaries on after-hours communication and promoting time off to ensure employees can disconnect and recharge effectively. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The digital divide creates a stark gap between those with access to technology and those without, deepening socioeconomic inequalities. Rural areas and low-income communities often face limited access to high-speed internet, devices and digital literacy. To bridge this divide, we must invest in infrastructure, affordable access and education, ensuring equitable opportunities in a rapidly digitizing world. - Vamsi Krishna Dhakshinadhi, GrabAgile Inc. Messaging on Slack and meeting online is undeniably convenient, but I also think it’s overused. As a leader, when I can, I like to meet in person, pick up the phone or use a means of connecting that is even just one degree more “human.” We talk a lot about creating human-centered software, but we can also choose to do without the software and just be human. - Lindsey Witmer Collins, WLCM “Welcome” App Studio As businesses digitize, a key issue is data privacy. The vast amount of personal information collected increases the risk of breaches. To address this, companies should implement privacy-by-design frameworks, encrypt sensitive data and promote transparency in how data is used. This builds customer trust while ensuring compliance with evolving data protection regulations. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech One negative impact of growing technology use is the rise in algorithmic bias, where AI systems unintentionally perpetuate social biases in decision making, from hiring to credit approval. To mitigate this, businesses should implement continuous bias audits and develop explainable AI frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness, while involving diverse teams in the AI development process. - Andrii Kovalchuk, WeSoftYou Inc. A negative impact from the rise of generative AI is that people are accepting its outputs as truth, without question. It’s not always the case that GenAI’s responses are correct. Generative AI creates an answer instead of looking for one—it will sometimes create incorrect answers, and people should be aware of that. - Gonçalo Ribeiro, YData In my sector (public health), many experienced health workers are not tech-savvy. Adding technology tools can help community-based organizations sustainably grow, but for many community health workers, the transition is not easy. It’s difficult but essential to strike a balance between opportunity and sustainable social change. - Syam Adusumilli, GroundGame Health Data intolerance is growing in businesses. Have you ever tried to search an organization’s website for useful information? Good luck. The chronic lack of searchable data strangles productivity, stifles creativity and foments employee burnout. Answers aren’t as simple as “you know, AI” or “get search.” Unbreaking search requires careful, policy-based data planning, executive buy-in and deep technical talent. - James Stanger, CompTIA One downside of the growing use of technology in business is that people tend to become too dependent on it. This makes companies vulnerable when their systems fail or they’re hit with cyberattacks. To minimize risk, businesses should develop effective backup plans, diversify their tech tools to avoid reliance on a single system, and regularly train employees to handle unexpected issues. - Sergii Malomuzh, Rewump

Title: Dixie D’Amelio, LaQuan Smith, Reed Krakoff and Others Toasted at FGI’s ‘Night of Stars’

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The Fashion Group International held its 40th annual gala at The Plaza hotel. Senior Editor With all of the slick runway shows, big-name designers and highly polished boutiques, fashion can appear to be all glamour, but working in the industry takes fortitude — and time. That was a recurring message from several of the award winners at the Fashion Group International‘s “Night of Stars” at The Plaza hotel Tuesday night. It was also suitable considering that the event was marking a 40-year anniversary — no small feat given New York City’s busy fall social calendar. Even when welcoming guests, Zac Posen and Coco Rocha, (who were the evening’s honorary chairs with Richard Dickson), touched upon the tests of time in their friendship and careers. Posen joked that he had become a FGI “Rising Star” award winner in 1800. And Rocha showed off his current agility — an evening gown made of Gap icon denim jackets. Posen, Gap Inc.’s newly installed executive vice president and creative director, quickly turned the spotlight onto the honorees, saying, “Tonight we are here to celebrate you. You have elevated our craft to new heights. You are the true stars tonight, and we applaud your remarkable contributions.” Related Articles Beauty Features Beauty's Leading Female Scientists Talk Innovation, Experimentation and Representation From The Newsroom Jane Lauder Shares a Journey of Innovation and Legacy FGI’s leader Maryanne Grisz acknowledged how integral the late Margaret Hayes and Diane Clehane were to creating the annual gala. Recalling how FGI was founded “by women and for women in 1930,” Grisz hinted at the next generation, wearing a gown designed by Cyril Verdavainne, a 2024 “Rising Star” winner. The organization now spans 26 regions as “a grassroots organization that can make change happen.” In addition to plans to make “Night of Stars” a global event, the group has launched a Thought Leaders Platinum Membership. You May Also Like Honoring Fern Mallis with the Founders award, MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle spoke of how fashion is “a really, really hard business behind-the scenes. Everyone in this room knows it. It is an industry where the margins are so small. One year you are the hottest, most fabulous, celebrated person and the next season you’re forgotten,” she said. Beyond being able to spot a trend and new talent, Ruhle praised Mallis for her realness and understanding of human nature, talent, hard work, drive and “what real mentorship is.” Hundreds of guests seemed to agree, giving Mallis, the architect behind New York Fashion Week and creator of “Fashion Icons” talks, the only standing ovation of the night. “I love being part of this extraordinary industry, which can be tough, challenging and sometimes even appreciative, but ultimately warm, generous, unpredictable and always creative,” Mallis said. “Remember my advice to succeed is, ‘Be nice and vote.’” Estée Lauder’s Catherine Bomboy Dougherty was saluted for championing education and literacy with poet Amanda Gorman and for helping to raise more than $50 million with MAC Viva Glam and Rihanna to benefit HIV and AIDS patients. The “Beauty” award winner, said, “Beauty is about more than appearances. It’s about empowerment, confidence, self-expression. I am so fortunate to work alongside people, who understand the power of beauty and helping others to feel seen and valued.” During the Night of Stars program, former “Night of Stars” winners like Elie Tahari and Dennis Basso took to the stage separately to toast FGI’s milestone and the organization. Presenting the “Vanguard” award to her business partner LaQuan Smith, Jacqueline Cooper recalled how they met “in a very organic, beautiful way — the club of New York City.” She said, “It’s crazy how he has been able to accomplish everything that he set out to do, but also be very true to himself, organic and still have this love of New York City and vibrancy that we don’t really see too often nowadays.” Smith said, “From a young boy growing up in Queens, N.Y., designing dresses in my grandmother’s basement, I have certainly come a long way.” Just as his grandparents “never wavered in their support” of him, Smith acknowledged Cooper’s support and shared the award with her. “Jackie is everything — my business partner, manager, wife, best friend. I’ve never had anyone who has fought so hard for me. We really do fight like cats and dogs — it’s really bad sometimes. But she is always there for me and saying, ‘LaQuan, today is a new day’ — no matter how hard it gets.” The 2024 “Humanitarian” award winner, Harry Kargman, Kargo’s founder and chief executive officer, was unable to attend the gala, due to the recent loss of his father-in-law Arie Kopelman, former president and chief operating officer of Chanel Inc. Heidi and Marc D’Amelio, and one of their influencer daughters Dixie, accepted the Media award on behalf of their social media-centric family, which has a reach of 400 million. (Their daughter Charli is busy preparing for her Broadway debut in “& Juliet.”) The New York City-born Marc D’Amelio clued in many to the fact that he had started his own clothing brand 20 years ago and that his great grandfather had been a dress designer in New York. “My wife came here from Louisiana and fashion brought us together. I remember being in Paris watching Dixie do a fashion shoot for Valentino, and Charli’s doing things for Prada,” he said. “I think about how fashion has impacted our lives and [the lives of] so many families in this audience. It’s really incredible what FGI is doing with all of the opportunities that’s it going to give to so many people to experience what my family has experienced.” Picking up the “Fashion Visionary” award, Reed Krakoff spoke of the significance of being celebrated by one’s peers, many of whom he’s grown up with in the industry in the past 30 years. “People like Fern, who was one of my early supporters. I think she was my only supporter at one point,” Krakoff quipped. “I actually was rejected by the CFDA once. Fern was instrumental in getting me in.” Highlighting his career stops at Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Coach, Tiffany & Co., and now John Hardy, Krakoff mentioned how along the way there were moments where someone saw something in him that he didn’t see. He singled out Hilfiger for tapping him as creative director, when that role was just emerging. He also mentioned how he joined Coach, despite having never designed a handbag, a fact that others were unaware of — but he learned. “This industry is so much more than a job. I’ve been so fortunate to have so many incredible relationships, experiences, travel, and ups and downs. As all of the creative people who came up here have mentioned, fashion is a tough business. But the relationships and the people are really what make it what it is,” he said. Accepting the “Fashion Heritage” award from the actress Kate Hudson, Max Mara’s Maria Giulia Prezioso Maramotti recalled how as a four-year-old she visited her grandfather at work drawing. “I still feel the same passion and excitement today that I felt when I was four years old. This is why, for us, Max Mara, is much more than a fashion house. It is our family legacy, a labor of love and it represents our values of the vision of my grandfather, when he founded the company in 1951.” Emphasizing how that continues, Maramotti said, “My family and I are committed to continuing our mission of creating beautiful, meaningful fashion that resonates across time, because after all, that is what heritage is about — the ability to transfer beauty and values across generations.” As The Plaza’s ballroom emptied out and some guests spoke of nightcaps, the D’Amelios gamely posed for selfies with attendees — they have “never refused a photo — ever,” according to Marc D’Amelio. That fan base inevitably could bode well for his kin’s next venture. With D’Amelio Footwear up-and-running, the plan is to do some licensing deals for accessories and other categories. One thing that most designers can’t do is play the piano with their toes, as Dixie D’Amelio can and occasionally still does. “Just to make sure that I still can — I’ve got a few songs,” she said, before being reeled into another selfie.

Title: Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) insiders seem bullish, own 55% and have been buying more recently
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicker-data-limited-asx-ddr-004032138.html

Dicker Data's significant insider ownership suggests inherent interests in company's expansion The top 2 shareholders own 54% of the company Insiders have been buying lately Every investor in Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 55% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). It's interesting to note that insiders have been buying shares recently. This could signal that stock prices could go up and insiders are here for it. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Dicker Data. See our latest analysis for Dicker Data Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Dicker Data does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Dicker Data's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Dicker Data is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Fiona Brown, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 31%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. David Dicker is the second largest shareholder owning 23% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 1.9% of the company stock. Interestingly, the second-largest shareholder, David Dicker is also Chief Executive Officer, again, pointing towards strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders. A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 54% stake. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. It seems that insiders own more than half the Dicker Data Limited stock. This gives them a lot of power. Given it has a market cap of AU$1.7b, that means insiders have a whopping AU$943m worth of shares in their own names. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to discover if they have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Dicker Data is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...
