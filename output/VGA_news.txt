The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. The decision is a potential watershed moment for US money managers, more than 70 of which have sought permission from the SEC to adopt the dual-class structure.

The comprehensive analysis dives deep into market size and emerging trends, profiles key industry players, and uncovers strategic opportunities shaping the industry landscape. With a spotlight on key market segments and applications, the nematicides market report highlights the factors set to drive market momentum in the years ahead. Engineered for Growth: Nematicides Market on Rapid Ascent Nematicides Market Set to Soar with increasing use of nematicides for crop protection and yield improvement, Valued at US$2.01 billion in 2024. The market is projected to reach US$3.84 billion by 2031, registering a strong CAGR of 9.8% (2025–2031). Increasing Use of Nematicides for Crop Protection and Yield Improvement Set to Shape Industry Outlook Check valuable insights in the Nematicides Market report. You can easily get a sample PDF of the report - https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00021800 Factors driving this growth include growing incidence and use of nematicides for crop protection and yield improvements, increasing prevalence of nematodes, and the expansion of organic farming and biological nematicides. More advanced formulations of nematicides, such as bio-based and targeted chemical alternatives, are now providing new solutions for nematode control, allowing sustainable agricultural practice and advancements for improved crop yields. Opportunities for the future market lie in overall technological advancements, eco-friendly solutions, and increased adoption of integrated pest management products, and the movement toward precision agriculture, making nematicides an integral part of modern crop protection and food security. Increasing Use of Nematicides for Crop Protection and Yield Improvement As agriculture becomes more intense and widespread, monoculture grows, nematode pressure increases, encouraging more chemical and biological nematicides use as first-line protection. Farmers across the globe are adopting nematicides as a part of their integrated crop management system to protect their yields and gain profit. The difference between treated and untreated plots is perfectly evident in high nematode environments. Research in South Africa from the National Library of Medicine, conducted from 2005 to 2011, reported average yield increases of 34% for the nematicide treatments, with yield increases as high as 367% in heavily nematode-affected soils. This research demonstrates the impact of the nematicide on growers as a critical input in commercial operations and smaller-scale farmers, divorcing all while government impacts over older products, such as Telone, produce a succession of re-regulatory measures in the near future. The United Nations approximates global population growth by nearly 2 billion during the next thirty years, from 8 billion in 2022 to 9.7 billion in 2050, and will peak in 2100 at nearly 10.4 billion. With a rise in the global population and the demand for food, agriculturists worldwide are focusing on modifying farming practices to obtain high crop yields from smaller cultivation areas. Consequently, increasing crop yields and ensuring they are protected properly is a top priority within agriculture, emphasizing the ongoing need for nematicides. The use of nematicides is not only reserved for global staple crops like corn, wheat, and rice. Farmers growing fruits, vegetables, cotton, and specialty crops rely on nematicides to produce a quality product with a profitable yield. Nematicides, particularly the newer bio-based products and reduced-risk nematicides, have gotten higher marks for effectiveness because they can target multiple nematode species and support environmental sustainability. As regulatory agencies are keener to enforce rules on traditional pesticides, there are opportunities to offer nematicides that are safer, more targeted products, and have little off-target and residual issues. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs also improve the utility of nematicides. Growers combine nematicides with improving practices such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, and soil health practices to build a more resilient farming system. Increased education and outreach efforts through agricultural associations and universities have raised awareness about nematodes, identification, and control, and have created even more demand for more modern nematicides. Surging Prevalence of Nematodes Drives Nematicides Market Growth As plant breeders and researchers incorporate natural or engineered resistance genes into important crops, growers depend on varieties that can withstand nematode attack without chemical treatment. This shift reduces reliance on nematicides, especially in regions or crop sectors where such resistance is highly effective and sustainable. The proliferation of nematode-resistant cultivars has been particularly transformative in several crops. Introducing the Mi gene from wild tomato into commercial tomato varieties delivers strong resistance to multiple root-knot nematode species. It has allowed large-scale tomato growers—especially in North Carolina, where up to 97% of the tobacco crop is planted using varieties resistant to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)—to reduce or even eliminate nematicide use. Likewise, resistance genes in potato, soybean, and sugar beet reduce the need for nematicides by providing the plants with natural protection from cyst nematodes and other important pests. However, there are challenges regarding consistently using resistant cultivars. The use of resistance genes does put selection pressure on nematode populations, leading to some risk of cows emerging with resistance genes that once worked, especially certain cyst nematodes of potato and soybean crops. Regardless, the bottom line is this: resistance shifts and farm markets move to using resistant varieties, and nematicide sales become stable or decrease in those crops. For instance, after the broad adoption of cyst nematode-resistant soybean varieties in the US, the use of nematicides in soybean diminished drastically. Similar patterns are seen in other crops. These crop advancements make nematicides less central to integrated pest management, especially where resistance is durable and widely deployed. Get Research Sample Copy of the Nematicides Market: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00021800 Geographical Insights According to the nematicides market analysis, Asia Pacific led the market in 2024, capturing the highest revenue share. This was attributed to the region's high-volume agricultural production, the increasing prevalence of high-yield crops, and progressive agricultural policies that foster sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the nematicide markets in North America and Europe also grew steadily due to the increasing adoption of precision agricultural practices, mulch technologies, and better nematicide solutions. Future estimates of the nematicides market reveal that the Asia Pacific will have the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) as agricultural production grows and the trend towards precision farming expands. Nematode-driven crop losses are becoming increasingly understood, particularly in countries such as China and India. This expected increase depicts a geographical change in market momentum, creating opportunities for nematicide manufacturers to expand operations within a given region and develop partnerships and affiliations. Market Segmentation Competitive Landscape and Major Developments Global Headlines on Nematicides i) Nufarm has introduced the new microbiological nematicide Evolvance at the Tecnoshow COMIGO 2025. Evolvance is a biological product for controlling nematodes in crops, such as beans, cotton, and maize, described by Nufarm as 'innovative'. It acts by building plant roots, which promote uniform growth during the early stages of growth, and provide a positive yield near the end of harvest. ii) Corteva Agriscience has launched an innovative approach to controlling plant-parasitic nematodes called Reklemel active. Plant-parasitic nematodes are small organisms that exist in soil and cause damage to a plant's roots. In fact, plant-parasitic nematodes represent a challenge to global food security, costing more than US$80 billion dollars a year in damages. Corteva has invested over ten years in the development of Reklemel active to protect various food crops and row crops from nematode damage while maintaining beneficial organisms in the soil. Get Premium Copy of Nematicides Market Size and Growth Report by 2031 at: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/buy/TIPRE00021800 Conclusion With global agricultural production on the rise and food security pressures and world food price levels rising, crop protection companies are under increased pressure to increase and improve their level of innovation. The demand for a larger-scale procurement of new, high-performing, and environmentally friendly nematicides is increasing, in turn driving activity across the wider nematicides supply chain. A growing supplier base of nematicides has increased farmers' choice, competitive pricing, and reduced lead times. All of these have positively impacted farmers' collective bargaining power, which is expected to continue through 2031. Simultaneously, the intensity of competition in the nematicides market has never been greater. A large number of nematicide companies, divided across geographies, are competing for market share based on the quality of their nematicide products, efficacy profiles, pricing, and delivery.
