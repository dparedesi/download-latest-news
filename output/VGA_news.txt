In the early morning hours of January 3, 2026, the United States military launched military strikes on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores have since been transported to the New York City to face charges relating to gun crimes and cocaine trafficking. The move has divided the MAGA base—and the American public more generally—with a large portion of President Donald Trump’s base viewing it as a betrayal of the principles he claimed to champion. Specifically, Trump has claimed for years he would not start new wars of aggression. While Trump has stated that taking out Maduro is not about launching new wars but instead a calculated attack to take out a man he blames for America’s fentanyl crisis, the facts tell another story. In May 2025, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) released its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). This report mentions Venezuela trafficking fentanyl to the US a total of zero times. Instead, it blames Mexican cartels for the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl. This should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention, as these facts are common knowledge among the US government and drug-trafficking researchers. A second key point is that although Trump and neocon Secretary of State Marco Rubio have repeatedly sought to tie Maduro to drug cartels, there remains scant evidence for the claim. The US government previously claimed Maduro was the head of the drug-trafficking group Cartel de los Soles (also known as the Cartel of the Suns). However, many skeptics have claimed the group doesn’t actually exist. During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted as the alleged leader of this cartel. In 2025, during his second term, Cartel de los Soles was officially designated a foreign terrorist organization. However, when Maduro was brought to NYC and officially charged, the US Department of Justice dropped the allegations from their indictment. The lack of charges relating to Cartel de los Soles is a signal that the US government does not believe it has strong enough evidence to convict Maduro in court. Instead, they have changed their tune and are now claiming Maduro was involved in cocaine trafficking. Hours after the raid and capture of Maduro, Trump held a press conference in which he made it perfectly clear that, despite official claims of targeting drug traffickers, the US government’s interest lies in gaining control over Venezuela’s oil industry. Make No Mistake – Venezuela is About Oil and Empire During a Saturday morning press conference, US President Donald Trump made it perfectly clear that despite claims of going after drug traffickers, the US government is interested in taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. pic.twitter.com/AJiyrh83j9 “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump stated. In 2007, Venezuela nationalized oil projects, seizing assets from companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after they refused to accept terms that would give the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) majority control. In contrast, companies like Total, Chevron, Statoil (now Equinor), and BP agreed to the restructuring and retained minority stakes in their Venezuelan projects. Trump has claimed that these actions were a theft of American oil and that part of the US presence in Venezuela will be to take this oil. “In addition, Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars. This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country. Considered the largest theft of property in the history of our country,” Trump said at the Saturday morning press conference. When pressed by journalists about his comments regarding the US “running” Venezuela, Trump responded by claiming that the oil companies would cover the costs of improvements to Venezuelan oil infrastructure. “Well, we’re gonna be running it with a group and we’re gonna make sure it’s run properly. We’re gonna rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars. It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly.” However, Trump also appeared to suggest that US taxpayers would subsidize oil companies to rebuild the infrastructure. “They will be reimbursed for what they’re doing, but, that’s gonna be paid. And we’re gonna get the oil flowing the way it should be,” Trump claimed. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump made a similar statement. “I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,” he said. “A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.” With Trump admitting that a major motivation for taking out Maduro was to benefit oil companies, it’s important to ask which companies are involved and who holds shares in them. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were involved in Venezuela’s oil sector before the nationalization under Hugo Chávez and during the subsequent US sanctions era. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the majority institutional shareholders of all three companies, typically controlling around 20-25% of the shares in each (with Vanguard and BlackRock often holding the largest stakes among institutions). Larry Fink is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of BlackRock. He’s also the current Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum. Fink also maintains a close relationship with Donald Trump, having known him for over 40 years due to both men having been involved in the Manhattan financial scene. In fact, in March 2025 it was announced that Larry Fink had consulted with Trump before he secured the purchase of two ports in the Panama Canal for BlackRock. Given Trump’s close relationship with Larry Fink, combined with BlackRock’s significant investments in major U.S. oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, these are more than likely influencing factors in the U.S. policy toward Venezuela’s oil sector. Fink is not the only billionaire benefiting handsomely from the capture of Maduro and the US occupation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Among the billionaires celebrating the US aggression is Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager whose firm, Elliot Investment Management, has long sought to acquire CITGO Petroleum, the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. In November 2025, a U.S. judge approved a $5.9 billion bid by an Elliott affiliate (Amber Energy) to purchase shares in CITGO’s parent company (PDV Holding) through a court-organized auction aimed at satisfying creditors’ claims against Venezuela. The sale still requires final approval from the U.S. Treasury Department and other regulators. CITGO’s assets include three major oil refineries (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), pipelines, terminals, and more than 4,000 CITGO-branded gas stations across the United States. With Trump relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil following the removal of Maduro, Singer stands to benefit to the tune of billions if the CITGO sale is eventually approved. Coincidentally, Singer was a major donor to Trump’s presidential campaigns, as well as to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). US Representative Thomas Massie has also claimed that Singer has already spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat him in his upcoming reelection bid. According to Grok, Paul Singer, globalist Republican mega-donor who’s already spent $1,000,000 to defeat me in the next election, stands to make billions of dollars on his distressed CITGO investment, now that this administration has taken over Venezuela.https://t.co/hq1STlEyAq It’s quite obvious that oil is one of the major drivers behind the US kidnapping of Maduro, but drugs and oil alone do not fully explain why Trump is desperate to have control over this region. In the early 20th century, a movement emerged around a political theory known as Technocracy—a system in which government and society would be managed by technical experts, often involving technology-focused solutions. Early proponents claimed that Technocracy would lead to better management of resources and the protection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, as well as centralization of power and the management of all human behavior. One of the most influential proponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer and engineer who founded the Technical Alliance in New York City in 1919. Scott believed that business owners lacked the necessary skills and data to reform their industries, and thus control should be handed over to engineers and scientists. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch established the “Committee on Technocracy” at Columbia University. The group would eventually splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated, while technocrat Harold Loeb headed the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication that outlined its vision for a Technocracy and their plan for merging North America and parts of central America into a single continental unit which they called a “Technate”: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit. [emphasis added] A 1940 map from Technocracy Inc. clearly shows this vision included Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries—including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and others. The fact that Panama was envisioned as part of the Technate should not be forgotten in light of Larry Fink’s efforts to purchase ports in the Panama Canal. The Technocrats also imagined controlling parts of Venezuela and even Colombia. The 1940 map shows portions of northern Venezuela and eastern Colombia absorbed by the Technate. Colombia’s place in the proposed Technate adds important context to Trump’s recent threats of military action in the nation. The Technocrats were not only focused on incorporating Central and South American nations into the Technate. They aimed to spread their techno-tyranny as far north as Greenland. In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

January 15, 2026 12:23 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global carbon credit market was valued at US$ 1,142.40 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 4,983.7 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 18% during the forecast period 2025–2035. The carbon credit market is on the cusp of unprecedented growth, largely propelled by robust corporate demand. In 2023 alone, companies retired an impressive 161 million carbon credits, reflecting a strong and sustained commitment to climate action. This momentum is further bolstered by over 5,200 firms that have adopted Science Based Targets (SBTs), aligning their emissions reduction strategies with the latest climate science. These companies represent a diverse cross-section of industries, all actively driving demand for carbon credits as part of their sustainability commitments, making corporate action a primary engine behind the market’s rapid expansion. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/carbon-credit-market This surge in demand is creating a distinct bifurcation within the carbon credit market, separating credits by type, quality, and price. On one end of the spectrum, low-cost renewable energy credits are trading at modest prices, often as low as $1 to $2 per ton. These credits represent emissions reductions from renewable power projects and serve as accessible entry points for companies with basic offsetting needs. On the other end, premium nature-based credits—originating from projects like forest conservation and reforestation—command prices exceeding $12 per ton. These projects offer additional environmental and social co-benefits, contributing to their higher valuation. Elevating Carbon Credits: From Offsets to Financial Assets The carbon credit market is evolving far beyond its original role as a straightforward mechanism for offsetting emissions. Today, it is rapidly transforming into a sophisticated financial ecosystem where carbon credits are recognized as valuable financial assets. This formalization marks a pivotal trend that is reshaping the market’s growth trajectory. A cornerstone of this financial evolution is the emergence of exchange-traded futures contracts for carbon credits. Platforms such as CME’s N-GEO futures have introduced standardized contracts that allow investors to buy and sell carbon credits on regulated exchanges. These futures contracts provide a level of price discovery, risk management, and market transparency that was previously elusive in the carbon market. In parallel with futures trading, the launch of over 15 specialized carbon investment funds in 2023 signals a growing institutional appetite for carbon assets. These funds pool capital from institutional investors eager to gain exposure to the carbon market’s growth potential while supporting climate action. By offering professionally managed portfolios focused exclusively on carbon credits and related projects, these funds provide an efficient entry point into this emerging asset class. Investment Flows and Compliance Markets Strengthen Supply Foundations: Global Carbon Credit Supply The global carbon credit supply landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, fueled by targeted investment and the emergence of expansive compliance frameworks. Over the past decade, capital has increasingly gravitated towards regions that combine robust regulatory environments with abundant nature-based carbon sequestration potential. Between 2013 and 2023, nearly $42 billion was funneled into the development of carbon projects worldwide, underscoring the mounting financial commitment to climate solutions. The momentum in investment shows no signs of slowing. In fact, 2024 is poised to become a record-breaking year for carbon credit fundraising, with $14 billion already committed or raised by the third quarter alone. This surge reflects heightened investor confidence and expanding interest among institutional players, corporations, and governments eager to participate in the carbon market. Large-scale compliance markets are playing a pivotal role in reshaping the supply side of the carbon credit ecosystem. These regulatory frameworks establish mandatory emission reduction targets and create strong demand for verified carbon offsets, thereby incentivizing the development of high-quality projects. Regions with established compliance systems attract disproportionate investment and project activity, as market participants seek the certainty and legitimacy these frameworks provide. Tech-Based Carbon Credits: Rising to Market Prominence Technology-based carbon credits have rapidly ascended to a dominant position in the carbon credit market, capturing an impressive 46.9% share. This surge reflects a growing preference among buyers for solutions that provide permanent, reliable, and verifiable carbon removal. As climate goals become more ambitious and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, the demand for carbon credits backed by cutting-edge technologies has skyrocketed. A key driver behind the popularity of tech-based carbon credits is their ability to deliver permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Unlike nature-based solutions, which are susceptible to risks such as forest fires, disease, or land-use changes that can release stored carbon back into the environment, technologies like Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) provide a more secure and lasting solution. Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies stand at the forefront of the tech-based carbon credit market. DAC systems actively extract CO2 directly from ambient air, concentrating it for storage or utilization, while CCS captures emissions at their source and safely stores them underground. Both methods offer scalability and measurable results, making them attractive solutions as industries strive to offset hard-to-abate emissions. Carbon Removal Projects: The New Market Vanguard Carbon removal projects have surged to dominate the market, commanding a remarkable 75.3% share that reflects a profound shift in global climate strategy. The focus has evolved from merely preventing future emissions to actively extracting existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This pivot underscores the urgency of addressing legacy carbon, which accumulates from decades of industrial activity. A significant portion of carbon removal projects leverages nature-based solutions, which utilize natural processes to capture and store carbon. A striking example from 2024 is an Amazon rainforest reforestation initiative that planted 10 million trees, with a projected CO2 removal potential of 2 million tonnes. These projects not only sequester carbon but also provide co-benefits such as biodiversity preservation, enhanced ecosystem resilience, and improved local livelihoods. Alongside nature-based efforts, technological carbon removal solutions are rapidly advancing, contributing to the market’s dominant share. These include direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and mineralization techniques designed to extract and securely store CO2. Technological removals offer the advantage of scalability and permanence, often complementing nature-based projects. Europe’s Commanding Lead in the Carbon Credit Market Europe firmly holds a dominant position in the global carbon credit market, commanding over 51.10% of the market share. This leadership is rooted in the region’s well-established and mature compliance frameworks, which provide a robust regulatory foundation that drives both mandatory and voluntary carbon offsetting activities. Europe’s pioneering approach to carbon management has set a global benchmark, particularly through its emphasis on high-permanence carbon removals that ensure long-term environmental impact. At the heart of Europe’s carbon credit market strength is the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which remains the world’s largest and most advanced carbon pricing mechanism. In 2024, allowances within the ETS consistently traded above €70 per tonne of CO2, reflecting the region’s intense regulatory pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This high carbon price creates a compelling financial incentive for industries to lower their emissions and invest in offset projects, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The stringent regulatory environment in Europe also fuels vibrant activity in the voluntary carbon credit market. In the past year alone, European companies retired over 52 million carbon credits, demonstrating a strong corporate commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainability goals. Leading energy giants such as Shell and Eni have spearheaded this movement, establishing significant offtake agreements that drive demand for high-quality carbon credits.

We’ll invest in integrations with the tools lawyers already live in (e.g., Microsoft 365 and CRMs), and scale distribution through partnerships and product awareness. As we expand, we’ll keep a lawyer-first product roadmap, adding new workflows and practice-area modules, while building customer success that drives sustained adoption and long-term expansion. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Bradwell is female-founded and female-led, as both co-founders are women! We’ve built a team with a mix of backgrounds (legal practice, product, engineering, and AI research), so we get different perspectives in the room and build better. We run the team on clear norms: be kind, be sharp, and do remarkable work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? At Bradwell, we’re building legal technology that works for any legal professional, and we take pride in the following: Through these efforts, we aim not only to make an impact within our company, but also to inspire the broader legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name Candle AI Elevator Pitch Candle AI is the legal email assistant that helps small and mid-sized law firms eliminate email overload freeing up hours for higher-value work. It works right inside Outlook/Gmail and 1) instantly pulls client and case details from systems like Clio and Filevine into the inbox, 2) drafts accurate, context-aware replies in second, and 3) manages email templates so you can respond to clients faster. Lawyers and paralegals save up to 90 mins per day on email and respond to clients up to 75% faster. What makes your company unique or innovative? While most legal AI tools require lawyers to leave their inbox, navigate case systems, and learn complex prompts, Candle brings the legal workspace directly into Outlook and Gmail, where legal teams already do a lot of their work, so there’s no workflow change. Our AI leverages firm-specific data, templates, and systems, reducing risk while improving accuracy and compliance. We turn email from one of the biggest time drains in a law firm into a revenue-driver and client service advantage. This helps reduce non-billable time and enables law firms to provide alternative billable models which focus on efficiency and productivity. What problem does your product solve? Attorneys spend a large portion of their day on email (up to 66%), constantly switching between inbox, case management systems, and documents. This leads to a loss of focus, lost billable time, and slower client responses. Candle significantly reduces context switching and drafts accurate email responses instantly, helping legal teams work faster and stay focused. We are also focused on empowering small and mid-size law firms and giving them a competitive advantage through Candle AI. Who are your competitors? There are general AI email assistants such as Superhuman, Copilot and Gemini which focus on individual productivity but are not designed for law firm workflows or shared case context. There are also legal specific tools such as Vesence and August that offer Outlook and Microsoft-based integrations and helpful assistance with email composition and summarizing. Candle AI takes a different approach by treating email as the central workspace for a lot of legal work. Most client communication and case activity already happen in the inbox. By integrating directly with systems such as Clio, Filevine, CasePeer, and INSZoom, Candle AI brings fuller matter context into Outlook and Gmail and connects email to the firm’s systems of record. This allows Candle to automate client communication and support legal teams beyond drafting and summarizing.

Our team reflects multiple ethnic backgrounds including immigrant heritage and legal experience. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? One of our co-founders is a former immigration attorney, and the other is an immigrant, which shaped our initial focus on supporting immigration law firms that serve individual immigrants. That lived and professional experience informs how we design Candle AI to reduce administrative burden and improve communication for legal teams working with high email volume and helping clients who are in high stress situations. We support firms by making technology accessible without requiring major workflow changes. We also actively involve attorneys from diverse backgrounds in product feedback to ensure the platform works well for firms of different sizes and practice areas. Anything else you’d like us to know?

Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our primary goal within the next year is to refine the product and spread through Texas. Following Texas, we will have state specific features for the top five states for the legal community (TX, IL, NY, CA, FL). Following a commanding presence within the Big 5, we will spread to where we are most needed in the US. We are also looking at relationships with lawyers in India but that may not materialize within the next five years depending on revenue. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. The primary owner is an African American man. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know?

We have since changed our name to CaseCreate, refined our branding, and cleaned up our web functionality so we are ready for this year. Company Name ChronoTracer Elevator Pitch ChronoTracer helps litigators and investigators easily master the facts of their case. It automatically creates a complete, defensible chronology from evidence, transforming emails, texts, social media, call logs, media files, and other formats into structured events. With deterministic extraction and instant, intuitive filtering, teams surface what matters immediately and stop wasting weeks building chronologies by hand. What makes your company unique or innovative? ChronoTracer is the only platform that begins with a full chronology rather than an empty container. It automatically assembles comprehensive, source-linked events across every major evidence type with no hallucinations or guesswork. Automatic, deterministic extraction lets ChronoTracer reach tens of millions of events – something manual, drag-and-drop tools simply can’t do. It requires no integrations, is easy to adopt, and offers fast onboarding, minimal training, and SOC 2–aligned controls. What problem does your product solve? Even with modern e-discovery systems, building a factual chronology remains a slow, manual task. Teams spend countless hours stitching together communications, phone logs, and documents just to understand what happened and when. This slows strategy, obscures patterns, and forces costly, repetitive review cycles. ChronoTracer eliminates that bottleneck by generating a full, structured chronology automatically—and then making it effortless to filter and search for exactly the events, custodians, channels, time periods, or themes teams need. Instead of hunting through evidence, users get clarity on day one instead of week six. Who are your competitors? ChronoTracer competes with spreadsheets and other manual chronology-building approaches, e-discovery and fact-management platforms that require drag-and-drop timelines, digital forensic consultants who produce reports with specialized tools, and various start-ups focused on fact organization. These alternatives rely heavily on human effort, limiting accuracy, slowing insight, and capping the volume they can handle. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/e09d14d2bb1d40ae8eeda303771a7686 When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Large and medium-sized law firms and boutique litigation firms that handle cases with high evidence volumes; investigation teams; corporate legal departments; and government. What is the price of your product or service? Ranges from $5k-$20k per month depending on evidence complexity and volume. Tell us more about your traction. We have supported several large high-profile cases, including an FCPA case, a federal public corruption case and a state RICO case. We are also supporting complex civil cases, internal investigations and international arbitrations. Customers have told us that they could not have handled some of these cases without ChronoTracer. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, ChronoTracer will grow through a mix of direct sales and strategic partnerships. We are currently focused on selling directly to law firms handling complex litigation and investigations. In the coming year, we will expand distribution by partnering with e-discovery service providers and selling directly to corporate legal departments for internal investigations and compliance matters. As the platform matures, we will also work with government contractors to introduce ChronoTracer to investigative agencies, attorneys general, regulators, auditors, and prosecution teams. This multi-channel strategy positions ChronoTracer to become the standard chronology solution across the legal and investigative ecosystem. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our five-person core team is meaningfully diverse. We include individuals from different religious traditions, ethnic backgrounds, genders, national origins, and sexual orientations. These varied perspectives shape how we build ChronoTracer and how we support our customers. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As a young company, our broader community impact is still developing, but we aim to contribute meaningfully over time. As we grow, we plan to support pro bono litigation and the legal teams pursuing cases that align with our values. Anything else you’d like us to know? I attended last year’s event and the startup showcase, and it was clear how valuable the forum is for new legal technology providers. We would welcome the opportunity to introduce ChronoTracer to this year’s audience. Company Name CollBox. Elevator Pitch CollBox helps law firms get paid 40% faster without turning lawyers into bill collectors. We automate and manage accounts receivable using smart reminders, integrated workflows, and a human-first approach that reduces write-offs, shortens payment cycles, and improves cash flow—while preserving client relationships. $100M+ recovered for small to mid-sized firms. Awarded Best Business of Law App in the 2025 Clio Integration Awards. What makes your company unique or innovative? CollBox is unique because we don’t treat accounts receivable as a software-only problem. Most legal tools stop at sending reminders. CollBox combines intelligent automation with trained, U.S.-based A/R specialists who step in when automation alone isn’t enough. Our platform is purpose-built for law firms, integrating directly into their billing workflows and applying proven collections strategies that preserve client relationships. This hybrid model, AI-assisted automation plus human follow-up, helps firms get paid faster without asking attorneys or staff to become bill collectors. We’ve modernized a critical but neglected function in legal operations by making collections proactive, measurable, and client-friendly. What problem does your product solve? Law firms struggle to get paid on time for work they’ve already completed. Invoices go unpaid, follow-ups are inconsistent, and collections often fall to attorneys or overextended staff – none of whom are trained or incentivized to manage accounts receivable effectively. This results in delayed cash flow, write-offs, administrative strain, and uncomfortable client interactions. Most legal software stops at sending automated reminders and offers no real strategy for collecting overdue balances. CollBox solves this by turning accounts receivable into a structured, proactive process—helping law firms reduce payment delays, recover more revenue, and eliminate the burden of collections from their legal teams. Who are your competitors? CollBox operates in a category that overlaps with, but is distinct from, several existing solutions. Our closest alternatives are law firm billing and practice management platforms (such as Clio, MyCase and Smokeball) that offer basic invoice reminders but stop short of managing accounts receivable or collections strategy. Some firms also rely on in-house staff or traditional collection agencies, which are either inefficient, costly, or harmful to client relationships – especially for work in progress or recently completed matters. Unlike these options, CollBox is purpose-built to manage the full accounts receivable lifecycle for law firms, combining automation with human follow-up in a client-friendly way. We don’t replace billing software or act as a collection agency; we fill the critical gap between invoicing and getting paid. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYKZcWJlYA When was the company founded? 2015-12-21. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized law firms (~3-30 attorneys). What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $599/month. ARPU is $775/month. Largest client pays $2,280/month. Pricing is based on the volume of clients a law firm bills in a typical month. They are then paced on a flat monthly subscription fee where they keep 100% of dollars recovered. Clean-up is available for older invoices for an additional one-time project fee (avg. of $10,000). Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. CollBox is launching a new funding round in January 2026. The goal of this raise is to encode years of accounts receivable mastery from what is already the leading A/R solution for SMB law firms into an AI-driven operating system that gets law firms paid for their hard work and minimizes attorney & legal staff involvement – quickly, reliably, automatically. There is no clear leader in the market for solving the cash flow crisis that is rampant in SMB law firms and practice management systems’ features aren’t getting the job done. CollBox intends to define the accounts-receivable category in legal and cross $1B recovered for law firms by the end of 2030. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. CollBox is intentionally building a diverse, multi-lingual, and inclusive team across professional background, geography, and lived experience. Our leadership combines expertise from financial operations, technology, and customer service, including professionals who have worked alongside law firms. We employ team members from a range of geographic locations and career paths, prioritizing skills, empathy, and communication over traditional credentials alone. This diversity of perspective is critical to our human-first approach to accounts receivable, where prioritizing the dignity of law firm clients and maintaining respectful relationships matters even more than the technology we create. As we grow, we are committed to inclusive hiring practices and building a team that reflects the diversity of the legal professionals and clients we serve. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? CollBox contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access for law firms that historically lack the resources of larger organizations. By making professional-grade accounts receivable support affordable and scalable, we help small and midsize firms—many of which are minority-owned, women-owned, or first-generation practices—run healthier, more sustainable businesses. We also prioritize respectful, client-friendly communication in our collections approach, reinforcing ethical, inclusive practices that protect both firms and the clients they serve. Internally and externally, we value collaboration, transparency, and empathy, and we actively participate in legal industry events, education, and knowledge-sharing to help firms of all backgrounds succeed. Anything else you’d like us to know? While founded technically in 2015, we created CollBox for law firms just 2.5 years ago when we launched our product into the Clio ecosystem, which earned us recognition as one of the best three new apps in the 2023 Clio Integration Awards. Company Name CounselPro Elevator Pitch CounselPro is the AI financial intelligence engine for legal professionals. We instantly structure years of raw PDF financial history (bank statements, check images, and credit card records) into audit-ready data. Whether tracing commingled assets or auditing bankruptcy filings, we replace weeks of manual entry with instant precision. Our platform delivers a source-linked audit trail, turning chaotic discovery into defensible legal strategy in minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? While the legal AI boom has focused almost entirely on text (drafting, research, and contracts), CounselPro solves the massive, ignored bottleneck of financial data. We are the first platform to successfully automate the “forensic loop” for legal professionals. Our innovation lies in three key differentiators: What problem does your product solve? We solve the “Financial Discovery Bottleneck.” In high-stakes litigation like divorce, bankruptcy, and fraud, the “smoking gun” is often hidden within thousands of pages of PDF bank statements. Extracting this evidence is currently a broken, manual nightmare. Legal teams are forced to burn billable hours or paralegal budgets on “stare and compare” data entry in Excel. This is low-value grunt work that kills morale and destroys margins. Beyond the cost, this manual process introduces significant risk. Human review suffers from fatigue, leading to high error rates where critical fraudulent transfers or hidden accounts are easily missed. Existing tools fail to bridge this gap. OCR software merely provides raw text, while accounting platforms require pristine data to function. CounselPro solves the disconnect between “raw PDF” and “legal strategy,” eliminating the manual friction that makes financial cases so expensive, slow, and prone to error. Who are your competitors? Valid8, Docuclipper, Lido. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.counselpro.ai/watch. When was the company founded? 2024-07-01. Where is the company located? New York, N.Y. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to midsized law firms specializing in bankruptcy, family law, estate planning, accounting, and PI. What is the price of your product or service? Tiered based on usage, from $100/mo – $5,000+/mo. Tell us more about your traction. In the first six months of active selling, CounselPro onboarded 50 law firms entirely through inbound demand, with zero outbound sales. All acquisition to date has come from referrals, SEO, and GEO-driven discovery, indicating strong product market fit. Customers include solo family law practitioners, U.S. bankruptcy trustees, accounting consultancies, and teams working on complex federal civil rights matters. Adoption is fully self-service. Users discover the product independently, onboard without assistance, and see immediate value on their first set of documents. Revenue is driven by subscription and usage-based expansion as customers apply CounselPro to additional matters. The product is used on live cases, and multiple customers have described it as a “game changer” for financial discovery. Volume: we have already processed over $10B+ in financial transactions, proving our architecture scales to enterprise demands immediately. Retention: we are seeing rapid expansion within firms; once a single partner uses CounselPro for one case, it typically becomes the standard operating procedure for the entire firm’s financial discovery. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our growth strategy is grounded in doubling down on the channels and behaviors that have already driven organic adoption, while expanding the surface area of the product within the legal ecosystem. We will continue to lead with a product-led, self-service motion supported by educational content that addresses real financial discovery problems. This includes practice-area-specific guides, examples, and workflows that help practitioners understand not just how to use the product, but how to apply financial intelligence more effectively in litigation. In parallel, we plan to deepen our presence at industry events where hands-on demonstrations matter, including ABA TECHSHOW and other practitioner-focused conferences. Live exposure to real documents consistently accelerates understanding and adoption. We will also pursue partnerships and integrations with widely adopted practice management and case management platforms that lawyers already use every day. Potential partners include Stretto, Clio, and Smokeball. These integrations allow CounselPro to fit naturally into existing workflows and reduce friction in how financial documents move from intake to analysis. Finally, we plan to expand the product’s analytical capabilities and supported use cases across bankruptcy, family law, fraud, and complex civil litigation while maintaining disciplined growth. Our goal is to become the default financial intelligence layer for legal professionals by making the product indispensable, rather than sales driven. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. As a bootstrapped company, our leadership and workforce reflect a diversity of incentives and perspectives that are often absent in venture-backed legal tech. Because we are not constrained by VC growth mandates, predefined pricing models, or top-down product roadmaps, we stay directly aligned with the day-to-day realities of legal professionals doing complex financial work. This structure allows us to build alongside our users, not above them. Product decisions are driven by real practitioner feedback across firm sizes, practice areas, and geographies rather than by investor expectations. In practice, this results in more accessible pricing, faster iteration on real problems, and tooling that serves solo and small firms just as effectively as larger ones. We believe this proximity to the problem creates a more inclusive product and a more representative legal-tech ecosystem by ensuring that advanced financial analysis tools are not limited to firms with large budgets or enterprise buying power. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We contribute to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering the barrier to advanced financial analysis for firms that have historically been priced out of it. Today, meaningful financial discovery often requires expensive forensic accountants, large internal teams, or enterprise-only software. That reality disproportionately favors well-resourced firms and limits access for solo practitioners, small firms, legal aid organizations, and professionals working in underserved jurisdictions. CounselPro changes that dynamic. By delivering court-defensible financial intelligence through self-service software and usage-based pricing, we make sophisticated forensic capabilities available to a much broader range of legal professionals. This enables more equitable representation for end clients and allows smaller firms to compete on analytical depth, not headcount or budget. We believe inclusivity in legal tech is not just about who builds the software, but who is empowered to use it… and who ultimately benefits from it. Anything else you’d like us to know? The legal industry is at an inflection point where AI adoption is moving beyond drafting and research into operational, evidence-driven workflows. Financial discovery is one of the major categories still dominated by manual processes and spreadsheets. CounselPro exists because this shift cannot be solved with general-purpose AI. It requires defensibility, traceability, and domain-specific logic. We believe this category will define the next wave of legal technology, and we are building the foundational platform for it. Company Name DraftyAI Elevator Pitch DraftyAI is an AI-powered drafting and case-prep tool built specifically for immigration attorneys. It helps lawyers generate high-quality USCIS briefs, motions, and support letters in minutes using their own templates, evidence, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. By automating the most time-consuming part of immigration practice, DraftyAI saves attorneys up to 60% of drafting time while maintaining attorney control, accuracy, and data security. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most legal AI tools are generic, prompt-based, or optimized for research – not real legal work. DraftyAI is immigration-first, built by practicing immigration attorneys, and designed around how cases are actually prepared. We combine guided workflows, template-based drafting, evidence uploads, and jurisdiction-aware formatting to produce filing-ready drafts. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys spend 40–60% of their time drafting repetitive, high-stakes documents, often nights and weekends, because outsourcing is expensive and generic AI is risky. This bottleneck limits case volume, increases burnout, and delays filings for clients. DraftyAI removes drafting as the choke point in immigration practice by turning hours of manual writing into minutes, without sacrificing quality, accuracy, or attorney oversight. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include immigration-specific AI tools such as CaseBlink, Visalaw.ai, Parley, Imagility, and Visas.ai, as well as general legal drafting tools embedded in platforms like Clio or Filevine. Unlike research-focused or form-centric tools, DraftyAI is purpose-built for immigration case preparation and drafting, with an emphasis on real attorney workflows, template control, and filing-ready output.

DraftyAI primarily serves solo, small, and mid-sized U.S. immigration law firms (1–25 attorneys), including employment-based, family-based, asylum, and removal defense practices. Our customers are firms handling moderate to high case volume that need to scale drafting and case preparation without increasing headcount or risking quality, compliance, or burnout.

We are seeing steady month-over-month growth in users and engagement, with strong retention among firms that incorporate DraftyAI into their daily workflows. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, DraftyAI will expand from an immigration-specific drafting solution into a broader case preparation and workflow platform for immigration law firms. Near-term growth focuses on deepening value for existing customers through enhanced drafting workflows, collaboration features, and integrations with popular immigration tech stacks. Mid-term, we will scale distribution through strategic partnerships, CLE-driven education, and bar association engagement. Long-term, our goal is to become the default infrastructure layer for immigration case preparation, supporting firms as they scale volume, improve quality, and reduce burnout, while maintaining strict attorney oversight and compliance. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. DraftyAI is led by a woman immigration attorney and immigrant founder, and was built alongside two co-founders who are also immigrants. We come from different professional backgrounds (law, engineering, and operations) and built this company through years of trust, collaboration, and shared values rather than a traditional startup pipeline. As immigrants and children of immigrants, our lived experiences directly inform the way we approach immigration law, legal technology, and the responsibility that comes with building tools lawyers rely on for high-stakes work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? DraftyAI contributes to a more inclusive legal tech community by making advanced AI tools accessible to immigration lawyers who are often left out of traditional legal tech, especially solo and small immigration firms, many of which are led by women, immigrants, and first-generation professionals. We focus on affordability, ease of use, and education. That means transparent pricing, free trials, and free resources that help lawyers understand and use AI responsibly without needing a technical background or enterprise budget. Our goal is to make modern legal technology feel usable and safe for everyday practitioners, not just large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? DraftyAI was built by immigration lawyers who have lived the realities of high-stakes casework, client anxiety, and burnout. Our approach to AI is intentionally conservative, attorney-centered, and compliance-first. We believe the future of legal tech isn’t about replacing lawyers; it’s about protecting their judgment, time, and well-being, especially in practice areas where the human impact is profound. Company Name EstateMin Elevator Pitch EstateMin modernizes trusts and estates departments. We replace pen-and-paper and fragmented processes with a structured, digital intake workflow that captures accurate client information upfront, reduces administrative burden, and improves the client experience from first contact. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateMin was built to replace the pen-and-paper workflows still common in trusts and estates. Co-founded by a former Clio Product Manager, probate paralegal and a technical co-founder, we use AI to rapidly ship updates and new features based on real law firm needs. Since launching in September, EstateMin has been adopted by over 20 paying firms. What problem does your product solve? Collecting intake information for every asset, debt and beneficiary in an estate takes hours when done manually. EstateMin replaces this fragmented, pen-and-paper process with a structured digital intake, saving significant staff time, reducing errors, and allowing firms to start matters with complete and usable client information from day one. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are pen-and-paper intake processes and legacy workflows. In the software market, alternatives include Trustate and Decision Vault, with many of our customers having already converted from these solutions. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/34b38e1f115440fb972a945ff85a370c. When was the company founded? 2025-09-08. Where is the company located? Boston, Mass.

What is the price of your product or service? $99-$250 per month. Tell us more about your traction.

To support scale, we prioritized deep integrations and partnered with Clio before expanding into the U.S. market. In August, we onboarded three U.S. pilot firms—100% of which converted to paying customers. Since launch, EstateMin is live with firms in over 10 U.S. states, supporting multiple users and active matters. To date, more than 70 estates are live on the platform, with law firms and their clients actively using the product. We have also had four one-call closes, where firms signed up and paid within a single 40-minute demo and are now active users. One Florida firm said, “I had high expectations and they have been exceeded.” Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, EstateMin will scale from client intake into a full estate lifecycle platform. Our near-term focus is growth within trusts and estates practices, with a target of 300 law firms by the end of 2026, representing approximately $950K in ARR. From there, we will expand into a digital estate vault, extending access to accountants and wealth managers. Using AI, the platform will continuously track and update clients’ entire estates during their lifetime, creating a shared, accurate source of truth across professional advisors. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. EstateMin is led and co-founded by a female CEO. Diversity and inclusion are core to our leadership perspective and inform how we build, partner with law firms, and support the legal community.

From intake, to drafting, and client funding on the backend, EstateScribe automates the entire process, so attorneys can focus on what really matters, advising their clients. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateScribe is the first AI-native drafting engine built exclusively for estate planners. Unlike tools that bolt AI onto legacy templates or offer a simple chatbot, we designed our system from the ground up to mirror the attorney workflow—starting with intake, continuing through interview mapping and logic validation, and ending with a fully-formatted, attorney-level plan. Our platform uses a hybrid approach combining deterministic legal logic, a proprietary knowledge map, and a context-aware generative model trained on structure rather than client data. Every edit, decision, and dependency across the matter is connected. When the attorney updates a key fact or changes a distribution scheme, the entire drafting system updates downstream provisions automatically and transparently. This makes EstateScribe the first tool that can actually think like an estate-planning attorney, rather than merely assemble documents. Streamlining intake, voice transcribing client interviews, drafting in seconds vs. hours, and always keeping the attorney in the loop is the core of the EstateScribe platform. While legal tech broadly is crowded, estate planning is uniquely underserved. Most innovation has focused on litigation, CLM, or large-firm workflows. Trusts and estates — especially for solo and small firms — remain dominated by legacy template tools and manual processes. What problem does your product solve? Estate-planning attorneys spend an enormous amount of time on repetitive drafting: combing through intake forms, reconciling notes, updating provisions, formatting long trust documents, and making sure every related clause stays consistent. Traditional automation tools require rigid templates, complex interviews, or manual exports into Word – slowing attorneys down instead of speeding them up. We built this while running an Estate Planning firm, so we know these problems because we’ve lived them firsthand. We found that almost 90% of our time was spent on intake and drafting, rather than the actual fun and useful part of running a law firm, which is spending time with more clients to ensure their plans are as effective as possible. EstateScribe solves this by eliminating the manual drudgery of intake, drafting, and client communication. Attorneys upload their intake worksheet or fill out our interactive digital interview, and EstateScribe generates a jurisdiction-specific, cleanly formatted estate plan that reflects attorney preferences, standard clauses, and state law nuances. The system flags and explains every AI-generated section, ensures consistency across all documents, and preserves attorney control. The result: faster drafting, dramatically fewer errors, and the ability for attorneys to scale their practice without burning out or hiring additional staff. Estate planning is one of the few areas of the law that consistently bills at a fixed fee rate, so the more efficient attorneys can be, the higher their margins or the ability to adjust pricing to have as competitive advantage in the market. My co-founder and I didn’t start this journey hoping to be legal tech founders, we started hoping to build a main-street law firm that could offer top tier estate planning for clients in our town. With all the amazing things happening in the legal tech ecosystem, we were ready to sign up for the latest and greatest AI product for estate planners, yet nothing came. After scheduling every demo out there and trying to wrap our heads around why no one was changing this industry like they were PI, Litigation, and Corporate Law, we decided it was time to do something about it. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are WealthCounsel, InteractiveLegal, HotDocs and other legacy drafting platforms. We have competition from the direct-to-consumer side from companies like Trust&Will.com, Vanilla, Wealth.com, Legal Zoom, and Estate Guru. We firmly believe in the importance of the estate planning attorney in the process. The estate-planning market broadly breaks into three distinct verticals, each serving a different customer with different incentives, economics, and risk profiles. 1. Direct-to-Consumer Estate Planning. Examples: LegalZoom, Trust & Will. These platforms sell estate-planning documents directly to consumers, typically at low price points. Strengths: Limitations: These tools serve basic needs, but they are not substitutes for attorney-led planning, especially as estates grow more complex. 2. B2B Through Wealth Managers/RIAs. Examples: RIA-embedded estate planning tools, advisor-led document platforms (wealth.com, vanilla, Estate guru). These solutions position estate planning as a value-add for financial advisors, often using attorneys behind the scenes. Strengths: Limitations: These platforms work well for select advisor-driven use cases, but they don’t meaningfully modernize how estate-planning attorneys actually practice law. 3. EstateScribe’s Vertical: B2B for Attorneys. EstateScribe is built specifically for estate-planning attorneys – not consumers and not intermediaries. We believe this is the most defensible and scalable segment because: Our approach preserves attorney oversight while unlocking efficiency, consistency, and scale. The majority of estate plans in the U.S. are drafted by solo and small-firm attorneys, yet this group has been historically underserved by both consumer platforms (too simplistic), and enterprise legal tech (too expensive and rigid). By focusing on B2B for attorneys, EstateScribe: This creates a structurally defensible position that consumer-facing or advisor-centric platforms cannot easily replicate. EstateScribe does not compete by replacing attorneys or bypassing them. We compete by making attorneys dramatically more effective, enabling them to serve more clients –including underserved middle-class families – while maintaining quality, compliance, and trust. A core principle of EstateScribe’s strategy is that attorneys must see us as partners, not threats. While the other verticals bypass the attorney entirely or reduce their role a post-hoc rubber stamp, we are intentionally designed to be the opposite. Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Jackson, Wyo. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small and solo estate-planning firms, boutique trusts and estates practices, and any attorney looking to scale without increasing staff overhead. Our platform is built for the 1–10 attorney firm where time savings, workflow efficiency, and document quality have an immediate and direct economic impact. However, we also see opportunity to address estate planning departments within larger firms to help increase the volume and capabilities in that specific niche. What is the price of your product or service? $350/month/seat (1 free paralegal, additional paralegal +100). Custom enterprise pricing for large firms. Tell us more about your traction. EstateScribe has secured pilot commitments from estate-planning firms in Wyoming and Texas – our initial rollout states – and has expanded into early interest from firms in Maryland and Kentucky. We recently secured a co-marketing agreement with 8am, providing us access to a broad distribution channel. We presented on the Solutions Showcase stage at Legal Tech Connect NYC, have been invited to meet with the Wyoming State Bar Estate Planning Counsel, and attended The Legal Tech Fund Summit 2025. Multiple firms are in our onboarding pipeline as we prepare for a public launch. Our MVP has already demonstrated the ability to produce attorney-level estate plans in minutes, dramatically accelerating drafting and intake workflows, and is in use at our law firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. In five years, EstateScribe will be the default drafting and workflow platform for estate-planning attorneys nationwide – trusted, embedded, and indispensable – while enabling firms to scale profitably and better serve the underserved middle-class market. We believe technology should amplify attorney judgment, not replace it. EstateScribe is built on the premise that senior legal expertise remains essential, even as drafting, intake, and workflow become increasingly automated. Our growth strategy follows a deliberate, credibility-first path: 1. Establish category leadership in standard to mid-complexity estate planning. We will initially dominate the $250,000–$15 million net-worth segment, where the majority of estate-planning demand exists and where inefficiencies most directly constrain firm growth. This segment offers the strongest combination of volume, repeatability, and immediate ROI for attorneys. 2. Expand upward without alienating the profession. Rather than positioning EstateScribe as “AI replacing lawyers,” we position it as infrastructure for modern estate-planning firms. As adoption grows, we will increasingly support higher-complexity practices by accelerating drafting, enforcing consistency, and reducing operational drag—without compromising attorney oversight. 3. Product expansion driven by real practitioner demand. Our V2 roadmap includes asset protection planning, complex irrevocable trusts, business formation services, probate automation, and related workflows. These expansions will be released incrementally, informed by real-world usage data and direct feedback from practicing attorneys—not speculative feature development. 4. State-by-state credibility, then national scale. We are launching in beachhead states (Wyoming and Texas), where our Chief Legal Officer is licensed and actively practices, ensuring product validity and practitioner trust. While the platform is architected for all 50 states, we will continue expanding through pilot firms in each jurisdiction to validate document quality and state-specific compliance. Our goal is nationwide availability by the end of 2026. 5. Relationship-led growth. Our core growth engine is user trust. EstateScribe was built directly out of an estate-planning practice, and we believe sustained adoption depends on deep practitioner alignment. As a result, our early scaling investments prioritize customer success and support. This approach ensures high retention, strong word-of-mouth growth, and a product that evolves alongside its users. We have unique insights from running an active estate planning practice and can sell to our customers better than anyone else. Our hope is for founder-led sales to get us established and growing exponentially until we can justify/it makes sense from a growth perspective to hire an outbound sales team. By combining disciplined market entry, practitioner-driven product expansion, and a clear respect for the attorney’s role, EstateScribe is positioned to become the long-term infrastructure layer for estate-planning firms nationwide. Have you received outside funding? $250k in friends-and-family round in addition to reinvesting our law firm revenue into the company. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. We are a first-generation founding team operating out of rural markets in Wyoming and Idaho – areas traditionally underrepresented in legal tech innovation. Our leadership backgrounds span law, trust administration, engineering, and entrepreneurship. We work with distributed engineering talent, including individuals from underrepresented groups in software development and law. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? By equipping small and solo firms with advanced drafting tools, EstateScribe expands access to high-quality estate planning for middle-class families, rural communities, and underserved regions that often lack affordable estate planning services. Our software enables attorneys who serve diverse demographics to increase capacity and reduce costs. We’re working on engagement with bar associations and are working with community-based practitioners to ensure that modern drafting tools are not limited to large or urban firms. Our goal is to democratize technology that historically required high overhead, expensive training, or large staff. Anything else you’d like us to know? EstateScribe was built because we lived the problem. As small business owners who learned to run and operate a law firm, we know how difficult, expensive, and time-consuming drafting and other manual workflows can be, and how deeply it affects access to estate planning nationwide. Our approach is not theoretical; it’s based on thousands of real client interactions. We believe estate planning is one of the most impactful areas of law, yet one of the most underserved by modern technology. EstateScribe is bringing true innovation to this critical practice area at a time when demand is rising, and attorney capacity is shrinking. Company Name Immediator Inc. Elevator Pitch Gut instinct, tradition, and billable hours currently drive the process in determining when to begin settlement negotiations in personal injury litigation. Immediator saves both sides time and money by applying data analytics to signal when settlement negotiations are likely to succeed. Developed by experts in law, data science, and insurance, Immediator is an AI-driven decision support tool that uses data, not speculation, to provide an objective method for evaluating optimal settlement timing. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litigation consumes time and money because decisions about when to negotiate settlement rely on instinct instead of statistical insight. Lawyers and insurers spend months debating when a case is ready to resolve, during which costs rise, reserves stay idle, and relationships strain under uncertainty. Immediator brings the discipline of data to the art of negotiation. Our neutral, AI-powered platform is the first of its kind because it provides an objective evidence-based measure of settlement readiness, a percentage we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), helping both sides know when it’s a fruitful time to begin negotiation. Built by litigators, claims professionals, and data scientists, Immediator applies secure, legally engineered analysis that protects privilege, safeguards data, and delivers clarity professionals can act on confidently. The result is faster settlements, lower costs, and smarter decisions. Unlike systems that manage files or scrape data to create documents, and unlike human mediators who rely on intuition, Immediator defines a new category— settlement intelligence. Immediator does the job of a human mediator. Unlike a human mediator who parachutes in after the close of discovery and the expenditure of massive amounts of litigation costs, Immediator goes to work even before the lawsuit is filed, comparing the parties’ alignment on key issues to signal when to begin settlement negotiations, even if the optimal time is before discovery closes. What problem does your product solve? There is no system that tells plaintiff lawyers and insurance companies the right moment to settle, so insurance defense lawyers end up controlling the timeline. Plaintiffs (and their lawyers) and insurance companies are aligned in their interest in keeping costs down and resolving cases sooner. Defense lawyers are paid by the hour. This misalignment of interests often leads to unnecessary delays, unnecessary litigation expenses, and 55% of claim dollars lost to transaction costs. Immediator is the solution. Immediator uses data to detect the right moment for settlement and triggers direct negotiation between plaintiffs and insurers, preventing months of avoidable billable hours and other potentially unnecessary litigation expenses. Who are your competitors? Immediator has no direct competitors other than traditional human mediators. Most emerging legal tech platforms focus on facilitating communication or expediting document preparation, not determining settlement readiness. Immediator’s differentiation lies in using data science to model alignment and readiness objectively, while safeguarding confidentiality and neutrality. Immediator’s closest B2B SaaS competitors are Bot Mediation, EvenUp, Riskonnect, and Discover Docket. None of these tools offers neutral, data-driven predictive analysis of optimal settlement timing. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zngh4I7VEbs. When was the company founded? 2025-06-27. Where is the company located? Savannah, Ga. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our target customers are liability insurers (and their adjusters) and personal injury (plaintiff) lawyers. The goal is to become the go-to platform for personal injury litigants by demonstrating time and cost savings for both sides. What is the price of your product or service? Immediator plans to charge an annual subscription fee per user and a separate charge per case/claim handled on the platform. The specific rates will be negotiated with the customers and subject to a specific user agreement. The prices will begin small, in order to build our customer base, and increase over time as our platform’s value to customers grows. Customers will be offered bundles to reduce cost. We anticipate that our product will become sticky, which will provide us with opportunities to expand our pricing to match its value. Tell us more about your traction. Every plaintiff lawyer we have spoken with is interested in the tool and many have become angel investors. We have reached out to one major liability insurance company so far (a company everyone would recognize by name and immediately know their slogan), and that company has expressed great interest. We are working on a pilot project with them for beta testing, data partnership, and ultimately as a future customer. The product is not yet ready for customers, so we have not pursued sales opportunities. We are focusing our energy on finishing the product and working with our interested partners. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Immediator plans a land and expand strategy. Initially, we will work to grow our customer base by selling the benefits of the platform to liability insurers, because Immediator ultimately has the potential to save insurance companies as much as 40% on their litigation costs, including hourly attorney fees and expenses. Plaintiff attorneys will be invited to the platform by the insurance companies. We plan to reach out to plaintiff lawyers independently to demonstrate the benefits and neutrality of Immediator. We will provide white glove service and inexpensive pricing to our initial customers so as to show them the value the product can add to their bottom line. We plan to offer software integration with the litigation tools already utilized by our customers so that adoption can be seamless. We will allow direct, encrypted communication and transmission of evidence and documents between the parties, with firewall protection preserving confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. The end goal is to make the platform so universally used and sticky that litigants and insurers cannot afford not to use it. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Two of Immediator’s four founders are women, and one is a U.S. military veteran. Maury Argento, a former captain in the U.S. Army, will be our CEO, and she has also served as our head of product development. Dr. Jill Ferdinands, our chief data scientist, created the algorithm we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), and she will lead the company as it refines its AI-driven model as more and more data are obtained and analyzed. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? The heart of Immediator is its neutrality. Rather than utilizing the good old boys’ network or defaulting to gut instinct, Immediator will be the first platform to bring hard science and numbers as the driving force behind the decision when to begin settlement negotiations. The vast majority of human mediators are men. Immediator was created by women to replace the old way of doing business with rationality, as opposed to emotion. Anything else you’d like us to know? Immediator was conceived by our co-founder, Jason Crawford. He represents catastrophically injured victims, and he has practiced for over 32 years. Over that time, he has watched his clients’ recoveries be consistently diminished because litigation is so expensive. His goal has always been to put more money in his clients’ pockets by being a good steward of their case expenses, and a dollar saved to a client is even better than a dollar added to the settlement because a percentage of the latter is shared with the plaintiff lawyer. Reduced litigation spending makes a real difference in personal injury victims’ lives, but it also adds to the bottom line of the insurance companies. Understanding this fundamental alignment of interests ultimately led to the creation of Immediator. It also helped that Jason was married to a Ph.D. who specializes in data science. Company Name Lawdify Elevator Pitch AI-native evidence analysis and claims preparation for construction disputes, akin to a contractor-side equivalent of what EvenUp does for PI plaintiffs. A contractor drops project materials (contracts, emails, daily logs). Lawdify OCRs, parses and organises everything by parties, dates and issues (delays, variations) and generates a claim (or defence) pack with a fact-checked timeline, a structured claim/response, and flags for weaknesses in evidence. What makes your company unique or innovative? We are building the first AI-native collaboration platform purpose-built for construction and infrastructure disputes, designed to create a true network effect across the entire ecosystem: downstream users like law firms and expert witness firms, midstream claims consultants, and upstream in-house contractor teams. What makes us different is that we have engineered Lawdify from day one to work for global projects. Founded in Singapore and now expanded into Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the U.K., and Dubai (with the US next), we have continuously tuned the platform to handle two realities that break most legal tech at scale: the idiosyncrasies of evidence across jurisdictions and the complexity of working across languages. At the core of the product is a dispute intelligence layer that turns project documentation into a living “Case Brain” of the contract: rights, obligations, and how they connect to change requests, time extension requests, and variations over the life of a project. Using graph and vector databases, we map and trace large volumes of evidence to claims, and track how the case narrative evolves over long time horizons. This gives teams a clearer, continuously updated view of what the contract says, what the evidence supports, and how the dispute is developing (across borders, languages, and stakeholders). We are the only AI tool with an Excel add-on that connects directly to the “Case Brain” behind the matter allowing for fact-checking massive spreadsheets (such as project schedules, progress logs, cost trackers, and payment applications) against thousands underlying emails, reports, meeting minutes, and other project records. What problem does your product solve? Lawdify solves the problem of inefficient, adversarial construction dispute resolution. Contractors often lose time, money, and margin due to poorly organised evidence, unclear claims, and late-stage legal intervention. Disputes cost the industry over $80 billion annually and take 13-18 months to resolve on average, driven largely by incomplete records, unsubstantiated claims, and poor contract compliance. By replacing fragmented workflows and costly legal prep with an AI-native, claims-ready workspace, Lawdify cuts down dispute resolution time, reduces legal fees, and gives contractors a faster, fairer path to resolving or avoiding disputes entirely. Who are your competitors? (Somewhat) Direct competitors: Indirect competitors in eDiscovery (Relativity, Everlaw, Reveal, Luminance) but they usually stop at review and only relevant when a construction claim has become a full-blown dispute rather than focus on dispute prevention and pre-dispute management. General copilots like MS Co-pilot, GPT Enterprise, Gemini Enterprise etc while they can draft claims given sufficient context, they are not really built to ingest and structure years of messy evidence. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/4lsf-J_K4lc. When was the company founded? 2023-09-09. Where is the company located? Singapore. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Law firms with construction disputes practice, claims consultants, and contractors. What is the price of your product or service? From $10K/year to $100K/year depending on size of the team, volume of documents, and complexity of the workflows. Tell us more about your traction. Working with some of the largest law firms in Asia specialized in complex and high value construction disputes, claims consultants, expert witness firms, and construction contractors. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1 (2025). We are growing Lawdify by tapping into disputes teams in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Japan that focus on high stakes disputes including construction. Year 2 (2026). We expand across APAC with law firm’s construction disputes and expand by pulling in the rest of the ecosystem on each matter (claims consultants, expert witnesses, and law firms) as collaborators on the same structured record, creating a network effect and repeatable referrals. We start US expansion focusing on mid-tier contractors. Year 3 (2027). We replicate this playbook to create the go-to platform for construction disputes with contractors based in the US that have global presence including in APAC. Year 4-5. We become the default disputes infrastructure for construction matters by standardizing these workflows across firms and experts, and extending from claims preparation into full-stack dispute handling (from intake through tribunal-ready filings) Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Eliza Jiang (CEO & co-founder): Chinese descent (Guangzhou native, native Cantonese and Mandarin speaker), culturally Latina since I grew up in Panama (Panamanian national, fluent/native Spanish speaker). First generation Chinese immigrant to Panama, first one to attend university in the family with international student financial aid. First lawyer/professional in the family and paid law school with scholarships and student loans. Lived and worked in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. Hong Kong permanent resident. Max Godoy (CTO & co-founder): Chilean national, grew up in the island of Chiloe in south of Chile, self taught coder and have been coding since 14. Trained as engineer and recruited by Singaporean aerospace engineering company. Lived in Asia, 2x startup founder of AI and blockchain analytics company. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Lawdify contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by expanding what “legal tech” serves and who it is built for. We are building from APAC outward for a global user base, not the other way around. That means supporting cross-border matters, multilingual evidence, and region-specific dispute processes so teams in markets that are often underserved by US-centric tools can still benefit from high-quality AI workflows. We also focus on a part of the legal ecosystem that is frequently left out of innovation: construction and infrastructure disputes, where outcomes affect livelihoods, public works, and small-to-mid-sized contractors. By making evidence organization, fact-checking, and claims preparation faster and more accessible, we help smaller teams (including boutiques and lean in-house groups) operate with capabilities that previously required large headcount and expensive systems. Finally, our collaboration approach brings together the full set of stakeholders on a matter (law firms, expert witnesses, claims consultants, and contractors) on a shared, structured record. That reduces information asymmetry and makes dispute work more transparent, consistent, and accessible across different teams, geographies, and working styles. Anything else you’d like us to know? We started a more general AI legal tech tool for disputes case preparation and have found a wedge and great use case in construction disputes, which is why we are doubling down on this industry. Company Name LawFi, Inc. Elevator Pitch LawFi offers flexible and customized legal fee financing options, allowing clients to access legal services while paying the costs over time. LawFi’s legal fee financing platform combines financial technology, a proprietary loan origination system, and utilizes AI to assess market and court data to determine the optimal term and loan amount for each matter. LawFi can approve a legal fee loan in minutes, not days or weeks. Now, lawyers can offer clients a better way to pay for legal services. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawFi is not a litigation funding provider investing in high-stakes contingency legal cases. LawFi is the first installment loan product specifically designed to finance legal service fees. Our proprietary AI-driven decision engine uses alternative data (employment, income, cash flow) to approve more clients, not just those with prime credit. We enable law firms to embed financing directly into their workflows, depositing funds directly into client trust accounts, transforming legal payments, and providing access to justice. What problem does your product solve? LawFi helps address the access-to-justice gap by enabling the 166 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck to afford legal representation. We remove financial barriers for clients who are either unable to pay upfront fees or prefer to finance their legal services, while ensuring that lawyers receive payment upfront. This approach increases the number of clients served and reduces receivables. Who are your competitors? Competitors include credit card companies, Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) providers, and general personal loan platforms. However, these traditional loan options are not tailored or customized for legal services. They do not underwrite the legal matter being financed, and often have higher costs, lower approval rates, and less flexible terms for legal matters. We differentiate ourselves from BNPL solutions targeting the legal market because (i) LawFi is the lender and underwriter; we are not simply a lead pass-through to a thrid-party BNPL underwriter or lender; (ii) Our technology enables us to approve a significantly higher percentage of applicants than BNPL solutions, by using open banking technology and cash flow underwriting allowing us to evaluate the ability to repay based on a broader range of factors; (iii) Our proprietary algorithms underwrite the legal matter being financed to establish what a matter should cost and the proper repayment terms based on the type of dispute, jurisdiction, market and court data; (iv) We provide law firms with an advanced platform and embedded finance tools and resources to quickly and easily add financing to their payment options; (v) LawFi has developed the first fully functional and bar complaint legal fee financing platform, not just a link found in a payment processor platform payout page; and (vi) Unlike a BNPL solution, LawFi has developed the first fully compliant refund policies that do not claw back fees or loan proceeds from law firms. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://bit.ly/lawfi_demo, Password: LegalFintech. When was the company founded? 2021-11-08. Where is the company located? LawFi is a remotely operated company with headquarters located in Jacksonville, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? LawFi customers include lawyers, law firms, and their clients (borrowers). LawFi can target the full spectrum of lawyers and law firms, from sole practitioners to large law firms. Our initial focus is on small to mid-sized law firms, solo practitioners, and their clients. We are targeting firms focused on serving the needs of individual consumers and small business owners, making loans for services in practice areas such as family law, trusts & estates, civil litigation, and other consumer-facing areas, as well as business law, transactions, and commercial litigation. What is the price of your product or service? LawFi legal merchant accounts are free to lawyers and law firms. We do not charge any set-up, implementation, or other subscription fees. Like other credit card networks, lenders, or BNPL financing options, LawFi only charges its law firm clients a Merchant Discount Rate (“MDR” or “financing fee”) on the total loan amount for the matters we finance after the firm has approved and accepted the financing and confirmed receipt of the funds in their account. Our fees range from 7.5% to 15% of the loan amount. Borrowers pay a fixed interest rate (significantly lower than other financing options) and a 2% loan origination fee, which is added to the loan amount and paid over the term of the loan. Tell us more about your traction. LawFi launched its platform in June 2025 at the 75th Annual Florida Bar Convention. We have developed a growing waitlist and have partnered with Cordell & Cordell, the nation’s largest family law firm, and others to offer our legal fee loans in a limited Florida rollout. We plan to expand the rollout across the entire state of Florida to complete our pilot program and then expand across the country. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. LawFi plans to scale nationwide by partnering with bank sponsors, credit unions, law firms, bar associations, legal payment processors, and other legal technology providers to expand its digital lending platform and AI-driven underwriting capabilities. We will continuously enhance our technology, broaden our network, and develop new products to support access to justice for millions of Americans. Have you received outside funding? Yes, LawFi has been capitalized to date by founders, friends, and family (angels), raising $3M in cash and significant non-cash contributions from team members. We are currently negotiating three term sheets for our first seed credit facility of $25 million, with an accordion feature to $150 million, to support our Florida pilot program. Additionally, we are preparing to launch our first institutional equity offering for between $5M and $10M. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LawFi’s leadership team comprises professionals from diverse backgrounds in legal, finance, technology, compliance, and operations, with experience spanning major fintech firms, law firms, and financial institutions. We emphasize building strong, inclusive, and equitable teams. Our current team includes minorities and women. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawFi’s mission is to make legal services financially accessible to all, especially middle-class Americans and those who are underserved. By bridging the Access to Justice Gap, we empower diverse communities to obtain legal representation. Anything else you’d like us to know? LawFi is the inventor of the Legal Fee Loan and the only company offering a proprietary legal fee lending platform purpose-built for the legal industry. Our technology is designed to transform the way legal services are paid for and accessed, ensuring that everyone can obtain legal services regardless of their financial situation. Company Name LawQi Elevator Pitch The AI transformation is underway. It is undeniable, and its impact will be enormous. The firms, bar associations and legal workplaces that develop the legal professionals who drive the transformation will thrive. The ones that hesitate will be stuck wondering how it all changed so fast. LawQi delivers what most AI training can’t: true literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. Affordably scalable for any organization, it equips the people who power competitive advantage. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawQi is where lawyers use AI to learn AI. Legal professionals build real competency through real work, not passive lectures or demonstrations. LawQi builds real AI competency. The first innovative differentiator is the learning method itself. The platform serves as both personal AI tutor and experimental workspace, where users master prompting techniques, test capabilities, and analyze documents in real-time through interactive discovery. This builds transferable skill and valuable AI understanding and intuition that works across any AI platform. Comprehensive modules cover AI fundamentals, advanced techniques, the tools landscape, and critical professional topics including liability and insurance coverage. Users navigate content at their own pace, and each lesson incorporates hands-on experimentation with immediate feedback to lock in and extend the learning. Core course material is supplemented by 100+ topic explainers in LawQi’s memory, drawn on to support answers and presented as clickable citation links when relevant to a learner’s conversation with the AI tutor. Our approach sidesteps the biggest pitfalls in AI training: LawQi delivers true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. The second innovative differentiator is the delivery model. A fully-managed, turn-key solution for bar associations, law firms and other organizations. Whether supporting larger initiatives or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. For lawyers in small firms, bar associations are the institutions legal professionals trust above even their firms to prepare them for an AI-powered future. However, smaller bar associations lack the time and funding to prepare their members for the AI transformation, and larger bar associations lack the capacity for dynamic delivery, timely content creation and agile platform integration of emerging models. Among firms, smaller and many mid-size firms lack dedicated training staff. Meanwhile larger firms implementing specialized tools are too stretched to provide foundational training for their broader workforce. Whether supplementing larger initiatives within a firm or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. The third innovative differentiator is the price. We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available. The final innovative differentiator is our foundation. We built LawQi as the evolution of our experience developing and supporting the “AI Academy” programs of the Ontario Bar Association and Canadian Bar Association. Our technology partnership with Praxis AI means we deliver our programming on award-winning platforms that are battle-tested across major universities and enterprises – a leading-edge stack that combines pedagogical excellence with enterprise-grade security and scalability, from an organization profiled by Anthropic and described by them as “leading the AI revolution in education.” Our foundation speaks to our ability to immediately accommodate ALL associations and firms recognizing the AI transformation now underway and the urgency of equipping the people who power their capacity to meet the moment. What problem does your product solve? Poor AI literacy and competency among lawyers is now an industry-scale problem, and it calls for an industry-scale response. LawQi is the only provider immediately capable of delivering baseline AI training at an industry scale. No amount of webinars, pilots or even firm-wide rollouts of legal AI products changes the fact that the rate of AI advancement means that all facets of legal knowledge work and practice will be impacted in unknown and unknowable ways throughout 2026 and beyond. While some lawyers, firms and legal organizations are at the vanguard, most are at the starting line, unaware that a race has even begun. We have an urgent, mass-education need and a dawning realization that our traditional thinking and approaches to technology training takes us in the wrong direction when it comes to AI. I’d go so far as to say that lawyers in particular have at most 12 months left to develop a holistic understanding of generative AI in the context of what it means for the practice of law and administration of justice before the window closes for good. That’s how fast AI is evolving. If we don’t act, we risk the majority of our AI learning opportunities being reduced to those focused on operating systems we didn’t design, managing processes we don’t understand, in a transformation we never guided. It doesn’t have to be that way. The ultimate trajectory will be of our own making, but our collective ability to guide the transformation means we need a critical mass with baseline understanding of how AI works now. We don’t have that baseline yet because legal AI advancement, innovation and adoption has been sparse, diffuse, and either seen as optional or for the foolhardy. Our institutions (firms, bar associations, courts and legal departments of all sorts) haven’t embraced meaningful full-firm, full-bar or full-org AI training to build that baseline. Indeed, before LawQi, it wasn’t even an option. It is now. Who are your competitors? All CLE providers, whether private, bar affiliated, non-profit or commercial, and whether targeting individuals, firms or bar associations. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/6uDpwAgxBqE. When was the company founded? 2025-05-06. Where is the company located? Ottawa, Ontario. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Bar associations (or similar) of any size (from small county to the largest state bars), firms and legal organizations of 50 FTE (all roles) or larger. Our offering is scalable to organizations of any size. What is the price of your product or service? We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available at higher price points. Tell us more about your traction. The first iteration developed for the benefit of the 16,000 member Ontario Bar Association (OBA) came in November 2024. Launched in beta as the “AI Academy,” it was conceived by Colin Lachance, then holding an appointment as the OBA Innovator-in-Residence, with a dual purpose of fulfilling his mandate to AI education for the OBA and for evaluating the potential of this particular learning approach. Following a content update and learning path refresh, its popularity among Ontario lawyers grew, as did demand from other Canadian jurisdictions for access. In July 2025, the 40,000 member Canadian Bar Association contracted with LawQi (the newly incorporated business that assumed management of the OBA AI Academy and now provides the distinct LawQi Global platform) to roll out the CBA AI Academy nationally (including assuming OBA’s financial responsibility for Ontario beyond the term of the prior arrangement). Throug the CBA, the AI Academy has been accredited for 2.75 hours of Ethics/Professionalism and 0.25 of substantive law. The commercial version of LawQi outside the ambit of the CBA relationship took shape over the early fall, with successful beta testing across multiple customer groups, and the go-to-market content and platform experience were finalized in early November 2025. Clients in pilots or anticipated to onboard in January/February 2025 include: placements at two national and three large regional law firms with a combined FTE of 4,000), state-wide availability to over 1500 team members across 50+ legal aid offices, roll-outs to teams of 50-100 of three different pro bono organizations in three different jurisdictions. Several other active client conversations likely to result in pilots or launches by the end of February include three state bars, two county bars, three trial lawyers associations and one legal insurance company (for the benefit of its insured attorneys). In addition, LawQi will be placed at no-charge in at least 3 law school classes. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our goal for 2026 is to serve as many lawyers as we can. In a recent “Lawyers who Learn” Lawline podcast, we talked about upskilling 100,000 attorneys by 2030, but we are confident that we can (and must) go well beyond that in just 2026 to build the baseline competency we believe the profession needs. That is our sole priority for 2026 and we will keep our offering and price points in line with that focus. Beyond 2026, consistent and vocal user feedback from among our AI Academy and LawQi base highlights the high demand for experiential training in other aspects of attorney work. Our relationship with Praxis AI also reveals a number of promising avenues for ultra-personalized learning, professional development and even practice activities. We will closely monitor user feedback as it relates to demand for those services and plan for product expansion beyond AI training in 2027. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. N/A. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawQi advances inclusion by partnering with bar associations – the institutions serving the entire legal profession, not just elite firms. Similarly, we also prioritize support of legal aid, pro bono and not-profit organizations through pricing our offerings to them at bar associations rather than law firm levels. Our bar association pricing – as low as $1 per member per year – makes professional-grade training accessible regardless of practice setting or resources. Solo practitioners, small firm lawyers, legal aid attorneys, and underserved communities access the same quality training as large corporate firms through their bar membership. This prevents a divide where only well-resourced organizations develop AI competencies while others fall behind. Bar associations serve diverse memberships across practice areas, geographic locations, and career stages. By empowering these trusted institutions to lead their members through the AI transformation, LawQi reaches the full spectrum of legal practice—from rural solo practitioners to urban specialists, from new lawyers to experienced practitioners transitioning to new technologies. The platform’s self-directed design accommodates diverse learning styles, experience levels, and schedules. Professionals navigate modules on fundamentals, advanced techniques, tools landscape, and critical professional topics at their own pace, removing one-size-fits-all constraints disadvantaging learners with different backgrounds or time availability. The embedded AI assistant provides personalized support, meeting users where they are rather than assuming baseline technical literacy. Legal professionals from non-technical backgrounds, different generations, or varied educational experiences all develop essential competencies—from prompting techniques to understanding liability implications—ensuring the entire legal community can participate in shaping the AI transformation of law.

Company Name LegalBridge Elevator Pitch LegalBridge is AI-powered case management built exclusively for immigration law firms. We automate the entire visa workflow: document categorization, cover letter drafting, recommendation letters, exhibit generation, form filling, client portals, case tracking, invoicing, and final export. Attorneys cut case prep time by 60% while doubling client capacity. Serving 70+ U.S. law firms, from solo practitioners to 20-attorney practices. What makes your company unique or innovative? LegalBridge is the only immigration case management platform with native AI across every workflow stage. Five core innovations set us apart: Unlike legacy platforms that digitize paper workflows, LegalBridge reimagines them. We built for AI-first, not AI-added. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys face a crushing operational burden. Preparing a single O-1A or EB-1A case requires organizing hundreds of documents, drafting 20-page cover letters, generating dozens of exhibit labels, filling government forms, and coordinating with clients, employers, and recommenders across time zones. Most firms rely on outdated software designed before modern AI existed. The result: paralegals spend 15+ hours per case on manual document organization. Attorneys write the same cover letter sections repeatedly. Client communications scatter across email, text, and phone calls. Form errors cause RFEs that delay approvals by months. LegalBridge solves this by consolidating every immigration workflow into one AI-powered platform. Document uploads auto-categorize. Drafts generate from templates trained on successful filings. Client portals centralize communication and document collection. Questionnaires pre-populate government forms. Exhibit lists generate and reorder with drag-and-drop. The outcome: attorneys handle 2x the caseload without adding headcount, case preparation time drops by 60%, and RFE rates decrease through AI-driven consistency checks. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include INS Zoom, Docketwise, Cerenade and E-Immigration. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/RG2UySU8K5k?si=l8nL4qzz9I276XBT. When was the company founded? 2023-11-03.

Open APIs for integration with practice management, HRIS, and government filing systems. Build template marketplace. Expand AI capabilities to predict case outcomes and recommend evidence strategies. Target: $10M+ ARR, 2,000+ law firms globally. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LegalBridge is founded and led by immigrants. Our leadership team represents India’s technology and startup ecosystem, bringing firsthand understanding of the immigration challenges we solve. The company includes team members from multiple backgrounds, gender identities, and regions across India and the U.S. Diversity is embedded into our lived experience and our product vision immigration is our founders’ personal story, not just a market opportunity. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LegalBridge actively supports the immigrant founder and legal tech communities from diverse background through several initiatives: We host events for our community of 20,000+ immigrant founders and professionals, creating networking opportunities and sharing immigration knowledge freely. These events connect entrepreneurs navigating their own visa journeys with attorneys who can help. Our pricing structure democratizes access to advanced technology. Solo practitioners and small firms pay $5,000/year, receiving the same AI capabilities that larger firms access. This ensures immigration attorneys serving underrepresented communities can compete with well-resourced practices. We partner with immigration attorneys who serve asylum seekers, DACA recipients, and other vulnerable populations, offering discounted access to ensure technology reaches those handling the most critical cases. As immigrant founders building for immigration law, we are committed to ensuring this practice area, which directly shapes who gets to participate in American society, has access to the best possible technology. Anything else you’d like us to know? LegalBridge exists because three immigrants decided the system that shaped their lives deserved better technology. We built every feature immigration attorneys actually need: AI document categorization, document chat, client collaboration portals, AI-drafted cover letters and recommendation letters, drag-and-drop exhibit lists, email questionnaires, automated form filling, final export, case status tracking, one-click invoicing, and one-click retainer generation. One platform. No juggling systems. We bootstrapped without outside funding because we wanted to build for customers, not investors. Every feature exists because an immigration attorney told us they needed it. The immigration legal market remains underserved. Legacy vendors carry decades of technical debt. New entrants bolt AI onto old architectures. LegalBridge is AI-native from day one. We are profitable, growing, and obsessed with making immigration attorneys more effective. TECHSHOW recognition would accelerate our mission and introduce LegalBridge to firms still struggling with fragmented, outdated tools. We would be honored to demonstrate how AI transforms immigration law practice. Company Name Litmas Inc. Elevator Pitch Litmas is an AI powered tool designed specifically for litigation attorneys that digitizes the workflows litigators use to move a case through the litigation process, in one unified platform. Litmas AI enables attorneys to responsibly draft motions, pleadings, discovery documents, organize evidence and conduct in-context verifiable case law research. This combination of AI enhanced workflows results in substantial time savings and greater accuracy and visibility. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litmas AI is built for litigation, not general legal work. It connects facts, evidence, and case law into one drafting workflow instead of producing free form AI text. Every result is thoroughly traceable to source documents and cited authority, so attorneys can verify accuracy instantly. This makes Litmas usable in real litigations, where mistakes and hallucinated citations are unacceptable. What problem does your product solve? Litigation work is slow and manual. Attorneys repeatedly draft similar motions, pull facts from scattered documents, and double check research under deadline pressure. Generic AI tools make this worse by hallucinating case law and forcing lawyers to verify every single output. Litmas solves this by connecting facts, evidence, and precedent into a single workflow, reducing drafting time while maintaining professional reliability. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include traditional legal research platforms such as Westlaw and Lexis, AI assisted drafting tools, and newer AI legal assistants such as Spellbook or Clearbrief. These products either focus primarily on research, provide general AI chat experiences, or address isolated drafting tasks. Litmas differs by combining motion drafting, evidence organization, and case law application into a single litigation focused workflow. with fully sourced outputs designed for use in active cases. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://litmas.ai/video-overview/. When was the company founded? 2025-07-14. Where is the company located? Wilmington, Del.

Demand is driven primarily through inbound marketing, with strong early engagement from power users who rely on Litmas AI for active cases. Litmas AI is deep in talks with several AM 100 firms for piloting the platform. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Litmas AI is currently live in all 50 states. Over the coming years, Litmas AI will deepen its existing coverage by extending its library of litigation documents and improving its proprietary motion drafting and evidence mapping workflows. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Litmas is built by a globally distributed team with diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. Our team includes former litigators, appellate attorneys, AI researchers, and engineers based across multiple regions and countries. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Litmas AI gives smaller firms and contingency based practices access to advanced litigation technology that has traditionally been available only to large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? Litmas was built based on practicing litigators input and logic every step of the way and is used daily on real life litigation cases throughout the country, today. Company Name PowerPatent Inc. Elevator Pitch PowerPatent is an AI co‑pilot for patent lawyers that turns invention disclosures and drawings into near‑ready patent applications in minutes. It automates first drafts, checks consistency between claims, spec, and figures, and flags patentability risks so firms can file stronger patents faster, increase flat‑fee margins, and free attorneys to focus on strategy, not slog work. What makes your company unique or innovative? PowerPatent is unique because it combines a highly automated, “full‑spec in minutes” drafting engine with built‑in diagnostics that continuously check quality, consistency, and patentability while you work.​ End‑to‑end AI drafting co‑pilot. Unlike tools that only help with snippets or templates, PowerPatent can generate background, summary, detailed description, and even claims from disclosures, figures, and part lists in a single, guided flow.​ The system is designed so attorneys start from an almost complete draft, then refine and strategize, instead of building the application from scratch.​ Embedded quality and risk checks. PowerPatent layers in AI‑powered consistency checks, functional‑claim analysis, and automated cross‑referencing between claims, spec, and drawings to catch gaps and ambiguities that weaken enforceability.​ It also uses prior‑art and Section 103 conflict prediction signals to highlight potential patentability issues early, making the drafting process more strategic, not just faster.​ Workflow and ecosystem integration. The platform integrates drafting, review, docketing, and USPTO Private PAIR connectivity, so firms do not have to juggle separate tools for composition, checking, and prosecution.​ Cloud collaboration features let inventors and attorneys co‑develop drafts, with AI suggesting additional embodiments and variations to broaden protection and reduce design‑around risk.​ What problem does your product solve? PowerPatent solves the problem that patent drafting and prosecution work in law firms is slow, labor-intensive, and margin‑compressed, by automating first‑draft generation and routine prosecution tasks so attorneys can spend more time on strategy and client counseling.​ Core problems for law firms Traditional patent drafting requires many hours of manual background, claim, and detailed description drafting per case, limiting throughput and making flat or capped fee work less profitable.​ Attorneys and staff lose time to repetitive tasks such as reusing boilerplate, aligning specs and drawings, and ensuring formality compliance across multiple jurisdictions, which increases turnaround time and risk of error.​ How PowerPatent addresses them For drafting, PowerPatent’s AI co‑pilot turns an attorney’s input (claims, invention summary, drawings/part lists) into a comprehensive first draft in minutes, including background and detailed description sections aligned with the figures.​ For prosecution, PowerPatent supports the full patent lifecycle by first turning raw invention disclosures into high‑quality, consistent applications that are easier to prosecute efficiently and strategically. During prosecution, it tracks office actions, automates responses, and surfaces metrics so teams can control cost and maximize term and portfolio strength. Once assets are granted, the platform helps map patents to products and markets, inform valuation and monetization strategies, and then periodically flag low‑value or non‑core assets for pruning using portfolio views and AI‑driven keep‑vs‑drop analysis.​ The system analyzes large patent datasets to propose accurate, guideline‑compliant language and structure, reducing drafting errors and downstream prosecution rework while allowing lawyers to focus on tailoring claims and legal strategy.​ Impact on law‑firm economics By compressing drafting time and automating low‑value steps, firms can increase associate productivity, handle more matters per attorney, and make fixed‑fee patent work more scalable and profitable.​ Cloud collaboration and workflow features let distributed teams and outside counsel iterate on drafts faster, improving responsiveness to clients and shortening time to filing without adding headcount.​ Who are your competitors? PowerPatent competes in the AI patent‑drafting/prosecution‑support space with a large and fast‑growing field of tools.​ Direct AI drafting competitors: DeepIP (formerly Davinci)​, Rowan Patents​, Dolcera IP Author​, ClaimMaster (AI‑assisted drafting and proofreading)​, Qatent​​, IP Author/IP Author.ai, Patently Create​, ipagent.ai​, PatentGPT​, XLSCOUT Drafting LLM​, Paximal​, Added Matter​.

For enterprise price please call 669-2323440 Tell us more about your traction. Law‑firm and investor traction: PatentPC uses PowerPatent to streamline drafting and prosecution on active client matters, validating that the workflows support sophisticated U.S. practice and flat‑fee economics.​ Tran.vc applies PowerPatent across a growing portfolio of AI, robotics, and deep‑tech startups, demonstrating scalability from single cases to multi‑asset portfolios.​ Inventiv channels early‑stage founders into the platform, showing that it can compress time from disclosure to filing and support monetization‑driven IP decisions.​ In‑house corporate traction. Cisbay, Micronoc, Monolithic 3D, and IntraAction use PowerPatent in‑house to draft, refine, and manage patent filings more efficiently than with outside counsel alone, using automation to cut cost while maintaining attorney‑level quality.​ These internal deployments show that the platform works not only for law firms but also for lean corporate IP teams that need repeatable workflows for drafting, prosecution metrics, and portfolio pruning. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. PowerPatent plans to grow over the next five years by deepening product capabilities across the patent lifecycle, expanding into more practice settings (firms, in‑house, and government), and building a partner ecosystem that drives distribution and data advantages.​ Product expansion. PowerPatent will evolve from “AI drafting co‑pilot” into a full lifecycle platform covering invention capture, drafting, prosecution analytics, portfolio valuation, monetization, and pruning. The roadmap emphasizes more domain‑specialized AI models, richer automation for office‑action responses, and tools that tie patents directly to products, revenue, and risk so legal teams can make board‑level decisions from within the product.​ Go‑to‑market and customer segments. Growth will focus on three core segments: patent boutiques and mid‑size firms doing flat‑fee work; in‑house teams at IP‑intensive startups and growth companies; and eventually larger enterprises and public‑sector organizations that need scalable IP workflows. Channels will include direct sales to firms, partnerships with VC funds and incubators (leveraging Tran.vc and similar relationships), and integrations with existing IP management and docketing systems to reduce switching friction.​ Data, ecosystem, and defensibility. Over five years, PowerPatent aims to compound its data advantage by learning from anonymized drafting and prosecution outcomes to continuously improve drafting quality, claim strategy suggestions, and keep‑vs‑drop recommendations. The company will also pursue alliances with search, analytics, and IP valuation providers, positioning PowerPatent as the drafting and decision‑making layer that sits on top of the broader patent data ecosystem.​ Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. PowerPatent is led and staffed mainly by minorities, with a founding and core team that is Asian and African Americans, bringing perspectives that are historically underrepresented in both legal tech and the patent profession. This diversity shows up not only in ethnicity, but also in career background, combining patent attorneys, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have navigated immigration, first‑generation professional, and cross‑border innovation ecosystems. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? PowerPatent contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by putting minority founders, inventors, and patent attorneys at the center of its product and ecosystem. The company is led and staffed entirely by minorities (Asian and African), and it actively mentors and trains underrepresented founders, students, and junior practitioners on how to use AI to access high‑quality patent protection without needing a large‑firm budget. PowerPatent also collaborates with minority‑owned firms, diverse startup ecosystems, and global technical communities, ensuring that voices from outside the traditional AmLaw and BigTech corridors help shape how AI is applied to patents and IP strategy. Anything else you’d like us to know? PowerPatent is built by practicing patent attorneys and engineers who live the daily realities of drafting, prosecution, and portfolio strategy, so the product is grounded in real‑world workflow and ethics rather than hype. The team is already embedded in the legal community through teaching, mentoring founders, and speaking on AI and patents, and views ABA TECHSHOW as a long‑term partnership opportunity to help solo, small, and mid‑size firms safely adopt generative AI. PowerPatent is committed to transparent, human‑in‑the‑loop use of AI, clear data‑handling practices, and continuous feedback from practitioners so that automation strengthens, rather than erodes, professional judgment and access to high‑quality patent representation.

Five-Year Growth Strategy for SayWell: Phase 1: Validation & Integration (Year 1). Phase 2: Product Scale and Evolution (Year 2). Phase 3: Market Leadership (Years 3–5). Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Well it’s really just me right now so I guess that inherently means zero diversity. 🙂 Kidding aside, I would say my background as a non-attorney with a product background from customer facing retail is generally diverse vs the traditional players in this market. Outside, customer-centered focus -> innovation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We are based in the heart of Atlanta which is extremely diverse and my office is a tech co-working space that is surrounded by diversity. I will likely hire from within this talent pool as we grow. Anything else you’d like us to know? I’m a father of two awesome kids that recently stepped away from a 20-year corporate career with The Home Depot with the last 15 years focusing on leading product management teams. I’ve had a long passion for wanting to solve customer problems and having gone through my own recent divorce I spotted an opportunity to make an impactful change. SayWell is taking a fundamentally different approach to improving coparent communication (and the fallout that lawyers ultimately deal with). The legacy providers try to stop parental fighting by documentation and eventual hand slapping. SayWell is an in-conversation moderator positioned to make a real impact on co-parents lives. Company Name SecureSplit. Elevator Pitch SecureSplit is an AI powered divorce financial platform for family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. We replace spreadsheets and email with a single workflow for client intake, organizing income, expenses, assets, and debts, running state specific support and property division calculations, and producing clean, court ready financial reports that save time and reduce costly errors. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most tools in family law focus on documents, not the numbers. SecureSplit is built for the financial side of divorce, from intake to court ready reports, in one browser-based workflow. Both spouses enter data once, the system standardizes it, runs state specific support and division calculations, and flags gaps or inconsistencies with AI assisted checks. It is collaborative, multi state, and API ready, so firms can plug a modern divorce financial engine into the rest of their legal tech stack. What problem does your product solve? Divorce lawyers, mediators, and CDFAs are stuck juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, email, and outdated calculators to make financials court ready. This manual, fragmented workflow is slow, error prone, and hard to delegate, which drives up costs and stress for clients. SecureSplit solves this by turning messy inputs from both spouses into a single structured dataset so professionals can run support and division calculations and generate clean reports in a few clicks. Who are your competitors? Our main competitors are legacy divorce financial tools like Family Law Software, DissoMaster, and other state specific support calculators, plus the “DIY stack” of Excel, PDFs, and email that firms still rely on. We compete by offering a single, modern workflow that covers intake, calculations, and reports in one place. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://securesplit.com/investor-page When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Newark, Del., HQ; San Diego, Calif. and Greensboro, N.C. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary target is solo and small to mid-sized family law firms, mediators, and divorce focused financial professionals (CDFAs and RIAs). Over time, we will expand to larger firms and law departments, but our initial focus is on the teams that live in the day-to-day financial details of divorce and need a faster, more standardized workflow. What is the price of your product or service? We use a tiered subscription model. Professional plans for firms, mediators, and CDFAs start around $100 dollars per professional per month, with premium and enterprise pricing based on seats, features, and overall size of the firm. The consumer version is offered as a separate low-cost monthly subscription on essentials.securesplit.com. Tell us more about your traction. We are currently pre revenue with approximately 50 professional customers using SecureSplit on live divorce matters, including family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. Usage is growing through referrals and a waitlist of additional firms, and we are seeing strong engagement and feedback through regular product sessions and Fireside Chats as we prepare for full launch. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, we will grow SecureSplit by first converting our current professional users into paying subscribers and deepening adoption within their firms. In the near term, we are focused on launching in a small set of key states, refining our core workflows through design partnerships with family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs, and adding integrations to the legal tech tools they already use. As we prove retention and unit economics, we will expand to additional states, introduce premium and enterprise tiers, and develop advanced AI assisted modeling and reporting. Longer term, we will scale through channel partnerships, education and certification programs for divorce professionals, and a complementary consumer product that feeds organized cases directly into our professional network. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is gender diverse and comes from different professional and cultural backgrounds, spanning financial planning, divorce practice, AI, and customer experience.

We design SecureSplit to lower the financial and technical barriers that keep many families from getting quality help. By standardizing the numbers work, we make it easier for smaller, community focused firms and solo mediators to serve clients who have been historically underrepresented or priced out of traditional advice. We are also building a diverse network of testers and advisors, including women led and minority led practices, and we intentionally use plain language, accessible UX, and remote friendly onboarding so a wide range of professionals can participate in and benefit from the legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? SecureSplit is at a pivotal stage, with a functional beta in use by about 50 professional users and a broader launch ahead. We are actively seeking design partners among family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs who want to modernize the numbers side of divorce. If selected, we will demo live case workflows, share lessons from 20 years in divorce focused financial planning, and show a clear path from spreadsheets to a modern standard for financial disclosures. Company Name Simone. Elevator Pitch Simone Reception is an AI-powered virtual receptionist built exclusively for law offices. It answers every call instantly with a calm, professional, human-like voice, gathers intake and conflict-check information, and routes calls intelligently. Clients call when life happens. Simone will be there to answer. What makes your company unique or innovative? Simone is unique because it is built exclusively for law firms and designed around legal realities, not generic AI use cases. Unlike traditional virtual reception or generic AI voice tools, Simone is purpose-built for legal intake. It understands the structure of law firms, the importance of conflict checks, confidentiality, ethical boundaries, and the difference between a new lead, an existing client, a court, or an opposing party. Simone is not just answering calls. It is executing legal-specific workflows. It gathers structured intake data, captures names for conflict searches, routes urgency intelligently, and integrates directly into tools like Clio and HubSpot so information is immediately usable, not buried in voicemail or transcripts. What makes Simone truly innovative is balance. It delivers 24/7 responsiveness for clients while protecting lawyer focus and wellbeing. Clients get a calm, professional first voice when life happens. Lawyers and their staff get fewer interruptions, better data, and control over when and how humans step in. Finally, Simone improves over time. As a firm evolves, Simone adapts to its language, services, and priorities, becoming a smarter front door rather than a static receptionist. In short, Simone brings enterprise-grade AI capability to small and mid-sized law firms in a way that is ethical, controlled, and deeply practical. What problem does your product solve? Simone solves the problem of missed calls, interrupted work, and poor first impressions in law firms. Legal problems do not arise on a schedule. Clients often call when they are stressed, anxious, or in crisis, and many of those calls happen outside office hours or when staff are unavailable. When calls go to voicemail, firms lose potential clients, create frustration, and miss critical information. At the same time, answering every call pulls lawyers and staff away from higher-value work and contributes to burnout. Research on workplace interruptions shows that when professionals are pulled away from focused work, it takes an average of over 20 minutes to fully regain concentration. In legal practice, where work is complex and high-stakes, frequent call interruptions quietly erode productivity, accuracy, and wellbeing. Simone reduces that hidden cost by answering calls without breaking lawyer focus. Simone solves this by ensuring every call is answered instantly, professionally, and consistently, 24/7. It captures structured intake and conflict-check information, routes urgency appropriately, and integrates directly into firm systems so nothing is lost or delayed. Simone recognizes that every call is not a 1-minute interruption but a 20-minute productivity hit. The result is a better client experience, fewer interruptions for legal teams, improved lead capture, and a calmer, more sustainable way for law firms to stay responsive without being always on. Who are your competitors? AI Reception services (i.e. CasefloodAI), Live Virtual Reception services (i.e. SmithAI, Ruby, LexReception), Generic AI Voice or Call-Handling platforms (i.e. Google Voice, Twilio), and In-House Reception or Voicemail Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-10-01. Where is the company located? Toronto, Ontario, Canada Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small, medium and large law firms. Legal Aid and pro bono services. What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $250 per month. Tell us more about your traction Our traction is early, but it is real and practitioner-led. Simone Reception is currently being actively used and tested inside a live law office environment (Evolve Family Law). We are not building this in isolation. It is operating in real conditions, handling real client calls, and being refined based on day-to-day legal workflows. We have validated three key things already: Our immediate traction focus is deliberate. We are prioritizing product quality, ethical guardrails, and legal-specific workflows before scaling sales. The next phase is converting this validated internal use into a structured beta with a small group of law firms, followed by broader commercial rollout. In short, Simone is already proving value inside a real law office, replacing existing paid solutions, and generating strong early demand. We are building on a foundation of real usage, not assumptions. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our five-year growth plan is deliberate, phased, and grounded in how law firms actually adopt technology. Year 0–1: Product excellence and focused market entry Our priority is to become the best AI receptionist in the legal market, not the fastest-growing generic tool. We will focus on small and mid-sized law firms in Canada and the US, refining Simone Reception through real-world use, structured pilots, and early paying customers. During this phase, we will deepen legal-specific workflows, expand integrations with core legal platforms, and build a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and ethical design. Growth will be steady and intentional, driven by referrals, conferences, and partnerships rather than aggressive sales tactics. Years 1–3: Geographic expansion and platform maturity. Once Simone Reception is proven and stable at scale, we will expand more aggressively across North America, Europe and Australia. This includes deeper US market penetration, multilingual support, and stronger relationships with legal software providers. At this stage, Simone becomes not just a receptionist, but a trusted front door for law firms, handling intake, triage, scheduling, and payments in a way that feels seamless and human. Years 3–4: Product expansion within the Simone ecosystem. With a strong customer base and mature core product, we will expand beyond reception into adjacent AI agents designed specifically for law firms. These may include intake specialists, internal assistants, and client communication agents, all built on the same ethical and legal-first foundation. Existing customers become the primary growth engine, adopting additional Simone products rather than churning to competitors. Years 4–5: Enterprise adoption and global reach. By year five, Simone will be positioned as a category-defining legal AI platform. We will pursue enterprise partnerships with larger firms, legal networks, and professional service providers, while expanding into additional jurisdictions where legal workflows are similar. At this stage, Simone will be deeply embedded into law firm operations, with strong recurring revenue, high retention, and a brand associated with trust, calm, and professionalism. Throughout all five years, our guiding principle remains constant: We grow by solving real problems, protecting lawyer wellbeing, and improving the client experience, not by chasing hype or replacing humans for its own sake. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is diverse in professional background, geography, and perspective, which directly strengthens how we build and grow Simone Reception. Beau Atkins — Legal and Founder Perspective Beau is a practicing family law attorney and CEO of a tech-forward law firm in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He founded Evolve Family Law with a focus on modern, client-centric legal services and technology integration, and he actively serves on legal innovation and technology committees. This gives Simone deep insights into legal workflows, ethical standards, client anxiety, and the real pain points lawyers and their clients experience with intake and reception. Beau’s lived experience as a lawyer driving process innovation directly informs how Simone is designed to support legal professionals. Sanjay Khandor — Entrepreneurial and Operational Leadership Sanjay brings entrepreneurial and business leadership grounded in technology delivery and growth. Based in Toronto, he has led ventures in digital services and operations, demonstrating success in building and scaling companies. His experience expanding businesses into new markets—including cross-border expansion efforts—enables strategic growth planning for Simone. Av Utukuri — Technical and Product Technology Leadership Av is a seasoned technologist with decades of experience in software and product development across digital systems, hardware, and embedded technologies. His background spans engineering, product strategy, and technology innovation, which positions Simone to deliver a robust, secure, scalable AI platform tailored to legal use cases. Geographic and Professional Diversity The leadership spans multiple regions of Canada, from Alberta to the Greater Toronto Area, bringing different market perspectives. This geographic spread helps Simone understand both regional legal practices and major urban legal tech ecosystems. The team bridges front-line legal practice, entrepreneurial business strategy, and deep technical execution, which is a rare combination in legal tech startups. Diversity of Experience and Perspective We come from distinct professional paths ranging from law practice, technology innovation, and entrepreneurial operations. These differences mean Simone is shaped by varied and multidisciplinary viewpoints, not a single discipline or worldview, and the product is informed by real users (lawyers and clients) and real technical constraints (secure, compliant systems). Each founder contributes a unique lens on problem solving, and that blend produces a more thoughtful, usable, and ethically grounded AI reception product. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Simone contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access, reducing bias at the first point of contact, and supporting healthier ways of practicing law. First, Simone expands access to legal services by ensuring that every call is answered professionally, regardless of when it comes in. Many people reach out to law firms during moments of stress, crisis, or vulnerability, often outside traditional office hours. By being available 24/7, Simone helps ensure that people who cannot call during business hours are still heard and treated with respect. Second, Simone is designed to reduce bias at the front door of the legal system. Human reception, while valuable, can be influenced by fatigue, assumptions, or unconscious bias. Simone delivers a consistent, calm, and professional experience to every caller, regardless of accent, background, or emotional state. Built-in multilingual and accent support further improves accessibility for clients who may otherwise struggle to communicate clearly or feel understood. Third, Simone supports inclusion within the profession itself. Smaller firms, rural practices, and solo lawyers often lack the resources to provide round-the-clock reception or advanced intake systems. Simone gives these firms access to enterprise-level capabilities without requiring large teams or overhead, helping level the playing field between small and large firms. Finally, Simone contributes to a more sustainable and humane legal tech ecosystem by protecting lawyer and staff wellbeing. By reducing constant interruptions and after-hours pressure, Simone helps create healthier work environments. A more sustainable profession is one that can retain diverse talent over time, rather than burning people out. In short, Simone promotes inclusion by improving access for clients, consistency and fairness at intake, and sustainability for legal professionals, all while being built intentionally for the realities of legal practice. Anything else you’d like us to know? Yes. Simone was built by practitioners, not observers. This product emerged from real frustration inside a working law office and has been shaped through live use, not hypothetical workflows. We are intentionally building slowly and responsibly, with a focus on trust, ethics, and real-world impact rather than hype or speed alone. We believe AI in law should reduce stress, improve access, and support healthier professional lives. Simone is our contribution to that vision, and we are committed to building it thoughtfully, transparently, and in partnership with the legal community. Company Name AutoDox Co., Ltd. Elevator Pitch While everyone builds chatbots, Sonar solves the real pain: formatting. Every lawyer knows the frustration: you inherit a document from a colleague, and spend the next hours fighting with the ruler, restarting numbering for the tenth time, or succumbing to the format painter’s dark arts. Sonar eliminates the pain with one click. Your house styles, applied instantly, perfectly, inside Microsoft Word. What makes your company unique or innovative? (1) Formatting-First Philosophy: Legal Tech goes AI-first. Sonar goes formatting-first. We’re the only legal tech solution that fully automates document formatting end-to-end—the bottleneck everyone feels but nobody addresses. (2) Built Under Constraint, Built to Last: We launched in Thailand with zero legal tech infrastructure, no VC funding, and legal teams operating on razor-thin margins who demanded results from day one – not vague promises of efficiency gains. These constraints forced us to build leaner and smarter than well-funded competitors. What started as a limitation became our edge: enterprise-grade capabilities at a fraction of the cost, designed for real lawyers with real budgets doing real work. What problem does your product solve? (1) The Formatting Bottleneck: Legal work demands perfect formatting, but achieving it manually is brutally time-consuming. Nobody wants to deliver a poorly formatted document to the client, so lawyers spend hours fighting with the numbering ribbon, the ruler, and the format painter, trying to push a paragraph exactly 0.1 inches to the left, or fix that paragraph number that won’t fix itself despite clicking “Restart at 1” fifty times. Unlike knowledge gaps that disproportionately affect juniors, formatting is the great equalizer: it wastes everyone’s time, period. A senior partner at 2 AM before a client deadline faces the same broken numbering as a first-year associate, and there’s no way to delegate it to a secretary or junior. (2) The Broader Workflow Crisis Beyond formatting, legal workflows break down in predictable ways. Junior lawyers doing first-pass redlines without access to the firm’s best precedents. Teams rely on manual error checks that inevitably miss critical issues. Expertise remains trapped in senior lawyers’ experience rather than codified in playbooks anyone can follow. Each inefficiency compounds, turning substantive legal work into administrative chaos. Sonar tackles both problems head-on. First, formatting: we instantly reformat entire documents to match any house style. Second, workflow: our complete suite handles definition tracking, redlines, error checks, playbooks, automations inside Microsoft Word, and an Outlook integration that enables seniors to teach juniors to write professional emails. All of this lives where you work – natively in Word and Outlook. Just open Word, launch Sonar, work smarter. Who are your competitors? Document Formatting: No direct competitors. We’re the only solution that fully automates legal document formatting end-to-end. However, given our broad suite (Word, Outook, Web), we operate in competitive spaces with several established platforms, including: Definitions/Error Checks: Contract Companion (Litera), Definely, LawVu Draft (formerly ClauseBase). AI Drafting/Redlining: Luminance, Litera One, Spellbook, DraftWise, GC AI, and a new one launching every Tuesday. AI Legal Assistant (Legal Research, Workflows, Tabular Reviews): Harvey, Legora, Midpage, DeepJudge. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/HmeX8E8XKSI. When was the company founded? 2023-04-09. Where is the company located? Bangkok, Thailand. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? In-house legal departments of all sizes, small to mid-size law firms What is the price of your product or service? We offer a generous free-forever tier with no credit card required. Paid plans start at $49/month for solo practitioners and scale to $79/month for unlimited usage. Custom enterprise pricing is available for corporate clients and larger teams. Tell us more about your traction. Successful implementations (selection): Law Firm: A leading international law firm in Southeast Asia chose Sonar Legal after evaluating multiple legal tech vendors. In-House: The legal department of Thailand’s largest conglomerate selected Sonar Legal following a comprehensive pilot and evaluation. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We’re currently a team of seven in Bangkok, with proven traction at both ends of the market. Our next phase focuses on deepening Southeast Asian presence while preparing for international expansion. We’ll grow the team to 20 by the end of 2026, adding dedicated sales and customer success roles to convert our pipeline and support enterprise accounts. Revenue from regional clients will fund controlled expansion into markets with similar pain points: starting with Singapore and Hong Kong, where international firms already recognize the formatting problem. By 2027, we’ll leverage these reference clients to enter the US and UK markets, where legal tech budgets are larger but the core frustration is identical. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Sonar Legal was born diverse. Greek and Thai co-founders, 50% female leadership, team spanning Europe and Southeast Asia with experience in US, EU, and Thai legal systems. Five people, multiple jurisdictions, different legal traditions and cultures shaping everything we build. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Sonar Legal democratizes access to advanced legal AI through a generous free-forever tier and pricing starting at $49/month. This makes enterprise-level capabilities accessible to solo practitioners, small firms, and underrepresented legal professionals traditionally priced out of premium technology.2. Education & Awareness in Developing Markets. Our founders are actively promoting legal tech adoption in Southeast Asia through guest lectures at ASEAN universities, preparing the next generation of lawyers for an AI-powered legal landscape. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name StreamSettle, Inc. Elevator Pitch We believe that if negotiating parties have a safe place to be reasonable, they will be. StreamSettle is a secure platform that instantly resolves cases by acting as a triple-blind “deal detector.” Both sides confidentially input their true settlement threshold. Our system detects if an overlap exists. If it does, the claim settles automatically at the midpoint. If no overlap, the data remains hidden, and no fees are charged, making StreamSettle truly risk-free for both sides. What makes your company unique or innovative? What problem does your product solve? The core problem is that offers and demands are unreliable data points. In an effort to gain leverage, both sides routinely exaggerate their positions. They then rely on this flawed data to answer a critical question: “Can this case settle?” When the gap between these postured numbers is wide, parties falsely conclude they are “too far apart.” This forces them into years of costly, unnecessary litigation to reach a settlement result that likely existed from the start. It is a classic case of “garbage in, garbage out” – bad data drives efficient markets into expensive gridlock. Who are your competitors? Direct Competitors (Automated Negotiation): Indirect Competitors: Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex6EHDV-l0U. When was the company founded? 2022-10-29. Where is the company located? Cypress, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? We target a two-sided market: 1. The “Demand” Side: Plaintiff law firms. These range from large “billboard” firms with thousands of active files to mid-sized litigation boutiques and solo firms. These firms are motivated by cash flow velocity and reducing their own overhead costs per case. 2. The “Supply” Side: Insurers & Defense law firms: We target Claims Directors cutting LAE, and forward-thinking Defense Partners who differentiate themselves by offering clients (insurers or self-insured businesses) speedy, efficient resolution. What is the price of your product or service? We operate on a Risk-Free Success Fee model. We charge a fee only if a settlement is reached on the platform. Fee: 1% of the total settlement amount per party. Cap: Maximum fee of $1,000 per party ($2,000 total per case). We plan to raise the cap as we scale, except for our early adopters. No Upfront Costs: There are no subscription fees, setup costs, or charges for testing thresholds that do not result in a deal. Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Years 1-2: The Texas Beachhead (Density Phase): Year 3: Product Expansion (Stickiness Phase): Years 4-5: National Scale (Expansion Phase): Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. StreamSettle is proudly woman-co-founded and led (Chrysa Jones, COO) and veteran-founded (Joe Jones, CEO, Marine Corps Veteran). Beyond the founders, we have intentionally built a diverse Advisory Board to ensure our product serves the entire legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know? We are not just a software company; we are building the settlement infrastructure of the future. Beyond our direct users, we are actively pursuing pilots with major court systems to deploy StreamSettle as a docket-clearing solution. By identifying settleable cases before they consume judicial resources, we aim to drastically reduce the overwhelming backlogs that paralyze our courts, freeing up judges to focus on complex litigation. Our true mission is to reduce the human toll of the process. By removing adversarial friction from routine claims, we allow injured parties to receive fair compensation months faster. We are live, generating revenue, and executing a density strategy that is proving the model works. We would be honored to showcase this at the ABA TECHSHOW. Company Name Trailmate Elevator Pitch Trailmate is the first client-facing AI agent built for law firms – a digital employee designed to handle client-facing work end to end. Lawyers tell Trailmate what they need done (run intake, collect documents, gather discovery responses, give case updates, etc.), and Trailmate turns that request into action – contacting clients and following up autonomously until the task is complete. Firms supervise progress and results in real time, without chasing clients or adding staff. What makes your company unique or innovative? Trailmate is unique because it is not just a chatbot or workflow tool. It is an outward-facing digital employee that actually engages clients autonomously. Lawyers delegate an objective in plain English, and Trailmate autonomously contacts clients, conducts structured conversations, follows up until tasks are complete, validates the results, and escalates only when human judgment is needed. This “delegate and supervise” model creates a new category in legal tech: AI as a digital employee, not software. What problem does your product solve? Trailmate solves one of the most persistent and costly problems in law firms: client-facing work that requires constant chasing, follow-up, and coordination. Intake, document collection, discovery responses, status updates, and other routine communications are repetitive, often deadline-sensitive, and highly dependent on client responsiveness, yet they consume enormous staff time and routinely stall matters. Who are your competitors? Our closest points of comparison are Case Status and Hona, which are modern client communication and portal tools. However, these products are fundamentally passive: they surface information to clients but still rely on firm staff to drive follow-up, collect documents, and move matters forward. Trailmate operates in a different category. It is not a client portal or messaging layer. It is an outward-facing AI agent that executes client-facing work end to end. There is no direct equivalent to this “delegate and supervise” digital-employee model in the legal market today. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://vimeo.com/1152280813 When was the company founded? 2025-06-12. Where is the company located? Woodland Hills, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to medium size law firms with consumer clients (particularly plaintiff-side firms in areas like employment, personal injury, immigration, family law, and consumer law) What is the price of your product or service? Trailmate is sold as a subscription, priced based on the number of active matters and the volume of client-facing work handled by the AI agent. Contracts range from $1,000 per month to $5,000 per month or more, depending on the firm’s volume. Tell us more about your traction. Trailmate is currently in stealth, with a public launch scheduled for January 13, 2026. To date, we have several law firms actively piloting the platform and additional firms in the pipeline that have expressed strong interest and are queued for onboarding post-launch. We have been running Trailmate in production within my own firm, Frontier Law Center, as a design-partner environment. In that setting alone, Trailmate has already conducted 100+ hours of active client conversations, autonomously collected over 1,100 client documents, and completed more than 350 distinct client-facing tasks on behalf of the firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, Trailmate’s growth plan is centered on category creation, disciplined expansion, and deep integration into how law firms operate. We will begin by converting our current pilots into paying customers immediately following our January 2026 launch, while onboarding additional early adopters through founder-led sales and partnerships with legal-tech platforms. Shortly after launch, we plan to raise a pre-seed round to accelerate product development, integrations, and go-to-market execution. Trailmate has been fully bootstrapped to date, with product-market validation driven by real usage inside my own law firm. As a domain-expert founder and recognized thought leader in legal AI, I am well connected with both forward-thinking law firms and complementary legal-tech vendors. I plan to leverage these relationships, in addition to traditional advertising / marketing efforts. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. I was born in the Philippines and came to the U.S. when I was 3 (half Filipino) and my co-founder is Indian. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Trailmate is committed to building a diverse and inclusive legal tech community by intentionally hiring with diversity in mind as we grow. We believe assembling a team with varied backgrounds and perspectives leads to better products, a broader worldview, and technology that serves a wider range of law firms and clients more effectively. Anything else you’d like us to know? I am a very early design partner with Eve. We were featured as one of the first law firms to coin the term “AI-Native Law Firm” – https://www.legaltech-talk.com/frontier-law-center-taps-eve-to-become-the-first-ai-native-law-firm/ Company Name TwinCounsel, Inc. Elevator Pitch TwinCounsel is an AI delegation platform for solo and small law firms. Our AI teammate lives in the lawyer’s inbox, automatically building case context from emails and attachments. Lawyers delegate tasks like drafting subpoenas or financial disclosures in plain English – just by replying to an email. Every fact is auditable with source citations. We’ve proven 90% time savings, cutting 90-minute tasks to nine minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? We solve the context problem that blocks AI adoption in legal. Most legal AI tools are “bring-your-own-context” – they are blank slates that require manual input before they can help. TwinCounsel is different. We automatically build structured case knowledge from the lawyer’s inbox – extracting parties, timelines, facts, deadlines, and documents without any data entry. This organized case intelligence is what makes trusted AI delegation possible. Three differentiators: (1) Inbox-native – we live where lawyers already work, eliminating adoption friction; (2) Automatic case context – our system understands the matter before the lawyer asks for help; (3) Auditable outputs – every generated fact links back to its source, solving lawyers’ #1 trust barrier. What problem does your product solve? Solo lawyers lose over 60% of their day to administrative chaos. Critical case facts are buried across 50-300 emails per matter – scattered in threads, attachments, and forwarded documents. Before lawyers can do actual legal work, they’re forced to manually hunt, organize, and re-type information. This “context gap” causes missed facts, missed deadlines, malpractice exposure, and the painful reality of working 8 hours but billing for only 3. Existing tools don’t solve this. Practice management software requires manual data entry – it’s the source of administrative work, not the solution. Generic AI tools are “blank slates” that require lawyers to copy-paste sensitive client data and provide context for every task. Neither approach gives AI what it needs to actually help: deep, organized knowledge of the case. Who are your competitors? 1) Incumbent practice management systems: Clio, MyCase (reactive dashboards requiring manual data entry) 2) AI-native point solutions: CoCounsel (Thomson Reuters), Spellbook, Gavel Exec (bring-your-own-context tools with no systemic case knowledge) 3) Generic AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Claude (high-friction copy-paste workflows with confidentiality risks) Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/525e13a6982848539308722214b7031d. When was the company founded? 2025-05-17. Where is the company located? San Jose, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Solo and small law firm attorneys (1-10 attorneys), initially focused on family law, criminal law, and estates/private client practices. What is the price of your product or service? TBD: Subscription fee, tiered by number of matters. Tell us more about your traction Pre-revenue, but we’ve validated the core thesis hands-on. We embedded ourselves for two months inside a San Jose family/criminal law firm, running a “Concierge MVP” where we manually did the work our software will automate. This proved three things: 1) We can build a 360-degree view of a case from email. By assembling context from scattered emails, attachments, and threads, we created the organized case knowledge that makes accurate AI outputs possible. 2) Context + AI done right = highly accurate work. With proper case context, our AI-generated drafts were more accurate than the firm’s paralegal – and verifiable back to source documents. 3) 90% time savings are real and repeatable. Financial disclosures dropped from 90 minutes to 9. Routine court filings from 60 minutes to 6. We’re now expanding our design partner program across practice areas (workflows): our original criminal/family law partner (subpoenas, financial disclosures), personal injury (demand letters), and estates (discovery responses). The workflows differ but the pattern holds – scattered inbox context transformed into accurate, cited drafts. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1: Win the beachhead. Convert design partners to paying customers, ship self-serve onboarding, and integrate with core tools lawyers already use (Clio, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365). Prove that we can turn inbox chaos into organized case intelligence that powers trusted AI delegation. Year 2: Expand across practice areas (family → criminal → estates → immigration → plaintiff PI) and scale to 500+ solo and small-firm users. Deepen integrations so TwinCounsel becomes the connective layer between a firm’s scattered tools—the AI that finally makes their existing software work together. Years 3-5: Become the AI orchestration layer for the small law firm ecosystem. Our structured case knowledge—automatically built from email, documents, and connected systems—becomes the foundation that powers increasingly autonomous workflows. We capture a meaningful share of the $60B legal support market by replacing manual administrative work with intelligent delegation. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our founding team bridges three continents. Josh Dorward (CEO) is a dual U.S.-Taiwan citizen who spent the past year in Taiwan connecting with the local startup ecosystem; we’re building our core engineering team there. Kenji Hashimoto (CTO) holds triple citizenship – Japan, U.K. and U.S. – bringing a global perspective to our technical leadership. Together we combine Silicon Valley startup experience with deep ties to Asian engineering talent and international markets. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As an early-stage company, we’re just beginning to engage with the legal tech community. Our approach to team-building is intentionally global – we’re hiring our founding engineering team in Taiwan rather than defaulting to Silicon Valley, bringing geographic and cultural diversity into legal tech from day one. As we grow, we’re committed to maintaining this global perspective in our hiring and community participation. Anything else you’d like us to know? We’re YC S17 alumni with a prior exit (Indivio acquired by Cloudinary). This is the same proven founding team reuniting with perfect founder-market fit: Josh brings legal domain expertise (licensed CA attorney, JD/MBA) plus AI product leadership (Cloudinary GM); Kenji brings 10+ years of automation/AI systems architecture. We’re not theorizing – we’ve validated workflows inside a real firm and proven 10x efficiency gains. Company Name LMI Network LLC Elevator Pitch In an online world where AI algorithms polarize and divide, ZODR (pronounced Zoe-D-R) promotes conflict resolution using AI to help mediators resolve legal disputes between parties. Since most mediators use Zoom, a tool that is also installed on millions of potential mediation parties’ devices, ZODR, through its Zoom integration, gives mediators 1 hub to manage their mediation cases, and after all parties’ give consent to the AI “listening in,” lets mediators get AI recommendations on how to resolve the dispute. What makes your company unique or innovative? ZODR differs from standard case management software and generic use of Zoom for mediation in three ways: What problem does your product solve? Since the shift to online dispute resolution (ODR) after the pandemic’s “zoom boom,” and the explosion of AI legal tools after the 2022 public launch of ChatGPT, conflict resolution professionals are still figuring out how to administer an online mediation practice that incorporates AI and scale it on the web in an era where physical borders no longer matter. While the digital world moves instantly, mediators and arbitrators still spend manual time incorporating AI, chasing emails, scheduling across time zones, and drafting routine settlement clauses from scratch, all as part of their workflow. This friction delays justice and limits the number of clients a professional can serve. ZODR presents an intuitive platform that incorporates optional AI into the mediation session, and helps the conflict resolution professional manage all their matters in kanban-style birds-eye views. Additionally, ZODR addresses the fragmented workflows of the past where sensitive case data is scattered across Zoom, email, and Word documents, creating security risks and breaking the mediator’s flow. ZODR brings order by helping mediators actively manage the lifecycle of the dispute from intake to signed agreement, all with the help of an AI co-mediator. Who are your competitors? Some competitioners in the ODR space include: ODR.com, ADRNotable, Immediation, Next Level Mediation. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/BALex6b2FTk.

What is the price of your product or service? $29.99 per seat per month after a 14-day free trial, but discounted on an annual basis and for larger organizations. Tell us more about your traction. Since evolving the “Instant Mediators” community into the LMI Professionals (pros.lminetwork.com) list of online mediators, we have a subscriber base that will be the first to experience ZODR alongside others who have signed up for the wait list. More data will be available soon as we make ZODR fully operational to the general public. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. First, we are not starting from zero since ZODR is part of the LMI Network (lminetwork.com); We are looking to convert the existing user base of LMI “Professionals” (pros.lminetwork.com) (formerly InstantMediators.com). Additionally, we are leveraging the “Justice Sites” (justicesites.com) initiative (launching 2026) to bundle high-performance lawyer and mediator websites with a ZODR subscription. This creates a “sticky” ecosystem where a mediator’s marketing (website) and operations (ZODR) are unified so we can sell a complete “virtual practice” to online mediators. Lastly, we own the LMI Network YouTube channel (YouTube.com/@lminetwork) and podcast (lmipodcast.com), which provides an existing outlet for marketing ZODR features and capabilities in video format. The channel lets us host media content, engage with users, and deliver support tips via video on a ZODR videos playlist. By year 2, we plan to then expand from individual practitioners to small firms and court-annexed mediation programs or community mediation offices. We believe there’s a market for larger high-volume mediation organizations who want to develop their online dispute resolution presence and handle disputes at scale across multiple jurisdictions. This would be most advantageous to family and small claims mediation organizations. By year 3, we want to focus on growing internationally across several markets and expand in multiple languages. AI’s ability to translate/interpret conversations in real time lowers the costs once associated with multilingual dispute resolution. Now mediators around the world can use ZODR to mediate with residents who not only reside outside their jurisdictions, but who also speak a different language. ODR is a worldwide phenomenon because all societies have conflicts and most adults globally now have a full mediation office in their pockets called Zoom. ZODR leverages these 2 facts in order to promote access to justice. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. ZODR is a minority-owned business, founded by a first-generation immigrant lawyer and mediator who believes in the American Dream. Mac Pierre-Louis’ cross-border perspective ensures the platform is designed for global jurisdictional compatibility and will drive the mission of democratizing access to justice by making dispute resolution accessible to anyone who can use Zoom for mediation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? In addition to the above where ZODR is a minority-founded company led by a Black male attorney-mediator and first-generation American residing in Texas, ZODR has hired a Bangladesh-origin development firm, headquartered in Wyoming. This cross-border and diverse leadership ensures our product design avoids the “US-centric/English-only” bias often found in many legal tech. Additionally, we promote access to justice. ZODR is about lowering the cost of dispute resolution by helping mediators run and manage their practices online with the assistance of AI. Traditional litigation is expensive and intimidating; ZODR’s efficiency tools allow mediators to handle lower-value cases profitably. This indirectly empowers underserved communities—who can be encouraged to use Zoom for mediation since they often cannot afford to take time off work to travel to a physical courthouse. ZODR gives the mediator a platform to run and manage their Zoom mediation so that disputing parties can access justice from their mobile devices. Anything else you’d like us to know? While it’s great to disrupt industries and change paradigms to make products better and increase value, we are mindful that in the legal field, innovation will also be measured by how much chaos or stability the innovation brings. Therefore, ZODR is not trying to replace mediators or just outsource legal disputes to AI. ZODR brings the focus back to the human neutral in the middle by augmenting their skills so they can help other people. Human-based conflict resolution will remain the focus of our work.

Infosys Ltd risks losing over a third of its $400 million annual revenue from Daimler, one of its three largest clients, as the German auto giant seeks a new vendor for software and equipment following execution delays, according to two people familiar with the details. India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services provider stands to lose the largest part of the contract under which it procured and provided iPhone cases, laptops, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and fingerprint readers for the automakers’ back-end information technology (IT) operations, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. Bengaluru-based Infosys, which ended the previous fiscal ended March 2025 (FY25) with $19.28 billion in revenue, would now need to backfill $150 million, or 0.7% of its business, before eyeing incremental growth when macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff wars, and the rise of automation tools have squeezed client spending. “It is unlikely that Infosys will see meaningful incremental revenue from Daimler in the near term,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based IT research and consulting firm. “Even where renewals occur, pricing pressure and scope rationalization typically offset any expansion. The focus is more on retaining relevance in strategic digital, engineering, and core platform areas rather than growing total contract value.” In December 2020, Infosys signed a $3.2 billion, eight-year IT transformation deal with Daimler. Under the terms, Infosys would provide services across six business divisions, including network services, cybersecurity, SAP software, data centres, after-sales call services, and workplace solutions or the IT procurement business–the biggest of the six arms. Daimler had split into Mercedes-Benz Group and Daimler Trucks in December 2021, but both units retained Infosys for IT services work. “Workplace solutions was supposed to be renewed last year but we are now waiting for June to get a clearer picture. We had floated an RFP (request for proposal) but that was not agreed upon by the client,” said the first of the two people quoted earlier. According to the second person, the partial renewal of the deal comes amid differences between the two companies over execution and billing delays. As of 12 January, Daimler, including Mercedes and Daimler Trucks, owes almost $47 million in dues to Infosys since 2021. Mint could not independently ascertain whether large deals have a provision to extend individual segments. However, the cybersecurity and data centre services have been renewed until 2029 under the Infosys-Daimler deal, while SAP, call functionality, and network segments have not been fully renewed yet, said the second person. Queries emailed to Infosys on Friday went unanswered, while Daimler and Mercedes-Benz declined to comment on “supplier relationships” and “internal processes”. One of India’s top IT services providers is eyeing a portion of Infosys’ contract with Daimler and has “already made a bid”, said the second person. Mint could not ascertain the name of the company. The Daimler contract was one of the dozen mega deals worth over $1 billion that the company has won since Salil Parekh took over as chief executive officer in January 2018, steering the company to outperform its peers in the number of mega deals secured. According to an executive, Daimler is one of Infosys’s three largest clients, after Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other large contracts Infosys won include the July 2020 10-year deal worth $1.89 billion with Vanguard and a $1.6-billion contract with the UK’s public health provider, the National Health Service, signed in October last year. The Daimler project is dubbed the ‘twice as fast program’ for Infosys. It helped double Infosys’s revenue from manufacturers to $3 billion last fiscal from $1.3 billion in FY20. During this five-year period, Infosys’s overall revenue grew 42% to $19.28 billion in FY25. The company, which announces its third-quarter results on 14 January, expects to end FY26 with revenue growth of 2-3% in constant-currency terms, a measure that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Revenue from Infosys Automotive and Mobility GmbH, a subsidiary that the IT giant created for the Daimler project, declined for the first time in FY25. It fell 8.5% over the previous fiscal to $418 million, after growing more than 40% for two straight years, according to JM Financial analysts. The unit has also been unprofitable for four straight years. “If there is a revenue decline in the subsidiary, it clearly means that revenue from the Daimler account has reached its peak and matured,” wrote JM Financial’s Abhishek Kumar and Nandan Arekal in a note dated 16 June 2025. Mint had reported on 24 February last year that Infosys was eyeing an early renewal with Daimler with a new AI arm. It now risks losing incremental business if the workplace arm of the deal is not renewed. Still, ending part of previously signed contracts with IT services providers is not new. Several companies have opened their own back-end tech centres, terminating contracts with existing IT vendors mid-way through the deal. Transamerica nixed a 10-year IT outsourcing deal worth $2 billion with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in June 2023, five years after signing the contract. Similarly, later that year, third-largest HCL Technologies and State Street called off their decade-long partnership after the client in-sourcing its tech needs.
