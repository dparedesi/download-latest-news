Activist Robby Starbuck posts brutal takedown of Cracker Barrel https://www.foxnews.com/video/6377293683112 Most important—from all the comments—is that diners apparently felt comforted and reassured they were dining in the right place by the guy in a rocking chair. More proof that their customer base is aging out. Apparently that message is "My thirteen-year-old daughter designed this logo." More proof that their customer base is aging out......diners apparently felt comforted and reassured they were dining in the right place by the guy in a rocking chair Lotsa restaurants cater to the retired crowd-—they have the time and money to eat out. Exactly. Those three evils. Bust the Trust. Why does that bother you so much?, at all? All the better for mom and pop breakfast places. No chains and the money stays in the community instead of lining the pockets of Blackrock types. That doesn’t bother me. At all. I was just offering my educated opinion. >>>All the better for mom and pop breakfast places<<< My FIL’s favorite: https://www.cafechandler.com/ My favorite: https://hangarcafeaz.net/ All the better for mom and pop breakfast places.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 4:20:09 PM PDT by CFW Wyoming and 10 other states’ claims that giant investment companies conspired to drive coal production down and drive prices up — increasing people’s energy costs — are at least plausible enough to keep a lawsuit alive, a judge has ruled. Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led the litigation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the complaint. The states allege the three massive investment companies acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the U.S., then agreed to use their holdings to influence those companies and artificially depress the output of coal. “Defendants allegedly did so in the name of ‘environmental stewardship’ and ‘concern for the climate,’” recounted U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle in an Aug. 1 order. “The result, Plaintiffs assert, is that ‘Defendants have reaped the rewards of higher returns, higher fees, and higher profits, while American consumers have paid the price in higher utility bills and higher costs.’” (Excerpt) Read more at cowboystatedaily.com ...

August 22, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. New York, NY, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our company,” or “MFH”) (Nasdaq: MFH), a blockchain-powered fintech group, today announced that a broad range of institutional investors reported holdings in MFH in their latest regulatory filings. Recent 13F and related regulatory disclosures report institutional positions in MFH by major index and asset managers, global banks, and ETF sponsors, reflecting a larger and more diverse institutional holder base for MFH compared to prior periods. Reported filers include BlackRock, Geode Capital Management, State Street, Vanguard, Northern Trust, and others. The Company has also observed that several notable pension funds — including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund — have also slightly increased their holdings of the Company’s stock. Both new filers and additional positions from existing institutions contributed to the increase in institutional exposure, and largely follow the Company's inclusion in the Russell 2000 index. Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers for index funds and are commonly employed as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Though these index-driven acquisitions are primarily mechanical, reflecting index-related or passive investment activity, and should not be viewed as a strategic endorsement of the Company, MFH views the expanding institutional presence as a meaningful acknowledgement of its fintech and digital asset platform development. "Having more institutional investors on board is exciting for us," said Shi Qiu, CEO of MFH. "It not only brings more liquidity to our stock but also puts us in front of a wider investment community. While we understand much of this activity is potentially index-related, we're confident that as we continue building out our fintech capabilities and delivering results, these relationships will deepen." About the filingsThe summary above draws on Form 13F and related regulatory filings reported in early to mid-August 2025. Institutional holdings can change at any time, may be reported through multiple affiliated entities, and many positions are passive. References to institutional names are based solely on publicly available filings and are provided for informational purposes only.The inclusion of MFH in institutional portfolios does not necessarily represent an investment recommendation or active investment decision. MFH does not disclose or comment on the specific size of any investor’s holdings. About Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc.Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. (Nasdaq: MFH) is a fintech group powered by blockchain infrastructure, offering technology and financial services. Through its subsidiaries including Chaince Securities, LLC, MFH aims to bridge traditional finance and digital innovation, offering services spanning digital assets, financial advisory, and capital markets solutions.
