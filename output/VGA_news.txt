During this weekend's LL Cool J-hosted 2025 MTV VMAs (Sunday, Sept. 7th, on CBS, MTV, and Paramount+), Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, YUNGBLUD, and Nuno Bettencourt will unite for a once-in-a-lifetime performance honoring the legendary "Prince of Darkness" and metal luminary Ozzy Osbourne with a medley of his greatest hits. Throughout his career, Osbourne has had a lasting impact on not just music but on the pop culture landscape. With more than 120 million albums sold worldwide, the global rock icon, multiplatinum singer-songwriter, and pop culture phenom was a five-time Grammy winner and two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee (with Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024), along with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a number of other top honors. It goes without saying that Osbourne and MTV have had a close relationship over the years, including Headbanger's Ball, specials & spotlights built around "OzzFest," and Osbourne's successful reality-show run that kicked off with The Osbournes.

September 05, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, confirms that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, officially broke ground on its $300 million Sunset Amphitheater on June 13, 2025, in McKinney, Texas. According to Founder, Chairman, and CEO J.W. Roth, the Sunset VENU will be “the most luxurious fully seated, multi-configuration, all-season venue in history.” The amphitheater will feature a canopied roof, wind walls, LuxeFire Suites, and a members-only Aikman Club, in collaboration with NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, Founder of EIGHT Elite Light Beer. Nestled at the center of the amphitheater, the Aikman Club offers one-of-a-kind views, premium seating, and high-end amenities. With a capacity of up to 20,000 guests, more than double the 8,000-seat Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, the Sunset Amphitheater is positioned as a premier destination for live entertainment. Institutional VIP Momentum Institutional investors have been quick to recognize VENU’s value creation. Over the last month: Analyst Support Strengthens the Story Wall Street coverage is building alongside institutional ownership. Cenorium Capital recently reiterated its Strong Buy rating with a $22 price target, while Northland Securities raised its target from $15 to $17, maintaining its Buy rating. Analysts point to VENU’s amphitheater model, accelerating municipal pipeline, and diversified funding approach as key drivers of long-term value. National Recognition & Strategic Partnerships VENU has been recognized nationally by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Denver Post, Billboard, VenuesNow, and Variety for its innovative and disruptive approach to live entertainment. Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders, such as AEG Presents, VENU continues to shape the future of the entertainment landscape. Municipalities are also lining up. Economic impact studies from the McKinney Sunset Amphitheater project, which is expected to generate over $3 billion in impact within the first decade, have catalyzed community interest nationwide. “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area,” said Roth. “To accelerate these agreements, we’ve partnered with industry leader Ryan, who is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter. On average, each delivered development agreement can add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet.” Growth Pipeline & Financial Catalysts “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund expansion—through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks of underlying land,” added Roth. “The future we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months.” Long-Term Vision By 2030, VENU plans to operate 25 amphitheaters and 15 indoor entertainment complexes, totaling 350,000+ seats. That scale translates to over 20 million annual tickets sold and more than $2 billion in gross ticket sales volume, cementing VENU as a leader in next-generation live entertainment.
