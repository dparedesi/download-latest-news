December 16, 2025 10:35 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global semi-trailer dealership market was valued at US$ 10.6 billion in 2025 and is projected to surpass US$ 17.7 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period 2026–2035. The semi-trailer dealership market is currently defined by a remarkable upswing in new equipment acquisitions. Fleets are clearly investing with confidence. In June 2025, net orders for new trailers in the U.S. climbed to nearly 15,400 units. Such strong monthly performance contributed to a year-to-date total of 92,000 units by the end of that month. Consequently, the momentum continued, pushing the cumulative order count to an impressive 109,800 units by August 2025, signaling a period of aggressive fleet expansion and renewal. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/semi-trailer-dealership-market This wave of orders creates a ripple effect, translating directly into healthy backlogs and financial stability for manufacturers. For example, Wabash National reported an order backlog valued at approximately USD 1.2 billion at the end of 2024. Of that substantial figure, USD 813 million was for trailers scheduled for shipment within the next year. The second quarter of 2024 saw a robust 30,900 units ordered in the U.S. market alone. Moreover, this is a global trend, as seen in Spain, where 15,009 new semi-trailers were registered in 2024. Key Findings in Semi-Trailer Dealership Market Strategic Dealer Expansions Reshape Regional Access and Service Delivery To meet this rising demand, key players in the semi-trailer dealership market are strategically expanding their physical footprints. Great Dane recently launched a modern sales and service facility in Sutton, Massachusetts, in mid-2025. Following a similar path, Double A Utility Trailer Sales celebrated the grand opening of its second Ohio location in June 2024. Beyond new builds, consolidation is creating more powerful regional networks. A merger of two major Texas dealers in October 2025 created Utility Trailer of Texas, which already has plans for new stores in Fort Worth and Austin. These strategic moves are designed to enhance service coverage and market penetration. A major consolidation in January 2025 united Utility Trailer dealer groups across Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington, creating a powerhouse in the Mountain West. This expansion is backed by increased manufacturing might. Great Dane is constructing a massive 450,000-square-foot refrigerated trailer plant in Georgia. The new facility will create over 400 jobs, ensuring a steady flow of new inventory into the semi-trailer dealership market. Service and Parts Operations Emerge as Critical Dealership Growth Centers Today’s dealerships are becoming much more than sales lots; they are sophisticated service and parts hubs. The recent merger of Utility Trailer dealers in Texas, for instance, created a network with a combined total of over 140 service bays. Likewise, Northeast Great Dane’s new Massachusetts facility features impressive 180-foot-long drive-through service bays. Double A Utility Trailer Sales' new Ohio location includes a modern shop with eight service bays. These investments underscore the growing importance of maintenance and repair revenue. A thriving parts business is essential to support these advanced service operations in the semi-trailer dealership market. Wabash National’s Parts & Services division reported net sales of USD 48.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, highlighting the segment's financial power. New facilities, like those from Great Dane and Double A Utility, now feature dedicated parts warehouses and showrooms. Furthermore, dealers are adapting to new product lines, with the Valley Equipment group stocking parts and providing service for Cargobull’s refrigeration units, demonstrating a commitment to full-service support. A Dynamic Used Trailer Market Creates Vital Opportunities for Buyers The secondary market provides a crucial and energetic channel within the broader semi-trailer dealership market. Online auctions feature a wide variety of equipment, offering an accessible entry point for smaller fleets and independent operators. Recent auction listings included everything from a 2005 Trailmobile 48-foot dry van to a specialized 2023 Custom Trailer Specialists 45-foot end dump trailer. Even unique assets, like a 1981 Dairy Equipment Co. 7,500-gallon water tank trailer, find new owners through these platforms. The market for late-model used equipment is also remarkably strong, reflecting high residual values. For instance, a 2022 De Lucio USA 53-foot dry van with an 80,000-pound gross vehicle weight rating was sold at auction in May 2024. Power units are also in high demand, with a 2015 Kenworth T800 listed with a starting bid of USD 9,000 and a 2022 Kenworth T370 priced at USD 140,000. The availability of an unused 2024 Peterbilt 389X heavy haul truck further illustrates the depth and liquidity of the used market. Major Fleet Management Cycles Directly Influence Dealership Market Trends The operational cycles of large fleet management companies have a direct and significant impact on the semi-trailer dealership market. Industry giants like Penske, U-Haul, and Walmart are major sellers at auctions, consistently turning over their fleets. Their refreshment cycles provide a steady supply of well-maintained, late-model used trucks and trailers. This inventory is a vital resource for dealerships, allowing them to serve customers who prefer or require pre-owned equipment. These large operators also serve as bellwethers for the industry. Ryder’s 2025 forecast, for example, points to a convergence of spot and contract rates, a trend that will require all fleets to sharpen their pricing strategies. Ryder is also focused on adapting to new customer expectations and evolving regulations. Their strategic decisions and equipment choices often set the standard, influencing demand patterns and technology adoption across the entire semi-trailer dealership market. Specialized Vocational Trailer Segments Drive Niche Market Growth and Diversification Beyond the high-volume dry van and reefer segments, specialized vocational trailers are carving out significant growth areas. The global flatbed trailer market, for example, was projected to reach a size of USD 7.94 billion in 2024, driven by strong activity in manufacturing, energy, and construction. Demand is further supported by government-funded infrastructure projects, creating reliable, long-term opportunities for the semi-trailer dealership market. This trend is global. A 2024 market analysis from Spain showed that specialized vehicles like dump trucks and tankers were leading growth. The refrigerated trailer market has also rebounded strongly. In response, Great Dane's new Georgia plant will have the capacity to produce over 5,000 refrigerated trailers annually. While dry and reefer vans have accounted for more than 75% of U.S. trailer sales in recent years, these specialized segments provide crucial diversification and profitability for dealers. Advanced Technology Integration Is Now a Core Mandate for Modern Dealerships The role of the dealership is transforming into that of a technology solutions provider. Fleets are increasingly adopting AI and data analytics for predictive maintenance and operational efficiency, and they rely on dealers for the installation and servicing of these systems. Enhanced safety sensors for features like lane departure warnings and automatic braking are becoming standard. Investments in sophisticated telematics are also on the rise, helping fleets meet both performance and environmental goals. Regulatory shifts are a major catalyst for this technological evolution. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is rolling out a new registration system through 2025. At the same time, Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) are evolving to track detailed driving behavior metrics. Emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies will soon allow trucks to share real-time hazard alerts. The modern semi-trailer dealership market is at the center of deploying and maintaining these complex, interconnected systems. Sophisticated Financial Strategies are Underpinning Semi-Trailer Dealership Market Stability and Growth Financial services are a critical, value-added component of the modern dealership. Financing options are widely promoted for new and used equipment sales, and an improvement in interest rates is expected to fuel even greater demand for equipment loans and leases. Dealerships with strong in-house or partner financing programs have a distinct competitive advantage. The financial health of manufacturers is equally important, providing a stable foundation for the entire market. Wabash National offers a strong example of prudent financial management. In 2024, the company repurchased USD 64.4 million of its common stock while also paying out USD 14.8 million in dividends. It maintained a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 2.1:1.0 at the end of the year. For 2025, Wabash plans to fund its capital expenditures and working capital from operating cash flows, ensuring a steady production pipeline to support its dealer network. Need a Customized Version? Request It Now: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/semi-trailer-dealership-market Overcoming the Skilled Technician Shortage Is the Market's Pressing Challenge The growth trajectory of the entire semi-trailer dealership market faces a significant obstacle: a critical shortage of skilled service technicians. A 2025 survey confirmed that a large number of diesel shops are understaffed. The problem is worsened by an estimated annual churn rate of 120,000 technicians across the industry. Projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that demand for qualified technicians will continue to grow, making the competition for talent even more intense. In response, forward-thinking industry leaders are investing heavily in workforce development. Southland Transportation Group, for instance, launched a youth diesel technician apprenticeship program in August 2024, which accepts participants as young as 16 for paid, on-the-job training. The need is urgent. An untrained new hire requires an average of 357 training hours, costing an estimated USD 8,211 in wages alone. Proactive training and recruitment programs are no longer just a good idea; they are essential for future success.

Sternal surgical site infections after cardiac surgery can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The effects of negative pressure wound management and adding vancomycin as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis are unknown. The PICS-PREVENA pilot/vanguard trial, a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial with 4 periods, was conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Sites were randomized to one of eight sequences of the four study arms (Cefazolin or Cefazolin + Vancomycin (not analyzed) and standard wound dressing or a negative pressure 3M Prevena incision management system (Prevena). Only diabetic or obese patients were eligible for the latter comparison. This trial investigated feasability including adherence to protocol of each intervention (goal: > 90% each) and loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%). Among the 4107 included patients, 2230 were obese/diabetic (1208 standard wound dressing period, 1022 during Prevena period). Compliance to wound management and antimicrobial prophylaxis was 68.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Loss to follow-up was 3.6%. Deep/organ-space sternal surgical site infections occurred in 16 (1.6%) patients in the Prevena allocated periods and in 17 (1.4%) patients in the standard wound dressing allocated periods (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.56–2.20). Other clinical outcomes did not suggest a difference and a post-hoc as-treated analysis showed similar results. This study showed challenges with introducing a novel technology as standard of care, with non-compliance mostly driven by one of the sites. No firm conclusions should be drawn regarding the effectiveness of Prevena, as this vanguard trial was not powered for clinical outcomes.

USA (Grant/Research Support) This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The prevalence of surgical site infections (SSI), one of the most common infections, varies between 0.6–9.5%, depending on the surgical procedure [1]. The occurrence of SSIs is associated with long-term harm, increased mortality, and cost [2–4]. In cardiac surgery, SSIs include local infections at the thoracic and sternal wounds (s-SSI) and infections at vein harvesting sites, which both are reported in about 2% of patients [5,6]. Obese patients or patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for s-SSI after cardiac surgery [6–8]. The multiple interventions, which are recommended to prevent SSIs, can be divided into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions [9]. The use of incisional negative pressure wound dressing therapy, a postoperative measure, was found to be associated with a probable decrease in SSI compared to standard dressing in a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials [10]. However, data regarding cardiac surgery, either for the sternal or vein harvest surgical site, is limited and the low quality of existing studies highlights the need for large, randomised trials [10,11]. The combination of cluster randomization, factorial- and crossover-designs can make large trials more feasible and efficient, provide data in real-world settings, investigate multiple interventions, and control cluster level confounding variables by having each cluster act as its own control [12–14]. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery (PICS)-PREVENA Pilot/Vanguard study is a multicenter cluster-randomized 2x2 factorial crossover trial investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis (cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis vs cefazolin prophylaxis) and the impact of the negative pressure wound treatment (negative pressure Prevena dressing vs standard wound dressing) on the occurrence of SSIs in patients having cardiac surgery. Here we report the feasibility outcomes of adherence to protocol and loss to follow-up as well as the clinical endpoints comparing Prevena to standard wound dressing (S1 Appendix). Reporting of this trial followed the CONSORT checklist – extension for pilot and feasibility trials [15]. (S2 Appendix). PICS-Prevena is a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03402945) conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Hospitals performing more than 300 cardiac surgeries a year were eligible. Clinical Trial Ontario (CTO) approved the study and waived the need for individual patient consent. The study design was adapted from the Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery study, which is still underway [13] (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02285140). The trial was funded by KCI Inc. USA. The industry sponsor had no role in conducting the trial other than supporting education on their product at the study site. The industry sponsor did provide input on the study design, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The industry sponsor had no role in data collection, analysis and had no access to the raw data. The industry sponsor had the right to review and provide feedback on the manuscript before submission, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The target sample size for the pilot/vanguard phase was 4,000 patients, with roughly 500 patients per each of the four treatment allocations within a 2x2 factorial design at each of the two participating sites resulting in 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the feasibility outcomes within a small margin of less than ± 1%. Such narrow confidence intervals for feasibility outcomes would not necessarily be needed. However, given that randomization was conducted at the cluster level, we needed to enroll at least two sites to gain the necessary insight into potential challenges with the feasibility of the study design for a potential full trial. All patients ≥18 years undergoing open-heart surgery with sternotomy, including minimally invasive sternotomies, during the study period were included. Patients were excluded if they were on systemic antibiotics or if they had an active bacterial infection at the time of surgery, were previously enrolled in this trial, were known to be colonized with MRSA, had a beta-lactam or vancomycin allergy precluding the use of cefazolin or vancomycin, or were participating in other studies that may interfere with this trial. Furthermore, patients with sensitivity to silver received a standard wound dressing in all study arms as Prevena is contraindicated in these patients. The hospitals were randomly assigned using computer-based randomization to one of eight potential sequences of the four treatment allocations. These four were: i) cefazolin prophylaxis plus Prevena, ii) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus Prevena, iii) cefazolin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing, and iv) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing (S1 Fig). The wound management and antibiotic prophylaxis strategy became standard of care for patients undergoing cardiac surgery during a respective study period. Based on the increased risk for s-SSI, the subgroup of patients who were obese (BMI>=30 kg/m2) or diabetic were eligible for Prevena, and as such the comparison of the wound dressing strategy is limited to this population. The hospital was informed about the next treatment allocation four weeks before the implementation. Before a new study arm was introduced, there was a wash-in phase of four weeks for the new antibiotic prophylaxis. For treatment allocations where Prevena was required, the use of Prevena was introduced in the last week of the wash-in period. The wash-in periods should allow for full-implementation of the interventions as new standard of care and participants undergoing surgery during this time will not be included. To guarantee patient safety, surgeons were allowed to deviate from the standard of care as determined by the treatment allocation whenever deemed necessary. Cefazolin was administered at a dose of 2g (3g if body weight >120 kg) within an hour of the surgery, four hours later or at wound closure (whatever came first), followed by two post-operative dose every 8 hours. Vancomycin was given at a dose of roughly 15 mg/kg and repeated once at 12 hours after the first dose. Prevena was applied to sternal sites and, in case of open saphenous vein harvest, the harvest sites of eligible patients at the end of the procedure. The device was used, as recommended by the manufacturer, for 7 days with a continuous negative pressure at −125 mmHg. User manuals were provided to the participants. Standard wound dressing referred to non-negative pressure wound dressing per standard of care at the hospital. Data was collected from health records and captured in an online research platform. To complete the 90-day follow-up after surgery, data was obtained through a phone call if no follow-up visit was scheduled. Surgical site infections were defined according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Healthcare Safety Network definitions [16]. The outcomes to assess feasibility of this trial design were loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%), adherence to the wound management system (goal: > 90%), and antibiotic regimen as per protocol (goal: > 90%). The primary clinical outcome of the Prevena vs. standard wound dressing arm was a composite of deep incisional or organ/space s-SSI within 90-days. Key secondary clinical effectiveness outcomes were all s-SSI, SSI at the leg site (if open venous saphenous harvest), wound dehiscence, pain intensity at day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality and mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days. In addition, serious adverse device effects (SADEs) were collected during Prevena periods. Detailed information is provided in the statistical analysis plan (S3 Appendix). A blinded outcome adjudication committee reviewed all cases with potential signs or symptoms of an infection that could not be clearly attributed to an infectious focus other than the surgical site(s), and all patients with (suspected) s-SSI. We remain blinded to the results of the two antibiotic strategies as another study assessing the antibiotic strategies using a similar study design is underway [13]. The feasibility outcomes of the vanguard study were summarized by treatment groups as proportions. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the time of randomization to one of the study arms were included (intention-to-treat, ITT). The adherence to the antibiotic regimen was assessed by reviewing health records in a minimum of randomly selected 5% of eligible patients. Baseline data are reported by treatment group using count and percentage for categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. Hierarchical modelling (generalized logistic mixed model) was used for the clinical outcomes in the intention-to-treat high-risk patient population with diabetes mellitus or obesity BMI > 30 kg/m2. Comparisons between the groups were reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Due to only two included sites in the vanguard study, the models included centers as random effects to account for the correlation within a center (ICC) and adjusted for the factorial allocation as a fixed effect. As a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the two centers by examining the interaction between treatment and centers. In addition, given the lower-than-expected adherence to Prevena, we conducted a post-hoc as-treated analysis for the primary clinical outcome. The agreement between the outcome adjudication committee and the site diagnosis for deep/organ s-SSI or all s-SSI, respectively, was calculated using Cohens kappa (κ). The agreement within the 3-member adjudication committee was calculated as the proportion of infections with unanimous agreement among adjudicators out of all deep/organ or superficial s-SSI infections, respectively. During the study period from April 3, 2018, to December 13, 2022 (04/2018-10/2020 at site 1, and 04/2018-12/2022 at site 2), 4621 patients underwent surgery at the two study centers. A total of 4107/4621 (88.9%) were eligible (Fig 1). Of these, 2230/4107 (54%) were either obese or had diabetes and were eligible for the comparison of the two wound management strategies. A total of 1022/2230 (46%) underwent their cardiac surgery while Prevena was standard of care, and 1208/2230 (54.2%) during a standard wound dressing period (Fig 1). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.g001 Of those eligible patients, the overall mean ±standard deviation (SD) age was 67.0 ± 10.7 years and 1025/4107 (25%) were female. Mean ±SD BMI was 29.6 ± 6.1 kg/m2. The most common type of surgery was coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 2451/4107, 60%) and surgical valve intervention (n = 645/4107, 16%) followed by combined CABG and valve intervention (n = 466/4107, 11%) and other, non-specified interventions (n = 545/4107, 13%). Open vein harvesting on the leg was performed in 1295/4107 (31%) patients. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t001 The overall loss to follow-up rate at 90 days was 3.7% (153/4107; 95%CI 3.2–4.3%) and 3.6% (81/2230; 95%CI 2.9–4.4%) for the diabetic or obese population. The adherence to the use of Prevena in eligible patients during study periods when Prevena was considered standard of care was 68.1% (696/1022; 95%CI: 65.2–71.0%) overall, 42.8% (217/507; 95%CI: 38.5–47.1%) for Site A, and 93.0% (479/515; 95%CI: 90.8–95.2%) for site B. Baseline characteristics of non-adherent patients are shown in S1 Table. For compliance with the antibiotic regimen, 245 records of all 4107 (6.0%) randomized patients were evaluated. Documented non-adherence to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was rare with 1.2% (95%CI 0.00–2.6%), 0.4% (95%CI 0.00–1.2%), and 0%, respectively. The primary clinical outcome, the composite of deep or organ-space s-SSI, occurred in 33/2107 (1.5%) diabetic or obese patients, whereby 16/1022 infections (1.6%) were recorded in the Prevena and 17/1208 (1.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.56–2.20) (Table 2). When including superficial infections, a total of 80/2107 (3.6%) s-SSIs were documented, 39/1022 (3.8%) in the Prevena and 41/1208 (3.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR:1.12; 95% CI: 0.71–1.75). Among patients who underwent an open venous saphenous harvest during their cardiac surgery, 5/1022 (1.5%) in the Prevena group and 4/1208 (1.1%) in the standard wound dressing period developed an SSI in their leg. The incidence of sternal wound dehiscence was 22/1022 (2.2%) in the Prevena group and 24/1208 (2.0%) in the standard dressing group (OR:1.09; 95% CI: 0.60–1.95). Pain on day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days were also similar in both groups. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t002 There was no evidence of interaction between treatment effect and centers (p = 0.905) in the sensitivity analysis. Similar odds ratios for the primary clinical outcome were obtained when excluding patients who did not receive Prevena due to protocol deviations (i.e., post-hoc per-protocol analysis) (deep/organ-space SSI: Prevena n = 11 (1.6%) vs standard dressing n = 17 (1.4%); OR: 1.17; 95% CI 0.54–2.53). A total of ten serious adverse device effects were reported, none of which was classified as device related (S2 Table). The agreement between the blinded outcome adjudication committee and the site was substantial for deep/organ s-SSI (κ: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56–0.83) and all s-SSI (κ: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55–0.71). Agreement for deep/organ s-SSI within the adjudication committee was 100% (33/33) and 47% (22/47) for superficial infections, whereby in 88% (22/25) of the disagreements one reviewer voted for no infection and in the remaining three cases more information was requested. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery -PREVENA Vanguard study demonstrates the challenges of a 2x2 factorial crossover design investigating the implementation of new infection prevention interventions as standard of care for s-SSI prevention. Despite meeting the targeted feasibility thresholds for loss to follow up (<10%) and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis as per protocol (>90%), the compliance to use the negative pressure wound therapy system Prevena was 68.1%, only, and failed to reach our 90% target. We observed two contrasting patterns in adherence to the two interventions. Documented non-adherence to antibiotic intervention within the trial was low for each of the time periods and at both study sites. However, the adherence to initiate Prevena in 68.1% did not achieve our predefined target of 90%, highlighting the difficulty in introducing a novel intervention to existing, highly regimented workflows, as present in cardiac surgery. Non-adherence to Prevena was mainly driven by missing application of the wound dressing and not early discontinuation. The fact that one of the two sites showed a much better adherence (93.0% vs 42.8%), may be explained by the fact that this site had experience with using negative pressure wound dressing systems before the launch of the trial, whereas this was a new intervention at the other site. Another major complicating factor was that in contrast to the antibiotic regimen, only the subgroup of patients who were diabetic or obese qualified for the application of Prevena during the respective study period, which required a reliable process to identify those who qualify for Prevena pre-operatively. Again, one site was more successful in implementing this pre-identification process than the other site. Including a longer run-in period to expose sites prior to the change of study arm, might have led to increased adherence. Available comparisons of our adherence rates to similar trials in the literature are limited to gain further insights and adopt possible solutions. Recently published reviews that investigated negative pressure wound therapy did not report utilization of cluster RCTs [11,17,18]. Only one of the included individual-level RCTs – a pilot trial – provided adherence data, showing that 2/35 patients allocated to negative pressure wound dressing were switched to control due to the size of the incision [19]. The learning from the experience with this cluster cross-over pilot/vanguard was that subgrouping a population as part of the study design cannot be reliability implemented, that the protocol must be simple with the same intervention being applied to all patients undergoing the procedure during a given study period, and that for a complex intervention such as the use of a novel wound dressing technology longer phase-in periods may be required. Regardless of whether data collection dovetailed on the existing routine surveillance conducted by infection prevention and control professionals at one site or a research team at the other site, the trial demonstrated high follow up rates of >95% at the three-month mark. We used this study design to maximise generalizability in an area of clinical equipoise, to maintain feasibility despite assessing two interventions at the same time, and to reduce the costs of running a large trial with a small event rate. While following the standard of a cluster randomized trial [20], the research questions and study design meet all conditions proposed by the Council of Medical Sciences to obtain a waiver of informed consent [21], and therefore, the study was approved by the Provincial Ethics Board without the requirement for individual patient consent (Clinical Trials Ontario). This vanguard study was not powered to draw conclusions on clinical outcomes, and therefore, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two wound dressing strategies were expected. Sensitivity analysess investigating heterogeneity of the treatment effect by site or only including on-treatment patients to account for the low rate of adherence to Prevena, did not show a statistically significant difference either. Generally, the assessment of SSI can be challenging, and correct interpretation of case vignettes varies [22,23]. Agreement among blinded adjudicators for deep and organ-space s-SSIs was previously shown to be high [24], and was successfully demonstrated in our vanguard study. Blinded adjudication may be important to overcome the risk of bias from subjective outcomes in unblinded trials [25]. In this pilot/vanguard, there was unanimous agreement on the primary outcome among the outcome adjudication committee members, and the agreement between sites and the adjudication committee was substantial and similar to previous reports for deep infection [24]. Disagreement within the adjudication committee was noticed for superficial infections, which supports the choice of deep/organ-space infections as a primary outcome given the higher level of subjectivity for superficial incisional infections. This vanguard trial has several limitations. First, the trial was stopped after the vanguard phase due to lack of additional funding, hence, it was not powered to draw conclusions on treatment effects. Second, even if most probable of negligible relevance, the trial was repeatedly paused during the COVID-19 pandemic at one site, prolonging the recruitment phase. Reasons for the interruption were lack of study staff or outstanding Prevena resupply during the pandemic and awaiting a protocol amendment to increase recruitment number at the site. In conclusion, conducting the study as planned with a 2x2 factorial cross-over design was feasible. However, adherence to one of the interventions, the Prevena negative wound management system, was lower than expected and suggested that an eventual full trial needs to be simplified with all patients regardless of their individual risk factors to be managed the same way in a given study period. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s002 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s003 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s004 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s005 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s006 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s007 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s008 (CSV) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s009 (TXT) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s010 (PDF)

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Lyme disease (LD) remains the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere, with over 100,000 cases reported annually in Europe, and ~476,000 in the United States [1,2]. Although LD can be treated with antibiotics, if detected early, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for humans to prevent infection. One of the key challenges in developing an effective vaccine against LD stems from the complex biology of Borrelia outer surface proteins (Osps), whose expression is dynamically regulated in response to distinct environmental cues, in both the arthropod vector and vertebrate host (Fig 1). Among the predominant outer surface proteins, OspC expression is induced in ticks during Borrelia transmission, and is sustained during early mammalian host infection, while the expression of OspA is restricted only to the tick phase [3] and is no longer expressed in Borrelia once the infection is established in the mammalian host [4]. As a result, infected humans only rarely develop anti-OspA antibodies [5]. Yet, OspA has proven to be a highly effective vaccine antigen, as it induces antibodies that bind to Borrelia within attached ticks, preventing their transmission [6]. As a new human LD vaccine candidate targeting OspA (VLA15, see below) enters Phase 3 trials, a central challenge is not only achieving protection but also sustaining it, given that its effectiveness strongly depends on maintaining high antibody titres. Serology monitoring tools may thus become an integral component of the vaccination programme, not only to distinguish between infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, but also to track protective antibody titres over time, thereby ensuring sustained vaccine-induced immunity. During tick feeding, Borrelia alters the expression of its outer surface proteins [4] in response to environmental cues. OspA (yellow) is highly expressed in the midgut of unfed ticks, where it is thought to mediate adherence to the midgut epithelium. As the tick begins feeding, OspA is downregulated, while OspC (orange) is upregulated to facilitate early mammalian invasion. During systemic infection in the vertebrate host, CspZ (blue) becomes expressed and promotes complement evasion through Factor H binding.

The proteins depicted as stylised cartoons were derived from OspA: UniProt = P0CL66; Alphafold = AF-P0CL66-F1-v4; OspC (dimer): UniProt = Q07337; Alphafold = AF-Q07337-F1-v4; CspZ: UniProt = O50665; Alphafold = AF-O50665-F1-v4.

The vaccine OspA antigen sequence was derived from North American B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, offering limited coverage of the diverse Borrelia genospecies that cause LD in Europe (e.g., B. afzelii, B. garinii). The vaccine was later withdrawn from the market in 2002 due to public concerns and limited uptake, despite clinical validation of its safety and effectiveness [7]. These concerns arose mainly due to a potential autoimmune reaction: a segment of B. burgdorferi OspA shares sequence homology with human leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (hLFA-1) within the OspA C-terminus, raising a molecular mimicry hypothesis for treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis in people carrying the HLA-DR4 antigen [8]. The second-generation LD vaccine candidate (VLA15) directly addresses both issues: it provides a broad genospecies coverage and eliminates concerns about autoimmunity. VLA15, co-developed by Valneva and Pfizer, is a multivalent subunit vaccine candidate designed to provide broad protection against LD by targeting six OspA serotypes (serotypes 1–6). These serotypes represent the major Borrelia genospecies, causing human infection across North America and Europe [9]. To achieve broad serotype coverage, VLA15 incorporates three recombinant fusion proteins, each composed of the C-terminal OspA domains from two serotypes: serotypes 1 and 2, serotypes 3 and 4, and serotypes 5 and 6 (Fig 2). The domains within each fusion protein are connected by a 21-amino acid linker derived from two segments of the N-terminal region of OspA serotype 1 (Fig 2). Additionally, the OspA antigens in VLA15 have been optimised by introducing a single disulfide bond into every subunit to enhance structural stability. OspA proteins are natively lipidated at an N-terminal cysteine, tethering them to the plasma membrane of the spirochete [10]. In vaccine formulations, retaining this lipidation markedly enhanced immunogenicity and protective efficacy [11]. To enable this lipidation at the N-terminus of the mutant OspA C-terminal fragment heterodimers, a lipidation signal sequence derived from the Escherichia coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) was introduced at their N-terminus and immediately followed C-terminally by a CSS peptide (patent publication number: WO2014006226A1). This provides the N-terminal cysteine for lipidation after signal peptide cleavage. Lastly, the hLFA-1-like fragment in OspA serotype 1 was replaced by the corresponding region from OspA serotype 2 (summarised in [12]). These designs create recombinant fusion proteins that are structurally distinct from native OspA yet retain immunological characteristics critical for vaccine effectiveness. The map (top panel) highlights the geographic distribution of the predominant Borrelia species associated with human Lyme disease across regions: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in North America, and B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in Europe and Asia. These species correspond to six predominant OspA serotypes (1–6), which underpin the multivalent OspA vaccine design and enable broad coverage across the dominant, geographically diverse Borrelia genospecies. The distribution map is based on the CDC’s Lyme Disease Case Map (June 2025) and LD surveillance data from Canada [32], overlayed on a base map sourced from naturalearthdata.com. The schematic (bottom panel) illustrates the VLA15 vaccine composition, which includes OspA C-terminal domains from serotypes 1–6 connected, via a 21-amino acid linker, which is derived by merging two loop regions of the N-terminal domain from serotype 1 (residues 65-GTSDKNNGSG-74 and 43-SKEKNKDGKYS-53, in which residue D53 has been mutated to S). Each subunit contains an introduced disulfide bond to increase stability. To avoid hLFA-1 mimicry, the serotype 1 hLFA-1-like epitope was replaced with the corresponding serotype 2 sequence.

Vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies from the human host would then be drained by attached ticks, as part of their blood meal, would bind its cognate antigen, neutralising Borrelia during tick feeding, and ultimately block transmission of Borrelia to humans [13]. This comes with a principal limitation of lacking an anamnestic response, leaving host immunity almost entirely dependent on sustained antibody titres rather than memory responses. The fact is also that OspA is not essential during mammalian infection [14]. In order for the vaccine to be effective, it must thus act with near-perfect efficiency at high-titre levels to sustain its capacity to neutralise spirochetes during tick feeding. If spirochetes escape neutralisation in the tick and enter the vertebrate host, OspA is downregulated and is no longer displayed on the Borrelia surface, leaving vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies without a target and making protection unlikely at that stage. This property also precludes the vaccine’s use for post-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention. Based on the LYMErix Phase 3 trial, the CDC concluded that an anti-OspA (LA-2 antigen) antibody titre greater than 1,200 ELISA units/mL was correlated with 1-year protection against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the United States [15]. The breakthrough infections that occurred were mainly associated with individuals with lower titres, identifying antibody concentration as the principal correlate of vaccine efficacy. For the multivalent VLA15 vaccine (VALOR Phase 3, NCT05477524), which targets six OspA C-terminal domains, protective thresholds have not yet been defined. Because VLA15 covers multiple Borrelia species rather than a single U.S. strain covered by LYMErix, protective levels may need to be determined for each OspA serotype or at least for the dominant one. Notably, anti-OspA antibody levels after VLA15 vaccination decline substantially within months, particularly in elderly individuals, who often generate lower and shorter-lived titres [16,17]. In Europe, where Borrelia isolates causing breakthrough infections are rarely genotyped, such thresholds will require further refinement. Establishing serotype-specific minimal protective titres could improve serology-guided booster scheduling and support data-driven vaccine optimisation. The fact that VLA15 includes only the C-termini of OspA proteins, and that anti-OspA-antibodies are rare in sera as a response to LD infection [18], allows tracking levels of vaccine-induced antibodies. Even though the whole OspA protein is immunogenic and can, in rare cases, be exposed during infection to host immunity, hallmarking, e.g., prolonged arthritis [19], the presence of anti-OspA IgG antibodies in sera will be mostly indicative of vaccine-induced antibodies in vaccinated individuals. We recommend revising current diagnostic antigen sets, which typically contain full-length OspA (frequently derived from multiple Borrelia strains in Europe), to instead include distinct N- and C-terminal fragments of OspA (Fig 3). Such antigenic microchip, for example, would contain: (1) established antigens to flag past or present LD [20], (2) the N-terminus of OspA to detect the rare anti-OspA responses observed in prolonged episodes of LD (thereby identifying individuals for whom OspA-based vaccination should not be recommended), and (3) the C-terminus of OspA that would monitor the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies for people with negative N-terminus OspA immunodetection (Fig 3). For quantitative readouts, titration of OspA C-termini would allow tracking of post-vaccination levels of antibodies (Fig 3). Once validated correlates of protection are established, this approach could guide seasonal vaccine strategies and ensure protection during peak tick activity. A) During mammalian infection, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) expresses surface proteins that elicit a specific humoral immune response. Commonly targeted antigens include VlsE, OspC, and flagellin (p41), whereas antibodies against OspA are rarely detected (≤15% of cases). B) The VLA15 vaccine is composed only of the C-termini of OspA of 6 B. burgdorferi s.l. serotypes. C) The current standard two-tier testing for LD typically combines an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a mixture of selected antigens or a single-antigen (e.g., VlsE) with a confirmatory strip-blot assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against multiple Borrelia antigens. D) These strip blots often contain full-length OspA antigens, which will also detect antibodies in vaccinated individuals following VLA15 implementation. E) Diagnostic immunostrips can be multiplexed using microchip-based technologies, which can provide more targeted and detailed information by distinguishing infection-induced from vaccine-induced antibody responses. Provided a vaccinated person is sero-negative (grey) for acute (e.g., VlsE) or prolonged LD (N-terminal OspA) infection, such individual will be possibly eligible for VLA15 vaccination. These technologies can also enable quantitative, time-resolved tracking of vaccine-induced antibody levels (C-terminal OspA, yellow). Signal intensity will either indicate the anticipated protective level or significant waning of vaccine induced antibody titres, indicating a call for a vaccine booster. Inclusion of acute infection antigens (e.g., VlsE) in these multiplex immunoassays will also allow to detect breakthrough infections. The correlation between circulating antibody levels and the occurrence of LD infections will help define the precise threshold of protective immunity.

The correlation between circulating antibody levels and the occurrence of LD infections will help define the precise threshold of protective immunity. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013747.g003 This opportunity currently applies only to the VLA15 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines mRNA-1975 and mRNA-1982 developed by ModernaTX, Inc. (ClinicalTrials.gov: ID NCT05975099), code for full-length proteins (WO2024215721A1) that will prevent any potential opportunity for differentiation of vaccine-induced and rare infection-induced anti-OspA IgG antibodies in the sera. It is important to realise that with the introduction of the OspA-based VLA15 vaccine, modified two-tier testing (MTTT) currently using whole cell lysate [21] will also become susceptible to vaccine-induced seroreactivity in uninfected patients. Therefore, platforms with informative single-antigens [22] or single-epitopes [23,24] may offer a more practical tool, with detailed precision, for the diagnosis of infections and determination of vaccine titres. Many Borrelia infections in endemic regions remain subclinical and untreated, resulting in seropositive individuals without a documented history of LD. While there is currently no publicly available efficacy or safety data for VLA15 in individuals with a history of LD, it is reasonable to expect that future studies or post-licensure monitoring will address this gap. To minimise safety risks and ensure that immunogenicity data reflect naïve populations, phase 1 [16,25–27], phase 2 [16,26,27], and the ongoing phase 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05477524) clinical trials of the VLA15 vaccine have excluded participants with detectable anti-Borrelia antibodies, as well as individuals with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory arthritis. Although no vaccine-associated adverse effects have been reported in seronegative individuals enrolled in these trials, theoretical concerns remain regarding possible inflammatory responses in previously Lyme-exposed individuals. This is likely due to potential immune recognition of residual OspA antigen in immune-privileged sites, such as synovial tissue. Therefore, more data need to be collected on the vaccination of people with a history of LD, or pre-vaccination immune-screening, using conventional or emerging serological tools in future clinical practice to identify individuals with prior exposure. The inclusion of Borrelia antigens expressed during early human infection offers a promising avenue for the design of multi-antigen LD vaccines. Such strategies could synergistically combine OspA-based transmission-blocking components with antigens targeting transmitted Borrelia that breached anti-OspA protection. OspC emerges as a promising candidate due to its crucial role during the initial phase of mammalian infection [28]. OspC is markedly upregulated upon spirochete transmission to the vertebrate host, facilitating successful colonisation and eliciting a robust antibody response. However, its utility in vaccine development is complicated by significant antigenic variability, with numerous OspC serotypes circulating in endemic Borrelia populations. To address this diversity, “chimeritope” vaccines have already been successfully developed for canines. These fusion proteins incorporate immunogenic epitopes from multiple OspC variants into a single, mosaic antigen. The canine Lyme vaccine, VANGUARDcrLyme (Zoetis), exemplifies this approach by including a chimeric OspC antigen (Ch14), derived from segments of 14 distinct OspC types, alongside OspA. This strategy induces antibodies with broad reactivity, providing extensive protection [29]. Murine models have confirmed that OspC chimeritopes similarly generate cross-protective antibody responses, emphasising their potential translational relevance to human vaccines [29]. Critically, incorporating OspC, or other antigens expressed early during host infection into OspA-based vaccines, may enable a rapid anamnestic response to these antigens upon spirochete entry into the host. Another promising vaccine candidate is the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 (also known as CRASP-2 or CspZ). Although CspZ is known to bind the complement regulator factor H (FH), it thus blocks activation of complement on the surface of the spirochete. CspZ-YA, a double mutant (two-point mutations) of CspZ from B. burgdorferi, has been engineered to lack its native FH-binding activity, thereby exposing epitopes that are otherwise shielded by FH. By further introducing protein-stabilising mutations into CspZ-YA, namely I183Y or C187S, a robust bactericidal antibody response is observed, which protects against infection in mouse models [30]. These results suggest that either CspZ-YAC187S or CspZ-YAI183Y would be promising components for inclusion into future multivalent LD vaccines. It should be noted that while these antigens (e.g., OspC, CspZ) show strong potential in preclinical studies, to date, no multi-antigen vaccines have entered human clinical trials; all clinical-stage candidates remain OspA-based. Lyme disease prevention is entering a transformative phase. The VLA15 vaccine represents the most advanced candidate to date, overcoming historical limitations by broadening genospecies coverage and resolving safety concerns. Yet, the effectiveness of OspA-based vaccines depends fundamentally on maintaining high antibody titres at the time of tick exposure. Emerging miniaturised high-throughput serological microarray platforms, designed to differentiate infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, could not only enable robust multi-epitope LD diagnosis but also incorporate epitopes for monitoring vaccine-induced titres. Such data-based booster scheduling may help sustain protective immunity through each tick season [31], preventing breakthrough infections. However, defining human correlates of protection remains a key unmet need. With most technical limitations in vaccine design now resolved, the integration of data-guided, personalised serology may enhance the likelihood of success for the second generation of vaccine strategies capable of preventing Lyme disease in humans.
