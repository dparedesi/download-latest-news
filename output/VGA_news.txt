December 05, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. SAN DIEGO, Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: KTOS), a Technology Company in the Defense, National Security and Global Markets and an industry-leading provider of high-performance, jet-powered unmanned aerial systems, today announced the successful performance of a recent series of flight tests of the United States Marine Corps’ XQ-58A Valkyrie, manufactured by Kratos. These flights and exercises were conducted jointly earlier this year by Kratos, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Autodyne, the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force (USAF). Kratos’ XQ-58A Flies in Joint Emerald Flag Exercise A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94bd48b4-0b84-4660-8063-18330361338a The test was conducted as a part of Emerald Flag 2024—a multiservice and multi-domain training exercise. During this milestone event, the USMC demonstrated cooperative kill chain closure between crewed and uncrewed strike platforms, specifically Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie, for the first time in a large-force exercise. The USMC kill chain closure demonstration, hosted in a joint force environment, showcased collaborative electronic warfare (EW) operations in addition to newly added tactical data link capabilities. These tests mark the first time the Department of Defense (DoD) controlled an XQ-58 using expeditionary methods. Initial results indicate the system met threshold requirements for autonomously exchanging relevant tactical information. These capabilities significantly enhance the Marine Air-Ground Task Force’s ability to conduct integrated and joint operations, contributing to the USMC’s mission to deter conflict and, when necessary, defeat enemies in complex and evolving scenarios. These flights were conducted in partnership with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) AIRWorks, and industry partners. Flight test support was provided by the 40th Flight Test Squadron, the 46th Test Squadron, the 96th Test Wing, and the Marine Operational Test & Evaluation Squadron 1 (VMX-1). The latest event was witnessed by the USMC Deputy Commandant of Aviation, Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, as well as officers and civilians from the Marine Corps Cunningham Group, Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Expeditionary and Maritime Aviation-Advanced Development Team (XMA-ADT), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). As the USMC advances towards the operational fielding of a new uncrewed system, Kratos is at the vanguard of technological advancement to ensure the Marines have the best tactical asset to complement their fleet of F-35B aircraft. Flying alongside four USMC F-35B aircraft from the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 214 (VMFA-214) and two USAF F-15E/EX aircraft from the 40th Flight Test Squadron, the USMC XQ-58A operated under vehicle-level autonomy to perform maneuvers in a simulated threat environment. The Valkyrie’s on-board sensors identified and geolocated relevant threats, and simultaneously passed targeting data to collaborating air and ground platforms over tactical networks. During the exercise, the XQ-58A was also flown by a USMC aviator, and control was passed between air and ground control methods which can command multiple Valkyries simultaneously. This demonstration of the XQ-58A’s ability to support crewed-uncrewed teaming and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) marks a significant milestone in the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Unmanned Aerial System Expeditionary (MUX) Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR) development. Steve Fendley, President of Kratos Unmanned Systems Division, said, “We're proud to be leading the industry effort to demonstrate and deliver this critical collaborative uncrewed aircraft capability. The mission capability demonstrated during the latest exercise – enabling Marine Corps pilots to lead a strike package of multiple Valkyries seamlessly transferring C2 between crewed aircraft and expeditionary ground control stations, to autonomously accomplish the mission while reducing risk exposure – will be a force multiplier. Our integrated, autonomous collaborative platform, jet-powered aircraft systems truly validate the DoD's goal of achieving effective, survivable, affordable mass.” Flying since 2019, the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie is a high-performance, runway-flexible tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of long-range flights at high-subsonic speeds. The Valkyrie can serve as a loyal wingman, conduct single unmanned aircraft system operations, or operate in swarms. Combining affordability, survivability, long-range, high-subsonic speeds, maneuverability, and ability to carry flexible mission kit configurations and mix of lethal weapons from its internal weapons bay and wing stations, the XQ-58A provides unmatched operational flexibility at an affordable price for multiple DoD customers.

Title: Salinas Loses $5.5 Billion in a Day on Elektra Slump

(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Grupo Elektra tumbled 71% on Monday as trading resumed following a months-long halt, wiping off $5.5 billion from the fortune of billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego and pushing him out of the world’s top 500 wealthiest list. Shares of Elektra ended the session at 274.27 pesos per share compared to a 944.95 price where they last traded in July. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores said in a filing early Monday that it had been asked by regulators to let the stock trade even it blew past circuit breakers in the premarket auction — a mechanism which had barred it from resuming for days. Trading resumed even as Elektra said in a statement before market open that it had a court order keeping it blocked, adding that anyone dealing in the stock could be held responsible. “It is our obligation to reiterate that the resumption of trading in these, in addition to causing irreparable damage, could involve shares obtained improperly,” Grupo Salinas spokesman Luciano Pascoe said in a response to questions. 4-Month Halt Salinas himself had triggered the trading halt back in July, alleging he was a victim of potential fraud. His lawyers claimed a creditor had used the company’s shares to fund a $110 million loan, and later discovered most of the shares appeared to have been sold, pushing the stock price down. The rest, they say, was pocketed by the creditor, who has denied any wrongdoing. “It is important to remember that any eventual consequences are the exclusive responsibility of their buyers and sellers,” Pascoe said. After a month of no trading, Elektra got booted from the country’s main stock gauge. Now, it’s facing selling pressure from exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Inc and The Vanguard Group, which need to dump shares. Volume on Monday surged to a more than seven year high. Officials had been trying for days to lift the halt, but the low bids immediately triggered a market circuit breaker designed to limit volatility, suspending it again. Lawyers for Salinas had argued to keep the stock from trading, saying it would cause “irreparable damage to the company.” $5.5 Billion Salinas’ nearly 75% stake in the company is now worth about $2.2 billion, down from $7.6 billion on Friday. That gives him a net worth of $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Salinas, 69, has long been the third-wealthiest Mexican behind Carlos Slim and German Larrea. Heading into this week, he was ranked the world’s 262nd-richest-person by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With the plunge, Salinas is no longer on the list of the 500 wealthiest people. Beyond Salinas’ stake, ETFs and other index-tracking funds hold around 4 million in shares out of 47.8 million in free floating shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the slump is vaporizing Salinas’ wealth on paper — which had been a key fixture of his ability to take loans out against Elektra’s value — it could make a bid to de-list the shares easier. Elektra said last week it would hold a meeting in late December to discuss taking the company private. --With assistance from Carolina Wilson.

Title: Hay más de 1.300 dominios de primer nivel (además de los genéricos y de países) algunos de ellos muy curiosos
URL: https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/internet/1300-dominios-primer-nivel-curiosos.html
Time Published: 2024-12-02T13:18:03Z
Full Content:
Me encontré un enlace oficial y actualizado a la lista de dominios de primer nivel de la IANA (la Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, que se encarga de estas cosas). Allí se indican esos dominios «extra» que se inventaron además de los de los países (.es, .pt, .ft, etcétera) y los genéricos de toda la vida (.com, .net, etcétera), lo que hizo que empezaran a aparecer otros nuevos y originales con denominaciones interesantes, además de –ya puestos– las marcas comerciales. Tal vez nunca te hayas topado con uno o no te hayas fijado por dónde navegabas: funcionan exactamente igual que los normales y también se les pueden asignar direcciones de correo como a los de toda la vida. Echarle un vistazo es realmente interesante, porque los hay a cual más curioso: Para empezar, hay muchos que empiezan por XN-- que se corresponden con palabras que incluyen caracteres especiales: la ñ, o de idiomas como el árabe o el hindi. Ese código se conoce como Punycode y proviene del RFC3492, que convierte Unicode a caracteres válidos en esos dominios. Luego están otros como .gal y .eus para Galicia y Euskadi, pero no en cambio otros que se solicitaron en su día como .telefonica o .terra (d.e.p.) En cambio .zara, que se pidió en esa época (2010s) sí que está. Se decía que esos dominios costaban más de 25.000 dólares al año y unos 185.000 cuando se solicitaban por primera vez. ¿Qué otras marcas están por ahí presentes? Alibaba, Airtel, AmericanExpress, Apple, Barcalys, Bloomberg, Cisco, Epson, Ericsson, Ferrari, Ferrero, Gallo, Google, IBM, LaCaixa, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Mango, Omega, Panasonic, Philips, Yahoo, Walmart, Windows y Zara… así a simple vista. También hay genéricos como .adult, .business, .date, .earth, .energy, .global, .holiday, .map, .movie, .security o .viajes (el único que he visto en español). El hecho de que sitios como Iberia.viajes no lleven a Iberia ya dice mucho de lo que se puede esperar de algunos de estos dominios, para sorpresa de nadie.
