January 23, 2026 08:27 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global food safety testing market was valued at US$ 21.24 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 44.74 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 8.63% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The food safety testing market is being propelled forward by a pressing and sobering reality: the high incidence of foodborne illnesses worldwide. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in every six Americans falls victim to foodborne illnesses each year. This translates to roughly 48 million cases annually, with devastating consequences that include approximately 3,000 deaths. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/food-safety-testing-market The widespread prevalence of foodborne illnesses has galvanized regulatory agencies and industry leaders alike to intensify their focus on food safety. Regulatory bodies have responded by enforcing stricter standards and mandating comprehensive testing protocols designed to detect contaminants at every stage of the food supply chain—from production and processing to distribution and retail. Cutting-Edge Technologies Reshaping Food Safety Testing Technological advancements in food safety testing methodologies are revolutionizing how contaminants are detected, dramatically improving both accuracy and efficiency. Among the most impactful innovations are DNA-based techniques and rapid testing methods, which have transformed traditional testing paradigms. These state-of-the-art approaches enable food safety professionals to identify pathogens and chemical hazards with unprecedented precision, often delivering results within hours rather than days. DNA-based testing methodologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have become indispensable tools in the fight against foodborne illnesses. By targeting the genetic material of pathogens, these techniques offer highly specific and sensitive detection, capable of identifying even low levels of contamination that might elude conventional methods. Rapid testing technologies complement DNA-based methods by providing quick and dependable results directly at points of production or distribution. Techniques such as immunoassays, biosensors, and portable diagnostic devices empower food producers and regulators to conduct on-site testing with minimal delay. This immediacy allows for real-time decision-making and swift corrective actions, reducing the likelihood of contaminated products reaching consumers. Contract Research Organizations: Pillars of the Food Safety Testing Ecosystem Contract Research Organizations (CROs) have become indispensable players in the global food safety testing market, serving as specialized partners that address the complex and evolving needs of the food industry. By 2024, over 1,000 CROs worldwide will be providing a wide spectrum of food safety testing services, highlighting the industry’s growing dependence on these expert third-party providers. CROs cater to a broad range of testing requirements, adapting to the multifaceted challenges of modern food production and distribution. As food supply chains become increasingly global and intricate, the demand for precise and timely testing has surged. These organizations bring specialized expertise and advanced technologies to the table, enabling food companies to comply with stringent safety regulations and respond rapidly to potential contamination risks. A striking example of the CRO sector’s growth and sophistication is Boston University’s high-throughput clinical testing laboratory, which processed an impressive 45,000 food and clinical tests weekly in 2024. This achievement underscores the widespread adoption of automation and high-capacity testing systems within the industry. Such innovations enable CROs to deliver faster, more accurate results, meeting the urgent need for speed and precision in food safety testing. Microbial Testing: The Cornerstone of Food Safety Microbial testing holds a commanding 36% share of the global food safety testing market, reflecting its critical role in detecting and preventing foodborne illnesses. As pathogens continue to spark high-profile food recalls, the importance of microbial analysis has only deepened. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated foods were responsible for 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for rigorous microbial surveillance and intervention. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exemplifies this heightened vigilance, processing a record 1.2 million microbial assays in 2024—an increase of 140,000 samples compared to 2023. This surge highlights the expanding scope of microbial testing as a frontline defense against harmful pathogens. Across Asia, similar momentum is evident: Japan’s Ministry of Health conducted thorough examinations of 880,000 consignments following a Listeria outbreak in frozen vegetables, demonstrating rapid response capabilities. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed microbial testing, with rapid molecular tools like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays becoming fundamental to routine inspections. Thermo Fisher Scientific’s shipment of 5.4 billion PCR reactions worldwide in 2024 is a telling indicator of this trend—enough to screen every kilogram of exported meat twice over. These molecular techniques enable faster, more precise detection of pathogens compared to traditional methods, allowing for quicker interventions and reducing the risk of contaminated products reaching consumers. Data-Driven Revolution: Transforming Food Safety Risk Assessment The integration of data-driven methodologies is reshaping the landscape of food safety risk assessment, marking a pivotal shift in how professionals identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential hazards. Traditional approaches are giving way to sophisticated technologies that leverage advanced data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). These tools process massive datasets drawn from diverse sources—ranging from historical testing records and supply chain logistics to environmental monitoring and even social media trends—providing a holistic view of food safety risks. The power of machine learning and AI lies in their ability to uncover complex patterns and correlations within seemingly unrelated data points, turning raw information into actionable insights. These technologies facilitate continuous learning and adaptation, improving risk assessments over time as new data flows in. Consequently, food safety professionals can make more informed decisions, prioritize resources effectively, and minimize the likelihood of foodborne illnesses. North America: A Vanguard in Food Safety Testing and Recall Management North America continues to lead the global food safety testing market, driven by a stringent regulatory framework and a proactive stance on managing food recalls. The United States, under the combined oversight of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), managed an estimated 296 to 300 food recalls in 2024. These recalls were predominantly triggered by undeclared allergens and contamination from pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli—hazards that pose significant risks to public health. Parallel to the U.S., Canada’s Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued 89 food safety advisories within the same timeframe, reflecting a similarly vigilant approach to protecting public health. These advisories demonstrate the region’s commitment to early detection and swift response to potential food safety threats, reinforcing North America’s reputation for rigorous oversight and consumer protection in the food supply chain. The regulatory environment in North America is characterized not only by aggressive recall management but also by the widespread adoption of advanced food testing technologies. While annual assay volumes remain confidential, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) alone performed more than 1.2 million laboratory tests on meat, poultry, and egg products in 2024. This highlights the scale and intensity of testing efforts to ensure food safety. The region boasts a strong laboratory network, including over 1,200 CLIA-certified food safety testing laboratories across the U.S., complemented by an increasing number of in-house testing facilities within food manufacturing plants, enabling rapid and precise quality control.

January 23, 2026 06:08 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Discount Brokerage Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Discount Brokerage Market is projected to expand from USD 26.14 billion in 2025 to USD 37.16 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 6.04%. These financial intermediaries specialize in executing security orders at reduced commission rates, catering primarily to investors who function independently of personalized advisory services. The market's expansion is fundamentally propelled by the democratization of financial access, where technological breakthroughs and the widespread availability of mobile devices have drastically reduced entry barriers for retail participants. Additionally, this upward trend is bolstered by increasing levels of financial literacy and a growing preference for cost-efficient, self-directed investment platforms. According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the global trading volume of listed securities rose by 9.6% in the first half of 2024, indicating strong and continued investor participation in equity markets. Despite this positive growth trajectory, the market faces substantial hurdles related to strict regulatory compliance and the need for operational resilience. Global regulatory authorities are implementing more rigorous standards concerning digital engagement strategies and risk management to safeguard inexperienced investors against market volatility. This intensifying regulatory environment requires significant capital allocation toward compliance infrastructure and restricts the use of certain aggressive customer acquisition tactics. Consequently, these pressures can compress profit margins and hinder the pace at which firms can establish operations in new jurisdictions. Market Drivers A significant increase in retail investor participation and adoption among millennials serves as a primary driver for the discount brokerage industry, causing a fundamental shift in client demographics. This momentum is defined by a new generation entering the market, empowered by accessible educational materials and a cultural trend favoring early financial independence. The arrival of younger demographics has compelled brokerages to adjust their service models to support smaller account balances and higher trading frequencies, departing from traditional wealth management frameworks. The scale of this retail capital accumulation is evident in recent financial reports; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., assets under custody rose by 76% year-over-year to reach $152.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the massive influx of capital from this growing segment. The development of mobile-first and user-centric trading platforms acts as the essential technological foundation facilitating this demographic transition. Brokerage firms are focusing on intuitive interface designs and seamless mobile app functionality to satisfy clients who require immediate market access and execution capabilities. By prioritizing digital experience and minimizing friction in the trading process, these platforms encourage higher engagement and trade volumes among self-directed investors. The magnitude of this activity is reflected in key operational metrics; for instance, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. reported a 46% increase in Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) to 2.823 million in October 2024 compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the extensive reach of these digital access points is illustrated by The Charles Schwab Corporation, which reported record total client assets of $9.92 trillion during the third quarter of 2024, highlighting the vast scale of the modern self-directed investment landscape. Market Challenges Stringent requirements for regulatory compliance and operational resilience imposed by global authorities currently serve as a major constraint on the Global Discount Brokerage Market. As regulators enforce strict standards regarding digital engagement and risk management, brokerage firms are forced to direct significant capital toward establishing advanced compliance infrastructures rather than investing in product innovation or geographical growth. This reallocation of resources results in higher operational costs, which directly undermine the low-commission business model essential to discount brokerages. Additionally, prohibitions on aggressive acquisition strategies, such as gamified user interfaces, restrict the ability of firms to rapidly attract the next generation of retail investors, effectively slowing the market's organic growth rate. The severity of this regulatory landscape is highlighted by the increasing frequency of punitive actions taken against non-compliant entities. According to the North American Securities Administrators Association, state securities regulators executed 1,183 enforcement actions and secured over $69 million in fines in 2024 to address regulatory infractions. These enforcement measures emphasize the intensified scrutiny directed at the sector, establishing substantial barriers to entry for new competitors and compelling existing players to prioritize regulatory compliance over market share expansion, thereby impeding the overall development of the brokerage landscape. Market Trends The incorporation of AI-driven predictive analytics and hybrid robo-advisory services is transforming discount brokerages into comprehensive wealth management centers. Firms are increasingly integrating automated planning tools and predictive insights directly into trading interfaces to provide retail investors with access to sophisticated portfolio strategies. This shift toward a technology-driven advisory model meets the growing demand for personalized guidance that extends beyond simple execution, thereby fostering deeper user engagement. The extent of this adoption is substantial; according to Fidelity Investments' Q3 2024 update, the firm logged 7.1 million Customer Planning Interactions year-to-date, representing an 11% year-over-year increase, which validates the sector's effective pivot toward digitally enabled advisory solutions. Concurrently, the inclusion of direct cryptocurrency and digital asset access is redefining the asset composition within the market. To compete with specialized exchanges and appeal to younger demographics, traditional brokers are rapidly embedding spot crypto trading into their primary ecosystems. This convergence enables investors to manage both equity and digital asset portfolios within a single, unified environment, which enhances platform retention and diversifies revenue streams. The financial impact of this expansion is evident; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., cryptocurrency revenue jumped 165% year-over-year to $61 million in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the vital role digital assets play in driving growth for modern brokerages.
