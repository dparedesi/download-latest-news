The word out this morning is Pandemic Horde is giving up on whatever plans they may have had and are shutting down, with the remaining central corporations in the alliance, Blessed Beans, Horde Vanguard, Horde Armada, and Coolbeans, joining The Initiative. The announcement on Discord, as posted on Reddit. The closure announcement For those unable to read the tiny text, this is a transcription of the announcement: Johnny Trousersnake – 20:05 @everyone Update Hello friends. Last month we announced a plan to leave coalitions behind and work towards being an independent entity. They say plans never survive contact with the enemy, and as you know, ours didn’t survive the ping. There has been a lot of uncertainty since then – and people want a long-term home, and more space to live and play in. An extended stay in purgatory while attempting a rebuild and navigating today’s political landscape is something we no longer feel is feasible, nor would it be in our players’ best interests. With that in mind, we will be shuttering Pandemic Horde and closing the Alliance. We have been in contact with your CEOs over the past week to discuss this. Several Corporations, including the core of Bless, Armada, Cool Beans and VG will be joining INIT, with others following their own paths. I want to re-assure everyone that regardless of destination, standings and docking access will be maintained for all Corporations during this transition. This will not be a repeat of last month. We’d also like to address asset safety costs which has been a constant pain point for everyone. In just a moment, we’re going to assign every member of every ESI corp that stuck with us over the past month, enough Gobloons to withdraw the most expensive ship from each Dronelands doctrine from asset safety. We hope this helps out. Asset Safety Gobloons were assigned to your ‘main’ on Square. If you do not see them, please double check all of your characters. If you think you may have been missed, please contact one of these names on Discord and specify your character name: [names omitted] Gobloons are the SRP currency used by Pandemic Horde. Participation in operations earns them and you can cash them in for ISK for ship loss reimbursement. Or that is my understanding of the mechanism. So they will be issuing Gabloons to members to convert to ISK to help them get their most expensive hull out of asset safety. Given that asset safety jumped from around 2.5 trillion ISK every month to 19.5 trillion ISK in November, according to the November MER, those Gabloons are probably not going to stretch very far. Back on October 11th of this year Pandemic Horde had 48K capsuleers in its ranks and held 414 systems, making in the second largest alliance in null sec. Top 10 Sov Holding Alliances by Member Count – Oct 11 Then came the collapse, the botched evacuation from the Drone regions, the betrayal of long time allies, and the lack of any real plan for the future, during which two thirds of its members left or were kicked from the alliance. Pandemic Horde Collapse charts – Dec 11, 2025 Even then, sitting with around 16K members, it could have been a power in null sec. But that requires competent and motivated leadership, something the alliance has lacked for some time now. 16K well led pilots can carve out space to live in null sec. 16K capsuleers without leadership are just an aimless mob that will accomplish nothing. So it goes. The Initiative had previously accepted some corporations from Pandemic Horde during the collapse, and offered some temporary space Cloud Ring to what remained of the alliance in order to figure out what to do next. That wasn’t supposed to be a permanent situation, but with a leaderless alliance sleeping on your couch with no hope of survival on its own at this point, I suppose the answer was to either drive them out with a stick or take in the refugees on a more permanent basis. It isn’t often you see an alliance collapse. With even a semblance of a core and some leadership, alliances in much worse positions have come back. TEST has been driven out of its space a few times now and is still lurking… safely under the protective wing of Fraternity to be sure, but they are still around. This move will bulk up The Initiative by nearly 4K more pilots. The remaining 12K pilots left in the alliance… which includes the spy ridden Pandemic Horde Inc and its 8K members, half of what remained of the alliance… will need to figure out their own path. Long time members might be accepted into the four corporations that are merging into The Initiative. And The Initiative may take some additional corps. They already have 24, what difference would a few more make at this point? I listened to some of the town hall they had for the announcement. The message itself was pretty terse, limited pretty much to what was in the written announcement. Most of the 45 minutes was Q&A about what to do next. I am sure it was pretty dejecting for line members, one more indignity on top of almost two months of such failings. I have been covering my own interaction with events in a series of posts if you want some more back story. What happens next remains to be seen. The closure plan is set to be completed almost immediately according to the town hall. At least the whole thing will be commemorated in an special item that you can find as part of the Winter Nexus event. Gone but never forgotten now… Meanwhile, while The Initiative has always been a strong group, part of their strength has been their agility. They are now in the same weight class as their current opponent, Fraternity. Whether the additional pilots help them in their campaign or if their integration into the organization becomes a burden remains to be seen. Related: Huh.. I guess we won. I’m gonna go ahead and still say “we” despite not having played the game in 6 years. LikeLike Good riddance to unironic trash. LikeLike I agree with good riddance. An empire that exists to collect rent and retreat from the enemy deserves to go away. Blah, blah, blah, it’s bad for the members, it’s just a game and they’ll get over it and move on. The biggest downside is the more-than-usual moaning and hand wringing about the mythical blue donut that has been about to ruin nullsec for the last 15 years and This One Event is going to make it real This Time. Again. It’s the second most tired trope after “Eve is dying.” LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!
