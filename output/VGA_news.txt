BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories. While Nike continues to face headwinds, recent campaigns have fueled renewed consumer engagement and helped slow its stock’s decline following years of erosion under previous leadership. In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy. Manuel Arroyo Arroyo steers one of the world’s most iconic—and valuable—CPG brand portfolios at The Coca-Cola Company, the largest non-alcoholic beverage business globally, with more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. He oversees marketing for all five beverage categories, along with Human Insights, Integrated Marketing Experience (IMX), Marketing Operations & Capabilities, and Marketing Performance. Over the past year, Arroyo has accelerated Coca-Cola’s transformation into a data-powered, AI-enabled marketing engine designed for speed, scale and connection with modern consumers. Focused on driving increased brand strength and creative innovation, the company now delivers personalized, real-time content, powering global efforts like the 2025 return of “Share a Coke,” refreshed for Gen Z, and large-scale activations across Asia-Pacific for Lunar New Year. Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally. As of June 6, The Coca-Cola Company’s stock was up over 15% YTD. Mathilde DelHoume Delhoume-Debreu holds one of luxury's most culturally consequential marketing roles, stewarding marketing excellence for a portfolio of more than 75 maisons spanning fashion, jewelry, beauty, and spirits at the world’s most valuable luxury group. Her remit encompasses global brand image, content, media strategy and consumer insight, all funneled through a central “maison of expertise” that helps each LVMH brand—including globally resonant and iconic ones like Louis Vuitton, Moet, Hennessy, and Celine, and Sephora— translate heritage into contemporary and cultural resonance and relevance. Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces. Just as influential is her commitment to innovation and sustainability, and her leadership of the LVMH Innovation Award. She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity. Esi Eggleston Bracey Eggleston Bracey oversees marketing for a global portfolio of more than 400 brands—including icons like Dove, Hellmann’s, and Magnum—for the world’s fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company. With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability.

Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.
