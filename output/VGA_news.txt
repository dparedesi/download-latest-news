Title: Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborate on shared threat actor mapping system

UPDATED 18:37 EDT / JUNE 02 2025 by Duncan Riley CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Microsoft Corp. today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at resolving the longstanding confusion in how cyberthreat actors are identified and tracked across security platforms. The partnership establishes a shared mapping system that aligns adversary attribution across both companies’ threat intelligence ecosystems, eliminating ambiguity caused by inconsistent naming. The problem that both companies are trying to solve is one encountered commonly in cybersecurity news: various companies applying their own name to threat actors, making it sometimes difficult for observers to know what threat actor and ransomware group one report to another is talking about. For example, the well-known Cozy Bear hacking group is also known as Midnight Blizzard, depending on which company is writing the report, which doesn’t exactly make intelligence tracking easy when different names are used. To their credit, CrowdStrike and Microsoft can see the problem and have developed a “Rosetta Stone” for cyber threat intelligence, one that links adversary identifiers across vendor ecosystems without mandating a single naming standard. The idea is that by reducing ambiguity in how adversaries are labeled, the mapping enables defenders to make faster, more confident decisions, correlate threat intelligence across sources and better disrupt threat actor activity before it causes harm. “This is a watershed moment for cybersecurity. Adversaries hide behind both technology and the confusion created by inconsistent naming,” Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, said in a media release. “As defenders, it’s our job to stay ahead and to give security teams clarity on who is targeting them and how to respond.” The collaboration will start with a shared analyst-led effort to harmonize adversary naming between CrowdStrike and Microsoft’s threat research teams. Although only announced today, the companies have already “deconflicted” more than 80 adversaries, including validating threat actors like Microsoft’s Volt Typhoon and CrowdStrike’s VANGUARD PANDA are allegedly Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and that Secret Blizzard and VENOMOUS BEAR refer to the same Russia-nexus adversary. Moving forward, CrowdStrike and Microsoft plan to continue working together to expand this effort, inviting other partners to contribute to and maintain a shared threat actor mapping resource for the global cybersecurity community. “Cybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time, especially in today’s AI-driven era,” said Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security. “Microsoft and CrowdStrike are in ideal positions to help our customers and the wider defender community accelerate the benefits of actionable threat intelligence. Security is a team sport and when defenders can share and react to information faster it makes a difference in how we protect the world.” THANK YOU Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 8 MINS AGO Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters INFRA - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 23 MINS AGO Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform CLOUD - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 HOUR AGO
