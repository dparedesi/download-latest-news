We will examine the intricate web of feedstock supply chains, the global production surge, and the critical policy frameworks propelling its widespread adoption. Key Findings in Green Diesel Market The Dawn of a New Fuel: Green Diesel's Ascendant Market The green diesel market is experiencing a period of unprecedented expansion, driven by a global imperative to mitigate climate change and enhance energy security. Unlike traditional biodiesel, green diesel is a hydrocarbon produced through advanced hydrotreating processes, making it a "drop-in" fuel that requires no engine or infrastructure modifications. This critical advantage is fueling its rapid adoption across the transportation sector. The primary impetus for this growth stems from robust government policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States and the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which mandate the blending of renewable fuels. The increasing shift toward sustainable energy is a core driver for the market's future. Corporate sustainability pledges and the financial incentives created by Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) and carbon credit programs are further accelerating market penetration, creating a powerful economic case for both producers and consumers of this cleaner alternative fuel. This confluence of regulatory pressure, corporate responsibility, and technological readiness has set the stage for a significant scaling of the green diesel industry through 2025 and beyond. Titans of the Tank: Profiling Green Diesel's Production Heavyweights The green diesel market is led by a cadre of established energy giants and specialized biofuel producers who are aggressively expanding their production capabilities. Neste Oyj, a Finnish company, stands as a global leader, reporting substantial revenues of USD 21,601.1 million in 2024. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture between Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients, is a dominant force with a total annual production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons across its two facilities. The DGD plant in Norco, Louisiana, alone boasts a capacity of 982 million gallons per year. In the first quarter of 2024, DGD's sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day, generating an operating income of $190 million. Phillips 66 is another key U.S. player, having expanded its Rodeo, California, plant to a capacity of 800 million gallons in 2024, making it the second-largest facility of its kind in the country. Chevron Corporation also remains a leading producer, with its renewables division contributing to the company's strong Q4 2024 earnings of $3.2 billion. Meanwhile, Repsol of Spain made waves in October 2024 by launching "Nexa," its brand of 100% renewable diesel, directly at its service stations. Unveiling 2025's Most Promising Startup Ventures Beyond the established players, a new wave of innovative startups and targeted investment is broadening the horizons of the green diesel market. In Nebraska, the Love's Heartwell Renewables plant is on schedule to commence operations in 2025, adding 80 million gallons of annual capacity to the U.S. supply. Demonstrating the rapid pace of development, New Rise Renewables began its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in Reno, Nevada, in February 2025, with a capacity to produce up to 3,000 barrels per day. In a significant technological adoption, Acelen Renewables announced in 2024 its use of Honeywell's advanced Ecofining technology, targeting a production of 20,000 barrels per day of both renewable diesel and SAF. A notable investment in Canada's growing market comes from Imperial Oil, an ExxonMobil affiliate, which is investing around $560 million to construct the nation's largest renewable diesel facility; this plant is expected to start producing 20,000 barrels per day in 2025. Highlighting the emergence of novel production pathways, Swiss cleantech firm Synhelion, which creates fuel from solar energy, is poised to enter the market, backed by key offtake agreements. Charting Worldwide Green Diesel Production Volumes Global production in the green diesel market is surging, with the United States taking a decisive lead in capacity expansion. U.S. renewable diesel production capacity was forecast to hit an impressive 5.1 billion gallons per year by the end of 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that daily production would average 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, with a forecast to rise to an average of 234,000 bpd in 2025. This forms part of a larger trend that saw total U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and other biofuels, reach a record 1.39 million barrels per day in 2024. The expansion in renewable diesel was a significant contributor to this record. Despite the strong annual growth, the market experienced some short-term headwinds, with U.S. production dipping to an average of 170,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decrease from the same quarter in the previous year, partly due to profitability challenges. Meanwhile, in Europe, which holds a significant share of the global market, local demand remains robust, with the region consuming more than 95% of its own green diesel production in 2025. From Farm to Fuel Tank: The Diverse Feedstocks Powering Green Diesel The viability and sustainability of the green diesel market hinge on a diverse and resilient feedstock supply chain. Currently, the industry relies heavily on readily available fats, oils, and greases. The most common inputs include recycled animal fats (tallow), used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, and various vegetable oils. These materials are processed to create high-quality fuel that is chemically similar to petroleum diesel. Looking ahead, the industry is actively expanding its feedstock options to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce competition with food production. Significant research and development efforts are focused on so-called second and third-generation feedstocks. These include lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, agricultural grasses, and crop residues, which are abundant and do not impact the food supply. Other promising future sources include municipal solid waste and forest residues, which support the principles of a circular economy by valorizing waste streams. Feedstock certification frameworks like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) are becoming crucial for ensuring transparency and traceability. Tapping into Third-Generation Biofuel Potential in 2025 Among the next wave of feedstocks, algae is generating significant excitement as a potential game-changer for the green diesel market. Considered a third-generation feedstock, algae can be cultivated on non-arable land and can utilize wastewater or saltwater, minimizing competition for land and freshwater resources. Many species of microalgae are particularly promising due to their high lipid oil content, which can range from 20% to as high as 50% of their biomass, making them an ideal raw material for biofuel production. The global market for algae-based green diesel is already gaining traction, reflecting the growing investment in this area. However, scaling up production to commercial levels faces hurdles. Techno-economic analyses conducted in 2025, based on future productivity targets, indicate a high minimum fuel selling price, estimated at 2.2 €/L for fuels produced via lipid extraction and 3.4 €/L for those produced via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Overcoming these cost barriers through continued research and technological advances in cultivation, harvesting, and processing will be key to unlocking algae's full potential. Nations Leading the Green Diesel Charge A handful of nations are at the forefront of the green diesel market revolution, driven by ambitious climate policies and strategic investments. The United States currently leads the world in production capacity, with 22 operational renewable diesel plants as of January 2024 and a projected capacity of 5.1 billion gallons per year by the year's end. In Europe, which collectively accounts for a major share of the global market, countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands are notable leaders. Their progress is underpinned by strong policy frameworks, particularly the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates a greater share of renewables in transport. Finland is also a key player, home to the pioneering global producer Neste. To the north, Canada is making significant strides, highlighted by Imperial Oil's $507 million investment in a renewable diesel facility in Alberta, set to come online in 2025. Brazil is another nation showing increasing interest, with a focus on developing its capacity through the adoption of advanced hydrotreating technology to leverage its vast agricultural resources for fuel production. The Technological Vanguard, Innovations Driving Green Diesel Production Forward Technological advancement is the engine powering the scalability and cost-competitiveness of the green diesel market. The dominant production method is hydrotreating, also known as Hydroprocessed Vegetable Oil (HVO), a process where renewable feedstocks react with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. This technology creates a "drop-in" fuel that is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum diesel. Leading technology providers like Honeywell offer specialized solutions, such as their Ecofining™ process, which was adopted by Acelen Renewables in 2024 for a large-scale project. Following the core hydrotreating step, additional processes like hydrocracking and isomerization are often employed. Hydrocracking breaks down larger molecules to improve fuel efficiency, while isomerization rearranges molecular structures to enhance performance in cold weather. Beyond HVO, researchers and companies are developing other pathways, including catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), which shows great promise for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into refinable bio-oil, a key focus of research in 2024. Sealing the Deal: Key Distribution Pacts and Offtake Agreements of 2024 The growing acceptance of green diesel market is clearly reflected in the increasing number of significant distribution and offtake agreements announced in 2024. These deals are crucial for guaranteeing demand for producers and securing a stable supply of low-carbon fuel for end-users. In a landmark deal for the aviation sector announced in July 2024, Diamond Green Diesel committed to supplying an initial 1 million gallons of neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to World Fuel Services for use by JetBlue at New York's JFK Airport, with an option for 4 million additional gallons. In ground transport, Colonial Oil partnered with Neste in February 2024 to significantly boost the availability of renewable diesel in Savannah, Georgia, and the wider southeastern U.S. European aviation is also advancing, with low-cost carrier easyJet signing a memorandum of understanding with Spanish energy company Moeve in late 2024 for SAF supply on key Spanish routes from 2025 through 2030. Highlighting innovation, Zurich Airport Ltd. signed a pioneering offtake agreement in December 2024 with Synhelion to purchase 30,000 liters of solar-generated diesel annually starting in 2027 for use in its ground vehicle fleet. Customize the Data Scope to Match Your Objectives: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/green-diesel-market The Road Ahead: How 2025 Policies are Shaping Market Acceptance The trajectory of the green diesel market into 2025 and beyond is intrinsically linked to the strength and stability of government policies and corporate commitments. Regulatory frameworks like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have been instrumental in creating the initial demand and investment security for the industry. Similarly, in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has accelerated the adoption of green diesel by mandating its inclusion in the transport fuel mix. The growing demand is not purely policy-driven; corporations are increasingly adopting green diesel to meet their own sustainability targets and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, which see green diesel and SAF as one of the most viable, immediate pathways to decarbonization. As of 2025, the synergy between robust regulatory mandates, financial incentives from carbon markets, and a proactive corporate sector has created a fertile ground for the continued, rapid expansion of the green diesel market.

JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The first half of the year has been all about actives. Now, investors have the numbers to prove it. Active ETF launches and inflows hit record highs in the first half of the year, according to a recent Morningstar report. Increasingly complex strategies — like derivative income and collateralized loan obligation funds — are becoming more popular amid ongoing market turbulence, and continue to eat away at mutual fund market share. Active fixed-income ETFs were also favored by investors. “We’ve seen a lot of interest in active bond ETFs, particularly from big managers like Vanguard, [who] make it very clear that they plan to compete actively in the active bond space,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA. “So we expect a lot more growth there.” There have also been 297 active ETF launches so far this year, with firms like Capital Group, JPMorgan, and T. Rowe Price continuing to build out offerings. Active strategies collectively took in $183 billion in assets, per the report, with derivative income, large blend, and ultrashort bond strategies seeing the most inflows. There was also a jump in the number of ETFs with small- and mid-cap holdings, a trend to look out for, said Stephen Welch, research analyst at Morningstar and author of the report. “That’s obviously a place where capacity matters, so it’d be interesting if there’s uptake there, and if firms continue to launch in that area,” he said. The top-performing funds of H1 2025 in terms of net flows were: The large-blend, ultrashort bond, derivative-income, and large-value categories accounted for roughly half of all active ETF flows so far this year. Still, buffer ETFs, a recent addition to the space, accounted for more than 100 active fund launches in the past six months. Call of Duty. Covered call strategies are another major category to keep an eye on, said Ullal, exemplified by the popularity — especially among older investors nearing retirement — of products like JPMorgan’s JEPQ. “If you look at those strategies, they tend to underperform in a very rapidly rising market, if you’re writing call options on equities,” he said. “But in a market that’s declining or going sideways, it’s an effective strategy to generate income.” The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The first spot Solana ETF came to market last week through a filing under the Securities Act of 1940, unlike competitors who filed under the 1933 Act. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: What analysts and investors want to hear from CFOs this earnings season
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/what-analysts-investors-want-hear-cfo-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T11:38:29Z

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily. Good morning. As the Q2 2025 earnings season begins, CFOs are navigating a landscape shaped by new tariffs, shifting consumer demand, and heightened market scrutiny. The first quarter benefited from a pull-forward of demand ahead of anticipated tariffs. In contrast, the second quarter will test companies’ ability to manage margin pressure, supply chain disruptions, and evolving trade policy risks. Major U.S. banks are among the first to report results this week. For all companies reporting, analysts will be “laser-focused” on how President Donald Trump’s import taxes are affecting corporate profits, according to Morningstar. A key theme is the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, with analysts closely watching for margin pressures, signs of slowing consumer demand, how companies are preparing for new tariffs, and how they are handling levies that have already been implemented. Markets have remained relatively calm heading into Q2, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently reaching new highs. Morningstar notes that Q2 earnings are expected to reveal trends among firms in tariff-affected industries. Companies with higher costs and tighter margins may be forced to absorb more tariff expenses, while those with stronger competitive advantages may be able to pass more costs onto consumers. The momentum that propelled the S&P 500 to nearly an 11% gain in Q2 and more than 7% year-to-date will be tested this week, according to Saira Malik, chief investment officer at global investment manager Nuveen. Malik highlighted in a LinkedIn post on Monday two key dynamics: Q2 earnings reports from the financial sector, and a series of U.S. economic data releases, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for release this morning. Malik adds, “While overall earnings growth is expected to decelerate from last quarter, estimates have stabilized in recent weeks after falling sharply in early April. Still, the Q2 earnings bar is relatively low.” On the economic front, Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard, expects core CPI to increase 0.25% month over month (2.9% year over year) and headline CPI to rise 0.29% month over month (2.6% year over year), reflecting moderate strength following May’s soft print. “While tariff-related pressures are beginning to show in select goods categories in the PCE, the overall pass-through into CPI remains limited for now as firms hold off on retail price hikes,” he said in an emailed statement. Regarding CFO sentiment, Deloitte’s Q2 2025 CFO Signals report, released last week, found that growth expectations declined across every key operational metric, with finance chiefs lowering projections for revenue, earnings, and capital investments. However, Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte’s CFO Program, described the current environment as a recalibration, not a retreat. Finance leaders are doubling down on fundamentals: sharpening focus on growth drivers, managing controllable risks, and staying active in M&A. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leeny Oberg, CFO and EVP of development at Marriott International (No. 171) has decided to retire effective March 31, 2026, after spending more than two decades with the U.S. hotel operator. Oberg, CFO since 2016, will be succeeded by Jen Mason, who joined Marriott in 1992 and currently serves as global officer, treasurer and risk management. Mason is also a former CFO of the U.S. and Canada at the company. Shawn Hill was promoted to the role of EVP and chief development officer, effective Jan. 1. Oberg has been in that role since February 2023. Every Friday morning, the weekly Fortune 500 Power Moves column tracks Fortune 500 company C-suite shifts—see the most recent edition. Mark Mesler has stepped down from his position as CFO of Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR), effective July 7, according to an SEC filing. Mesler had been on medical leave since September 2024. During his absence, Priya Gupta has served as CFO and acting principal financial officer. Gupta will continue in these roles. Harsh Rungta will also remain as SVP of finance and chief accounting officer and principal accounting officer. Sarah C. Young was appointed CFO at Bell Partners, a privately held company specializing in apartment investment and management, and will succeed John Tomlinson upon his planned retirement effective Aug. 22. Young joined the company on July 14 and will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners. After his retirement, Tomlinson will remain as an advisor to the company through the end of 2025. Young previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of homebuilder Lennar, where she worked for 10 years. Before that, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)’s Q2 2025 Quarterly Survey found that 62% of directors cite shifting economic conditions as the top business issue for boards. Also, in the findings from the 305 directors surveyed, AI now outranks cybersecurity, supply chains, and even talent competition in terms of business issues. Although AI remains a top focus, NACD says it is clear from survey responses that organizations are in very different positions with respect to AI adoption and implementation. Some companies are in the middle of the implementation of AI projects, working to “move beyond pilots to deployments” or focusing on improving governance of AI, including determining “where it can be implemented and why, and internal controls around verification of output.” “Elon Musk spent months slashing federal contracts—Now his AI company is celebrating a $200M Pentagon contract and new unit to get government business” is a new Fortune report by Jessica Mathews. Elon Musk’s xAI, a two-year-old AI company, said in a blog post Monday that it has launched a new division, called “Grok with Government,” and signed a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense, Mathews writes. xAI also announced that it had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products will now be available for purchase across every government office and agency.
