Trump administration officials vowed to keep US coal power plants operating, casting it as an imperative to meet surging electricity demand and drive a revival of the nation’s industrial base. “The goal is 100% open,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “That’s the standard we’re operating against.” Burgum’s comment came during the first meeting of Trump’s newly reconstituted National Coal Council, an advisory panel that Joe Biden let lapse during his presidency. President Donald Trump, by contrast, has sought to engineer a coal resurgence in his second term, including byrequiring some power plants to keep burning the fuel. The bullish Trump administration predictions for America’s coal — and the power plants that rely on it — contrast with a more skeptical view from analysts who point to generation from natural gas and renewables. The message comes as the Trump administration addresses concerns about rising electricity prices and consumer costs, an issue that weighs heavily on Republicans’ bid to keep control of the House and Senate in November’s elections. Focusing on the existing coal fleet works better as a short-term strategy, according to Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis. While they’re generating power now, many of the plants are old and will require significant maintenance if the administration expects them to remain in service for a while. And in the meantime, utilities will be able to turn to gas and nuclear capacity that will likely become more widely available over the next several years. “We need the power, and the coal units are there now,” said Blumenfeld. “But in the long term, they’re up against an aging coal fleet.” In a move aimed at addressing some of these issues, the Energy Department is putting aside as much as $525 million to upgrade or build coal-fired power plants, a move criticized by environmental groups. Trump has moved quickly to dial back regulations and subsidies that have encouraged emissions-free renewable power. Under Trump, the Energy Department also has issued emergency orders requiring some coal plants to keep running, and the Environmental Protection Agency recently rejected a bid by Colorado to force the closing of one of its coal plants in the central part of the state. Meanwhile, the Interior Department has also moved to open more federal land for coal leasing in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. “Seventeen gigawatts of coal generation are open today that would not have been open,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, attributing some of that shift to the short-termemergency ordersforcing plants to operate. “You will not see those coal plants close during this administration.” Wright said utilities are now calling the Energy Department in a bid to keep plants running, despite some states pushing to shutter the facilities. Burgum, who leads Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, went even further, predicting new coal plant construction — though many analysts have foreclosed the possibility. The National Coal Council meeting on Thursday included discussion of options for maintaining and growing the nation’s fleet of coal plants, as well as opportunities to expand exports of the fossil fuel. The roughly 60-member panel includes executives from some of the nation’s top coal producers, such as Peabody Energy, Warrior Met Coal Inc., Hallador Energy Co. and Nacco Industries Inc.,as well as power utilities and co-operatives such as FirstEnergy Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. Joe Craft, chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners, a Trump donor, is a member; Jim Grech, CEO of Peabody Energy is chairing the group; and Jimmy Brock, CEO of Core Natural Resources Inc., is vice-chair. US coal consumption has declined for years as utilities increasingly shift toward cheaper natural gas and renewables. Coal once accounted for more than half of the country’s electricity generation, but that share fell to about 17% in 2025 and is expected to slip to 15% this year. A boom in US electricity demand, however, has provided a near-term tailwind for coal producers. Utilities have delayed retirement of coal-fired power plants, while federal orders keep others running, supporting demand and contributing to a modest rebound in 2025. Electric generation from coal climbed 13% last year, driven largely by higher gas prices. The downward trajectory is expected to resume in 2026, according to government forecasts. During Thursday’s meeting, coal and utility executives warned about overdependence on natural gas as a US power source. Some urged doing more to protect America’s mines, others emphasized the need to keep rising electricity prices in check. Wright linked coal power to a thriving manufacturing sector, and Burgum said it’s intertwined with US efforts to win the artificial intelligence competition with China — both Trump administration goals. The immediate focus now is ensuring there’s enough electricity, especially for the data centers that are key to developing AI capabilities, said Randall Atkins, CEO of coal supplier Ramaco Resources Inc. and a member of the council who attended the meeting Thursday. “The objective is the data centers, and how we’re going to figure out how to power them,” Atkins said in an interview. Separately, Wright warned that if courts compel some of the world’s largest asset managers to divest coal-related assets, it could undermine efforts to buttress coal mining and electricity generation. That’s the potential outcome of a lawsuit alleging that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. colluded to reduce coal output. Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say the firms violated antitrust laws by using environmental, social and governance-related initiatives, including carbon-reduction alliances, to suppress production.

But former Trump Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry has predicted that if successful, the lawsuit would take an estimated $18 billion in coal holdings off the asset managers’ books. He said that outcome would pose “a direct threat to coal companies’ ability to raise capital, finance infrastructure and support jobs.” Photo: The PacifiCorp Hunter coal-fired electrical generation plant in Castle Dale, Utah.

January 16, 2026 11:18 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider Market Intelligence Brief – The 2026 economy has hit the wall of physical limits. After a decade of rewarding "potential," the market has pivoted to demanding proof. Speculation is dying; tangible assets are repricing. The market has run out of patience for 'maybe.' Investors are trading speculative PowerPoint slides for real-world assets you can touch, mine, and measure. They are allocating to the Choke Points, wading through the physical and digital bottlenecks that control modern civilization. From the silver in your smartphone to the energy powering the AI grid, the era of 'cheap and easy' is over, signaling that the race for physical essentials has begun. The companies profiled below share one trait: They own the inventory. They are the load-bearing walls of the 2026 economy. This isn't a rotation. It is a scramble for the essentials. THE DIAGNOSTIC HUB Ventripoint Diagnostics (TSXV: VPT) (OTCQB: VPTDF) is erasing the geographic blind spot in cardiac care through its landmark partnership with the Nisg̱a'a Valley Health Authority to deploy AI-driven 3D heart mapping. In 2026, the most acute bottleneck in healthcare is visibility. For many, a heart diagnosis requires a long-distance flight or a months-long wait… That's the type of delay that can turn a treatable condition into a tragedy. Ventripoint is essentially putting the power of a multi-million dollar MRI room into a portable ultrasound. It’s a tech bridge that brings world-class heart diagnostics to rural communities that have been waiting years for a "clear picture". This is not a pilot project; it is a blueprint for sovereign healthcare infrastructure. By bringing hospital-grade diagnostics to the point of care, Ventripoint is proving that you don't need to move the patient to see the problem. The equipment is already in the clinic; Ventripoint provides the AI 'brain' that turns a standard ultrasound into a life-saving diagnostic tool.

While the macro argument for gold has been won, the execution argument is just beginning. Lake Victoria Gold isn't just looking for gold; they’re building the 'factory' to extract it. They are setting up shop right next door to one of the most productive gold mines (Barrick's) on the planet, turning historical data into a modern production engine. Recent drilling didn't just find gold; it proved the deposit goes far deeper than anyone expected, potentially rewriting the scale of the entire project. This is the Scarcity Doctrine in action: LVG is not just hunting for a discovery; it is manufacturing a mine. By combining a near-term production profile with the bonanza-grade discovery leverage at Tembo, the company is securing its position as a major gold factory in one of the world's most productive belts.

It's about owning the daily ritual of the modern professional. People are ditching sugar-heavy drinks and the stigma of vaping for a discreet, focused boost that fits right in their pocket. On January 12, the company accelerated this roadmap by engaging McKinney Regulatory Science Advisors to navigate the complex scientific and regulatory path for its oral pouch pipeline. This is a high-execution pivot. In late 2024, Doseology secured a critical manufacturing agreement via its U.S. subsidiary, positioning the company for commercial production of caffeine, nicotine, and functional ingredient pouches. The strategic importance of this move is underscored by the involvement of retail legend Joseph Mimran, who joined as a Strategic Advisor following the acquisition of Feed That Brain™. Mimran's expertise in building category-defining brands like Joe Fresh is being applied to Doseology's mission: providing a clean, functional alternative to energy drinks and tobacco. By owning the delivery method, Doseology is aiming to become the 'daily ritual' for a generation that demands performance without the crash.

(TSXV: AMCO) (OTCQB: AMCOF) is moving aggressively to unlock the next major silver district in Nevada, having just commenced its 2026 field program at the Trinity Silver Project in Pershing County. On January 12, the company deployed advanced drone-borne magnetometry to map a system interpreted to be structurally similar to the world-class silver deposits of Bolivia. They aren't guessing where the silver is; they are using advanced tech to restart a district with a proven history of multi-million-ounce production. The data is already surfacing. Recent grab samples on newly consolidated ground have returned bonanza grades of up to 1,690 g/t silver and 4.33 g/t gold. Think of silver as the 'digital glue' of 2026. Without it, the AI revolution stops. Americore is hunting for this essential tech-metal in Nevada, one of the safest and most proven mining jurisdictions on the map. Americore is ground-truthing a historical giant in the safest mining jurisdiction on Earth. Holding high-grade silver inventory in a Tier-1 jurisdiction like Nevada is the ultimate strategic play.

Title: The Venezuela Technocracy Connection
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-venezuela-technocracy-connection/
Time Published: 2026-01-16T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In the early morning hours of January 3, 2026, the United States military launched military strikes on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores have since been transported to the New York City to face charges relating to gun crimes and cocaine trafficking. The move has divided the MAGA base—and the American public more generally—with a large portion of President Donald Trump’s base viewing it as a betrayal of the principles he claimed to champion. Specifically, Trump has claimed for years he would not start new wars of aggression. While Trump has stated that taking out Maduro is not about launching new wars but instead a calculated attack to take out a man he blames for America’s fentanyl crisis, the facts tell another story. In May 2025, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) released its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). This report mentions Venezuela trafficking fentanyl to the US a total of zero times. Instead, it blames Mexican cartels for the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl. This should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention, as these facts are common knowledge among the US government and drug-trafficking researchers. A second key point is that although Trump and neocon Secretary of State Marco Rubio have repeatedly sought to tie Maduro to drug cartels, there remains scant evidence for the claim. The US government previously claimed Maduro was the head of the drug-trafficking group Cartel de los Soles (also known as the Cartel of the Suns). However, many skeptics have claimed the group doesn’t actually exist. During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted as the alleged leader of this cartel. In 2025, during his second term, Cartel de los Soles was officially designated a foreign terrorist organization. However, when Maduro was brought to NYC and officially charged, the US Department of Justice dropped the allegations from their indictment. The lack of charges relating to Cartel de los Soles is a signal that the US government does not believe it has strong enough evidence to convict Maduro in court. Instead, they have changed their tune and are now claiming Maduro was involved in cocaine trafficking. Hours after the raid and capture of Maduro, Trump held a press conference in which he made it perfectly clear that, despite official claims of targeting drug traffickers, the US government’s interest lies in gaining control over Venezuela’s oil industry. Make No Mistake – Venezuela is About Oil and Empire During a Saturday morning press conference, US President Donald Trump made it perfectly clear that despite claims of going after drug traffickers, the US government is interested in taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. pic.twitter.com/AJiyrh83j9 “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump stated. In 2007, Venezuela nationalized oil projects, seizing assets from companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after they refused to accept terms that would give the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) majority control. In contrast, companies like Total, Chevron, Statoil (now Equinor), and BP agreed to the restructuring and retained minority stakes in their Venezuelan projects. Trump has claimed that these actions were a theft of American oil and that part of the US presence in Venezuela will be to take this oil. “In addition, Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars. This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country. Considered the largest theft of property in the history of our country,” Trump said at the Saturday morning press conference. When pressed by journalists about his comments regarding the US “running” Venezuela, Trump responded by claiming that the oil companies would cover the costs of improvements to Venezuelan oil infrastructure. “Well, we’re gonna be running it with a group and we’re gonna make sure it’s run properly. We’re gonna rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars. It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly.” However, Trump also appeared to suggest that US taxpayers would subsidize oil companies to rebuild the infrastructure. “They will be reimbursed for what they’re doing, but, that’s gonna be paid. And we’re gonna get the oil flowing the way it should be,” Trump claimed. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump made a similar statement. “I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,” he said. “A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.” With Trump admitting that a major motivation for taking out Maduro was to benefit oil companies, it’s important to ask which companies are involved and who holds shares in them. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were involved in Venezuela’s oil sector before the nationalization under Hugo Chávez and during the subsequent US sanctions era. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the majority institutional shareholders of all three companies, typically controlling around 20-25% of the shares in each (with Vanguard and BlackRock often holding the largest stakes among institutions). Larry Fink is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of BlackRock. He’s also the current Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum. Fink also maintains a close relationship with Donald Trump, having known him for over 40 years due to both men having been involved in the Manhattan financial scene. In fact, in March 2025 it was announced that Larry Fink had consulted with Trump before he secured the purchase of two ports in the Panama Canal for BlackRock. Given Trump’s close relationship with Larry Fink, combined with BlackRock’s significant investments in major U.S. oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, these are more than likely influencing factors in the U.S. policy toward Venezuela’s oil sector. Fink is not the only billionaire benefiting handsomely from the capture of Maduro and the US occupation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Among the billionaires celebrating the US aggression is Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager whose firm, Elliot Investment Management, has long sought to acquire CITGO Petroleum, the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. In November 2025, a U.S. judge approved a $5.9 billion bid by an Elliott affiliate (Amber Energy) to purchase shares in CITGO’s parent company (PDV Holding) through a court-organized auction aimed at satisfying creditors’ claims against Venezuela. The sale still requires final approval from the U.S. Treasury Department and other regulators. CITGO’s assets include three major oil refineries (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), pipelines, terminals, and more than 4,000 CITGO-branded gas stations across the United States. With Trump relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil following the removal of Maduro, Singer stands to benefit to the tune of billions if the CITGO sale is eventually approved. Coincidentally, Singer was a major donor to Trump’s presidential campaigns, as well as to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). US Representative Thomas Massie has also claimed that Singer has already spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat him in his upcoming reelection bid. According to Grok, Paul Singer, globalist Republican mega-donor who’s already spent $1,000,000 to defeat me in the next election, stands to make billions of dollars on his distressed CITGO investment, now that this administration has taken over Venezuela.https://t.co/hq1STlEyAq It’s quite obvious that oil is one of the major drivers behind the US kidnapping of Maduro, but drugs and oil alone do not fully explain why Trump is desperate to have control over this region. In the early 20th century, a movement emerged around a political theory known as Technocracy—a system in which government and society would be managed by technical experts, often involving technology-focused solutions. Early proponents claimed that Technocracy would lead to better management of resources and the protection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, as well as centralization of power and the management of all human behavior. One of the most influential proponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer and engineer who founded the Technical Alliance in New York City in 1919. Scott believed that business owners lacked the necessary skills and data to reform their industries, and thus control should be handed over to engineers and scientists. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch established the “Committee on Technocracy” at Columbia University. The group would eventually splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated, while technocrat Harold Loeb headed the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication that outlined its vision for a Technocracy and their plan for merging North America and parts of central America into a single continental unit which they called a “Technate”: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit. [emphasis added] A 1940 map from Technocracy Inc. clearly shows this vision included Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries—including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and others. The fact that Panama was envisioned as part of the Technate should not be forgotten in light of Larry Fink’s efforts to purchase ports in the Panama Canal. The Technocrats also imagined controlling parts of Venezuela and even Colombia. The 1940 map shows portions of northern Venezuela and eastern Colombia absorbed by the Technate. Colombia’s place in the proposed Technate adds important context to Trump’s recent threats of military action in the nation. The Technocrats were not only focused on incorporating Central and South American nations into the Technate. They aimed to spread their techno-tyranny as far north as Greenland. In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

January 15, 2026 12:23 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global carbon credit market was valued at US$ 1,142.40 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 4,983.7 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 18% during the forecast period 2025–2035. The carbon credit market is on the cusp of unprecedented growth, largely propelled by robust corporate demand. In 2023 alone, companies retired an impressive 161 million carbon credits, reflecting a strong and sustained commitment to climate action. This momentum is further bolstered by over 5,200 firms that have adopted Science Based Targets (SBTs), aligning their emissions reduction strategies with the latest climate science. These companies represent a diverse cross-section of industries, all actively driving demand for carbon credits as part of their sustainability commitments, making corporate action a primary engine behind the market’s rapid expansion. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/carbon-credit-market This surge in demand is creating a distinct bifurcation within the carbon credit market, separating credits by type, quality, and price. On one end of the spectrum, low-cost renewable energy credits are trading at modest prices, often as low as $1 to $2 per ton. These credits represent emissions reductions from renewable power projects and serve as accessible entry points for companies with basic offsetting needs. On the other end, premium nature-based credits—originating from projects like forest conservation and reforestation—command prices exceeding $12 per ton. These projects offer additional environmental and social co-benefits, contributing to their higher valuation. Elevating Carbon Credits: From Offsets to Financial Assets The carbon credit market is evolving far beyond its original role as a straightforward mechanism for offsetting emissions. Today, it is rapidly transforming into a sophisticated financial ecosystem where carbon credits are recognized as valuable financial assets. This formalization marks a pivotal trend that is reshaping the market’s growth trajectory. A cornerstone of this financial evolution is the emergence of exchange-traded futures contracts for carbon credits. Platforms such as CME’s N-GEO futures have introduced standardized contracts that allow investors to buy and sell carbon credits on regulated exchanges. These futures contracts provide a level of price discovery, risk management, and market transparency that was previously elusive in the carbon market. In parallel with futures trading, the launch of over 15 specialized carbon investment funds in 2023 signals a growing institutional appetite for carbon assets. These funds pool capital from institutional investors eager to gain exposure to the carbon market’s growth potential while supporting climate action. By offering professionally managed portfolios focused exclusively on carbon credits and related projects, these funds provide an efficient entry point into this emerging asset class. Investment Flows and Compliance Markets Strengthen Supply Foundations: Global Carbon Credit Supply The global carbon credit supply landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, fueled by targeted investment and the emergence of expansive compliance frameworks. Over the past decade, capital has increasingly gravitated towards regions that combine robust regulatory environments with abundant nature-based carbon sequestration potential. Between 2013 and 2023, nearly $42 billion was funneled into the development of carbon projects worldwide, underscoring the mounting financial commitment to climate solutions. The momentum in investment shows no signs of slowing. In fact, 2024 is poised to become a record-breaking year for carbon credit fundraising, with $14 billion already committed or raised by the third quarter alone. This surge reflects heightened investor confidence and expanding interest among institutional players, corporations, and governments eager to participate in the carbon market. Large-scale compliance markets are playing a pivotal role in reshaping the supply side of the carbon credit ecosystem. These regulatory frameworks establish mandatory emission reduction targets and create strong demand for verified carbon offsets, thereby incentivizing the development of high-quality projects. Regions with established compliance systems attract disproportionate investment and project activity, as market participants seek the certainty and legitimacy these frameworks provide. Tech-Based Carbon Credits: Rising to Market Prominence Technology-based carbon credits have rapidly ascended to a dominant position in the carbon credit market, capturing an impressive 46.9% share. This surge reflects a growing preference among buyers for solutions that provide permanent, reliable, and verifiable carbon removal. As climate goals become more ambitious and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, the demand for carbon credits backed by cutting-edge technologies has skyrocketed. A key driver behind the popularity of tech-based carbon credits is their ability to deliver permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Unlike nature-based solutions, which are susceptible to risks such as forest fires, disease, or land-use changes that can release stored carbon back into the environment, technologies like Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) provide a more secure and lasting solution. Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies stand at the forefront of the tech-based carbon credit market. DAC systems actively extract CO2 directly from ambient air, concentrating it for storage or utilization, while CCS captures emissions at their source and safely stores them underground. Both methods offer scalability and measurable results, making them attractive solutions as industries strive to offset hard-to-abate emissions. Carbon Removal Projects: The New Market Vanguard Carbon removal projects have surged to dominate the market, commanding a remarkable 75.3% share that reflects a profound shift in global climate strategy. The focus has evolved from merely preventing future emissions to actively extracting existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This pivot underscores the urgency of addressing legacy carbon, which accumulates from decades of industrial activity. A significant portion of carbon removal projects leverages nature-based solutions, which utilize natural processes to capture and store carbon. A striking example from 2024 is an Amazon rainforest reforestation initiative that planted 10 million trees, with a projected CO2 removal potential of 2 million tonnes. These projects not only sequester carbon but also provide co-benefits such as biodiversity preservation, enhanced ecosystem resilience, and improved local livelihoods. Alongside nature-based efforts, technological carbon removal solutions are rapidly advancing, contributing to the market’s dominant share. These include direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and mineralization techniques designed to extract and securely store CO2. Technological removals offer the advantage of scalability and permanence, often complementing nature-based projects. Europe’s Commanding Lead in the Carbon Credit Market Europe firmly holds a dominant position in the global carbon credit market, commanding over 51.10% of the market share. This leadership is rooted in the region’s well-established and mature compliance frameworks, which provide a robust regulatory foundation that drives both mandatory and voluntary carbon offsetting activities. Europe’s pioneering approach to carbon management has set a global benchmark, particularly through its emphasis on high-permanence carbon removals that ensure long-term environmental impact. At the heart of Europe’s carbon credit market strength is the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which remains the world’s largest and most advanced carbon pricing mechanism. In 2024, allowances within the ETS consistently traded above €70 per tonne of CO2, reflecting the region’s intense regulatory pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This high carbon price creates a compelling financial incentive for industries to lower their emissions and invest in offset projects, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The stringent regulatory environment in Europe also fuels vibrant activity in the voluntary carbon credit market. In the past year alone, European companies retired over 52 million carbon credits, demonstrating a strong corporate commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainability goals. Leading energy giants such as Shell and Eni have spearheaded this movement, establishing significant offtake agreements that drive demand for high-quality carbon credits.
