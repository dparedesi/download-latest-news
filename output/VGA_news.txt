Private equity firms, struggling to find buyers for their investments, are turning to an old playbook like never before. Financial sponsors are extracting cash from their portfolio companies by raising debt to fund payouts to themselves and their investors at an unprecedented clip. Such dividend loans have hit $28.7 billion so far this year, putting them on track to surpass 2021’s record $28.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their efforts come as the private equity machine hits snarls at nearly every turn: Attractive takeover targets are sparse and it’s harder to cash out old investments and deliver the returns once promised to pension managers, foundations and wealthy individuals. To quell impatient investors, buyout shops are increasingly layering extra borrowing on their companies and funneling the proceeds of debt sales to their stakeholders instead. “All the stars are aligned for dividend recaps; rates are coming down, spreads are tight, the market is open — yet the IPO market and M&A are still subdued,” Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, said. “Investors want distributions, and dividend recaps can buy PE firms more time to wait for a better environment for exits.” Private equity firms have routinely used dividend recapitalizations to book profits and take skin out of the game after they acquire companies. Such deals can be seen as controversial and aggressive, often leading debt investors — fearing the strain of the additional debt — to push back. But with demand for loans likely outpacing supply of new debt this year, borrowers have an upper hand. This month, private equity firm Thoma Bravo priced a $750 million loan for cybersecurity firm Darktrace to fund a distribution to shareholders, in what Fitch Ratings called “an aggressive financial policy with high leverage.” In October, Thoma Bravo raised debt on Ping Identity Holding Corp. to help fund a roughly $1 billion payout. Earlier this year, another one of its portfolio companies, Proofpoint Inc., obtained a $1.35 billion loan to fund a payment to the buyout firm and employees. Other recent deals included a $1.35 billion leveraged loan by yogurt maker Chobani Inc. to partly finance a payout. Buyout firms and their clients are relying on alternative methods to unlock cash. They’re shuffling assets out of older vehicles into what are known as continuation funds, selling stakes on the secondary market and borrowing against holdings through complex loans with high interest rates. The industry’s fund distributions have slowed so drastically that, at the current rate, it would take about nine years for customers to collect their money from the more than 12,000 companies held by US buyout funds, according to Pitchbook. That’s making limited partners reluctant to step up fresh capital, with Bain & Co. estimating in a mid-year report that there were more than 18,000 private capital funds seeking $3.3 trillion. “The reason that sponsors are doing it, and driving most of this, is realistically because they have struggled to monetize their investments,” Matthew Mish, head of public and private credit strategy at UBS Group AG, said. “The IPO market has started to thaw but is not really providing an exit. The LPs are not getting their money back.” Scarce Supply Helping fuel the dividend deals is the market’s supply-demand dynamic. Roughly $915 billion of loans have been sold in 2025, about 16% lower than the same period last year. Of that debt, some 80% has been for loan refinancings and repricings, meaning there has been relatively little new debt to buy. Another driver is collateralized loan obligations, structured credit vehicles that are the largest buyers of leveraged loans. CLOs are financed by issuing bonds. There have been more than $151 billion of the debt backed by syndicated loans sold in 2025, up about 4.7% from the same time last year, according to the Bloomberg data. “The problem is the deals aren’t performing. And so when they don’t perform, even if I want to sell mine, I’m not going to sell it to the other PE guy that knows that he has his own deals that aren’t performing and he doesn’t want mine,” Mish said. “The easiest thing to do is to do a recapitalization and sell it to a less credit discriminate investor, which is a CLO.” Click here for a podcast with Vanguard on reservations it has on junk bonds Week In Review On the Move With assistance from Dan Wilchins. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Hero Subtitle: The Heroes who brought you Internet Privacy Terminal: man cypherpunks These are the heroes that built the tools to protect us all. They showed that cryptography is a quiet declaration of freedom. The tools we rely on today came from those who refused to accept that freedom and privacy were negotiable. They built the infrastructure of independence, and in doing so, gave us a free world. Cryptography is a declaration. The people in these halls built systems that defied states. They wrote code when cryptography was treated as contraband. They stood for individual rights long before most understood that a battle was underway. They are the quiet heroes we never deserved. "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and we're going to write it." - Eric Hughes We remember them, and we thank them, for the freedoms their code made possible, and for the ones it allows us to defend. The fathers of freedom understood they were in a world ruled by law but governed by control. They knew that without privacy, freedom was theater. So they built tools no one else understood, that would become the arsenal of the free. John Gilmore ⭐ - Visionary co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), he championed digital privacy and fought government surveillance through landmark activism and litigation. Instrumental in launching the Cypherpunks mailing list, he fostered a global community dedicated to advancing cryptography and resisting censorship. Gilmore was a key supporter of the GNU Project, free software, and open encryption, and his iconic phrase, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it", encapsulates the cypherpunk ethos of resilience and decentralization. His advocacy for strong cryptography and opposition to export controls helped shape the legal and technical landscape for privacy tools. Wikipedia Perry Metzger ⭐ - Co-founder of the Cypherpunks mailing list, he catalyzed the global exchange of ideas on privacy, digital cash, and anonymous communication, directly influencing the development of remailers and practical cryptographic tools. An early advocate for strong encryption, he bridged theoretical cryptography and real-world implementation, providing technical infrastructure and thought leadership that helped shape the cypherpunk movement's pragmatic approach to digital freedom, censorship resistance, and privacy-by-design. American Scientist They took math too pure to weaponize and did it anyway, proving that ideas can defend people and laying the foundations for all cypherpunks. They refused to let banks be the gatekeepers of freedom. They turned cryptography into money and math into trust. The world called it digital currency. They called it independence. They took the promise of cryptography and made it run at scale. Code became infrastructure. Privacy became practical. Every packet encrypted became a quiet act of resistance, that just works. They knew the risks and spoke anyway. They paid in freedom to show us the truth. The Translators. They built the culture that made privacy a cause instead of a feature. The Courtroom Warriors. They battled the state on its own turf. They translated code into arguments and turned resistance into precedent. They built nations of the mind. From ideals to infrastructure, they mapped the blueprint for digital civilization itself, redefining the social contract, designing systems where citizenship, governance, and value flow across networks, not borders. The Foundation. Before cypherpunks, there were the pioneers who built the substrate of freedom itself. They designed the OS layer that made the rest possible. Everything began with them. Complex Legacies. Builders who carried the mission forward through the system and sometimes against it. Not without controversy, andn ever without consequence. This hall will never be complete. The fight for privacy doesn't end, it evolves. Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight, someone is writing code to protect people they'll never meet. Someone is proving that technology can serve freedom. if (you.value_privacy) { cypherpunk(you); } The people in this hall showed us that cryptography is freedom. They proved that a few determined keyboard warriors with conviction can become the greatest heroes of the free world. You're next. Infrastructure for freedom. Code for sovereignty. These projects are weapons bringing both freedom of speech and defense against surveillance. They're proof that decentralized systems can work. They're the infrastructure layer of digital freedom. Because when you write code that liberates people, you’re programming the future. liberation() The mathematical breakthroughs that made everything else possible. These are the protocols that turned cryptography from an academic curiosity into a tool for mass liberation. The Anonymity Layer. Privacy requires anonymity. These projects hide who you are, who you're talking to, and what you're saying. I2P (Invisible Internet Project) - Anonymous overlay network enabling censorship-resistant communication, I2P employs garlic routing to bundle multiple encrypted messages, enhancing metadata resistance beyond traditional onion routing. It powers privacy-preserving hidden services, anonymous browsing, secure email, decentralized file sharing, and peer-to-peer applications, fostering a robust ecosystem for activists, journalists, and users seeking digital freedom. By decentralizing infrastructure and resisting surveillance, it advances cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Wikipedia Mixmaster / Mixminion - Pioneered anonymous email communication by introducing the second- and third-generation anonymous remailer protocols, enabling users to send messages without revealing their identity or metadata. Mixmaster implemented fixed-size packets and layered onion encryption, thwarting traffic analysis and enhancing privacy. Mixminion advanced the design with improved reply blocks and more robust delivery, setting a technical precedent for metadata-resistant messaging and influencing later anonymity networks like Tor. These protocols embodied cypherpunk ideals by empowering individuals to communicate securely and anonymously, resisting surveillance and censorship. Wikipedia The Toolbox. Practical encryption tools that protect files, messages, and communications from surveillance. LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) - Provides the de facto standard for Linux full-disk encryption, enabling robust protection of sensitive data at rest. By introducing a secure metadata header supporting multiple key slots, LUKS allows for flexible key management and secure password changes without re-encryption. Managed via cryptsetup, it is integrated into nearly all major Linux distributions, empowering users to control their own cryptographic keys and resist unauthorized access. LUKS embodies cypherpunk values by democratizing strong encryption, making privacy and digital autonomy accessible to millions of users and organizations worldwide. Wikipedia dm-crypt - Enables robust, transparent block-level encryption within the Linux kernel, empowering users to secure entire disks or partitions against unauthorized access. As the foundational engine beneath LUKS, it supports advanced cipher modes like XTS-AES, ensuring strong cryptographic protection for sensitive data at rest. Widely adopted in privacy-centric distributions and by security professionals, it exemplifies cypherpunk principles by making strong, open source encryption accessible to all, directly countering surveillance and data theft. Its integration into mainstream operating systems has made full-disk encryption a practical default, advancing digital autonomy and resistance to coercive data disclosure. Wikipedia The Infrastructure. Without these systems, privacy tools couldn't exist. Open source operating systems that can be audited, verified, and trusted. The Building Blocks. Cryptographic libraries that developers use to build secure applications. Easy to use correctly, hard to misuse. LibreSSL - Provides a security-hardened, open source alternative to OpenSSL, created by the OpenBSD team in response to the catastrophic Heartbleed vulnerability. LibreSSL aggressively removes legacy code, modernizes cryptographic primitives, and enforces rigorous code auditing, reducing attack surface and improving reliability for privacy-critical applications. Its focus on transparency, minimalism, and open development directly advances cypherpunk goals of trustworthy, decentralized security infrastructure, powering secure communications in privacy tools, servers, and embedded systems. Wikipedia BoringSSL - Delivers a hardened, modern fork of OpenSSL designed to minimize attack surface and eliminate legacy vulnerabilities, powering secure communications in Chrome, Android, and Cloudflare. By removing outdated algorithms, tightening default security settings, and focusing on robust cryptographic primitives, it advances the cypherpunk goal of widespread, reliable encryption for billions of users. Its rigorous code review and proactive security stance set a new standard for open source cryptographic libraries, directly supporting privacy and digital freedom at global scale. Wikipedia Noise Protocol Framework - Enables the creation of secure, privacy-preserving communication protocols by defining modular cryptographic handshake patterns like Noise_NN and Noise_XX, which combine Diffie-Hellman key exchange and authenticated encryption (AEAD) for robust confidentiality and forward secrecy. Widely adopted in privacy-focused tools such as WireGuard and the Lightning Network, it empowers decentralized, censorship-resistant networks by making strong cryptography accessible and auditable, embodying cypherpunk principles of user autonomy and digital freedom. Wikipedia Modern Cypherpunk Privacy Layer. Selected for transparency, independence, and avoidance of telemetry or ad-tech ties. These VPNs represent privacy-first infrastructure. Money Without Middlemen. From theoretical concepts to working systems, these projects proved that value can be exchanged without institutions controlling the flow. DigiCash - Invented truly private digital payments by implementing blind signatures, enabling users to withdraw and spend e-cash tokens that banks could verify but not trace, thus separating identity from transaction history. DigiCash's architecture provided a practical demonstration of anonymous, cryptographically secure electronic cash, directly influencing the design of later cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and foundational privacy concepts in digital finance. Its legacy endures as a blueprint for privacy-preserving money and a milestone in the cypherpunk quest for digital freedom. Wikipedia b-money - Pioneered the concept of decentralized digital currency by outlining a system for electronic cash using a public, distributed ledger, proof-of-work mining, and cryptographically enforced contracts in b-money. Introduced mechanisms for digital scarcity, anonymous transactions, and consensus without trusted intermediaries, directly inspiring the design of Bitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies. Cited by Satoshi Nakamoto as foundational, it advanced cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship by envisioning money as a protocol, not an institution. Wikipedia bit gold - Established a decentralized digital currency concept by chaining proof-of-work puzzles with timestamped public registries, enabling trustless, verifiable ownership of digital assets without intermediaries. bit gold directly inspired the architecture of Bitcoin, introducing core ideas like distributed consensus, scarcity enforced by computation, and resistance to censorship. Its design anticipated blockchain's role in privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer value transfer, making it a foundational milestone in cypherpunk efforts to undermine centralized control over money and empower individual autonomy. Wikipedia Hashcash - Introduced the concept of proof-of-work to combat email spam by requiring senders to compute a SHA-based hash collision, thereby imposing a computational cost on bulk messaging and deterring abuse. Its elegant challenge - response mechanism became foundational for decentralized trustless systems, directly inspiring the mining process and consensus protocol of Bitcoin and influencing later privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. By demonstrating how cryptographic puzzles could enable resistance to censorship and Sybil attacks without central authorities, it advanced core cypherpunk ideals of autonomy, privacy, and digital freedom. Hashcash's legacy endures in modern anti-spam tools, blockchain security, and the architecture of decentralized digital cash. Wikipedia Breaking the Cloud Monopoly. Distributed systems that don't rely on centralized servers or corporate infrastructure. The Security Stack. The protocols and systems that make secure communication possible at Internet scale. DNSCrypt - Secures the typically unencrypted DNS lookup process by authenticating and encrypting queries between users and resolvers, thwarting interception, censorship, and surveillance by ISPs or adversaries. Utilizes modern cryptography, notably X25519 for key exchange, to ensure forward secrecy and integrity. By pioneering practical deployment of encrypted DNS before widespread adoption of DNS-over-HTTPS, it empowered individuals to reclaim privacy at a fundamental layer of internet communication, embodying cypherpunk principles of decentralization and resistance to surveillance. Wikipedia OTR (Off-the-Record Messaging) - Cryptographic protocol pioneering both perfect forward secrecy and deniability in real-time chat, it ensures that messages are encrypted and authenticated during transmission but cannot be proven to originate from a specific user after the conversation ends. By introducing these properties to instant messaging, it set a new standard for secure communications, directly influencing the design of modern protocols like Signal and inspiring broader adoption of ephemeral, privacy-preserving messaging. Its open source reference implementation and protocol specification have empowered activists, journalists, and privacy advocates worldwide to communicate securely, embodying cypherpunk ideals of decentralization and user autonomy. Wikipedia The Movement Infrastructure. Organizations and projects that defend digital rights, spread knowledge, and fight for freedom. The Origin Story. Before the term "cypherpunk" existed, these projects and manifestos laid the cultural and technical foundations. Every day, millions of people rely on these systems to communicate securely, transact privately, and resist surveillance. The next breakthrough is being built right now. Someone is writing the protocol that will obsolete everything on this list. Someone is deploying infrastructure that will protect the next generation. while (surveillance.exists()) { cypherpunks.code(); } Ship freedom. Lessons from the Fallen Not every privacy project stays true to its mission. Some were compromised. Some mysteriously shut down. Some made choices that betrayed their users' trust. This section documents projects that failed, were compromised, or can no longer be trusted. The graveyard of privacy tools teaches us as much as the Hall of Fame. "Don't trust. Verify." - Every cypherpunk who learned the hard way These services chose death over betrayal by choosing to shut down rather than backdoor their users. They deserve respect. These services were compromised, backdoored, blacklisted or taken over by law enforcement. They cannot be trusted. These services made architectural choices or policy decisions that fundamentally compromise user privacy. Privacy tools that were acquired by companies with different incentives. Every compromised project teaches us something: The only trusted system is one you can audit yourself, running on hardware you control or can remote attest and verify, using open protocols that can't be backdoored. Build systems that can't betray their users, even if the developers want to. Built with significant effort, in respect for those who put significantly more effort into the tools we use to stay free.
