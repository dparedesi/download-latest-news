BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said.

The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Title: Wall Street Banks Cleared by Texas AG After Leaving NZBA

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

January 07, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Veterans Recovery Network Inc. Veterans Recovery Network Inc. PHOENIX, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An African American man on the ASD spectrum working at Veterans Recovery Network, a veteran services organization for homeless military veterans, has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Nevada District against The Siegel Select Group, a national property management firm previously investigated by members of Congress for unlawful evictions, and city law enforcement officials at the Casa Grande Police Department for allegedly running unlawful evictions, recklessly interfering with active protection orders issued by an Arizona judge, wanton eviction procedures, and submitting falsified police report information about a physical assault on a Casa Grande woman last February while he was nearly 700 miles away, as court documents infer to evince the cumulative effects involved in this situation. Cary Peterson, who works at a non-governmental organization that supports disabled and homeless military veterans, filed a civil lawsuit against the Siegel Select Group, and local police officers for unlawful eviction and civil rights violation claims. The lawsuit alleges that Siegel Group's management in Arizona interfered with a court order of protection, locked Peterson out of his unit, violated statutory laws on due process rights to tenants, and had been involved in a monetary dispute over a holiday rental property funded by Veterans Recovery Network. Arizona Senator T.J. Shope, a member of the 16th Legislature District, expressed disinterest in the 'undesired lobbying contact' email concerning this legal situation in his backyard involving ASD-disabled Black-Hispanic man and his son who were initially visited with threats of physical harm and racial harassment with death threats prior to filing a lawsuit for a order of restraint, according to Mesa Police Department records and the criminal prosecution that remains pending in the court, and a matter of the public interest at the Arizona Attorney General’s office. Shope, a member of the Arizona legislative committee on public safety, is a member of the 16th Legislature District, which includes Casa Grande and Pinal County. OLD BEEFS In the Summer of 2024, the Veterans Recovery Network had been working with a disabled military veteran in Mesa with his VA benefits. PACT Act Relief Settlement Program advocated administrative complaints filed with the Office of Civil Rights and the Arizona Attorney General when they became aware of the landlord-clients of Hull, Holiday & Holiday Law Office for evictions against members of their veterans organization. These eviction actions all resulted from disabled tenants living on SSDI or VA disability benefits being placed into an housing-assistance programs run by state-mandated nonprofit organizations that were required to pay the majority or all of the disabled tenants’ rent payments. But eviction actions started instead after these community-bridging organizations failed to do so after several months (without the tenant's knowledge). NEW BEEFS December 18, 2024, Siegel Select Group filed a crossover lawsuit against Peterson in the Casa Grande Justice concerning the Arizona rental property controversies raised in Peterson federal lawsuit filed against Siegel’s corporate office and property manager two weeks earlier. Peterson’s federal complaint against Siegel Select Group Nevada, Siegel's Arizona property manager Rebecca Blanford and an unidentified male with her, and police officials in the City of Casa Grande, was followed by Casa Grande Justice Court Justice of Peace John Ellsworth, a military veteran who’s judiciary profile (https://www.pinalcourtsaz.gov/directory.aspx?eid=32) quote reads that ‘all persons should be held accountable for their actions,’ entered a court hearing disposition (an eviction judgment in favor of Siegel) that the respondent, Cary Peterson- ironically being a (retired) Tribal court judge from Silicon Valley- 'failed to appear' in court on December 23, 2024, resulting in a default judgment against him. This 'absentia' judgment erroneously entered by the court occurred despite Peterson typing his name into the Zoom conference of the court hearing, stating that he was 'present' before the court sessions began, which included communication on the official court record with Siegel's attorney and Judge Ellsworth. The court record shows that Peterson filed an appeal with an application order receipt for a 'supersedeas bond' in accordance with the Arizona law before the Pinal County Constable got involved to reclaim the rental property in dispute last week. The same Arizona justice court that stated Peterson 'failed to appear' for the eviction hearing [as well] denied Peterson’s notice of appeal, and supplemental motions requesting the court transcript and ‘designation of record on appeal.’ CONGRESSIONAL FAULT-FINDING In 2021, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn was the vanguard of a congressional committee report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) against Siegel Select Group. In July 2022, Congressman Clyburn published a report that condemned the Siegel Group for unlawful evictions and civil rights violations of several tenants during the pinnacle of the COVID crisis, their 'misleading' and 'aggressive' tactics to evict tenants "uniquely egregious." According to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, chaired by Rep. James E. Clyburn, this federal legislative report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) revealed that Siegel Select Group used abusive tactics to 'evict tens of thousands of struggling residents' despite the current eviction laws during the COVID pandemic, while receiving $2 million in forgiven Paycheck Protection Program funds (PPP government loans). EVIDENT ERRORS The (erroneously-issued) 'failure to appear' judicial order is [now] a multi-jurisdictional controversy that now remains a matter of the United States District Court (Peterson v. Siegel Group Nevada Inc., et al., No. Case No. 2:24-cv-02265 (D. Nev. Dec. 6, 2024) derived from more than a handful of related lawsuits between Peterson, a veteran client of Veteran Recovery Recovery Network ('Sternberg'), the Siegel Group, particular Siegel Select Group employees ('Blanford'), Casa Grande City's police officer Timothy Dunham, three unidentified Casa Grande police officials, and the Law Offices of Hull, Holiday & Holiday- a complex legal matter which public records show had a domino-effect of cumulative errors after a simple misinterpretation caused by what Peterson says was a 'crank call' made to the police by an estranged relative in Arizona last February, while Peterson was several hundreds of miles away in California. The erroneous police reporting by the Casa Grande Police Department was followed by irregularities in the Arizona justice system that resulted in the Arizona state court’s communications director telling the Arizona State Bar’s communications director and a news investigator in an email response that he could not find any trace of newly-appointed Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Lisa Boddington’s family court docket cases involving Peterson as a party. Last September, in another instance related to Commissioner Boddington’s judicial case load, the judge’s deputy clerk concedes to the court transcriber that the audio recordings from [all three] court hearings related to Peterson’s protection order actions were lost due to ‘human error.’ Court papers disclose that Peterson believes that the erroneous police report information filed by the Casa Grande Police caused the Arizona judges and local community to place him in a bad light, defaming his character and reputation in general. STATUS OF PROCEEDINGS Last Friday, Peterson filed an emergency motion to transfer this case matter to the United States District Court for the Arizona District due to the fact that Nevada does not have jurisdiction to hear civil rights claims against local law enforcement officials under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States of Code. These court proceedings, assigned to United States District Court Chief Judge Andrew P. Gordon of the Nevada District, remain pending. There are no scheduled hearings at the present time. ﻿News Content By: David De Livera, Alena Moskowitz-Hardley (freelance writers) A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/38cf3fd6-0a61-4eb3-9d4d-ad4595978120

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Taylor Wimpey.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Taylor Wimpey. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Taylor Wimpey's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Taylor Wimpey is not owned by hedge funds.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Taylor Wimpey plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£3.5m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.
