November 25, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Jiayin Group Inc. Jiayin Group Inc. SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jiayin Group Inc. (“Jiayin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JFIN), a leading fintech platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights: _______________________1 “Loan facilitation volume” refers to the loan facilitation volume facilitated in Chinese Mainland during the period presented.2 “Repeat borrower contribution” for a given period refers to the percentage of loan facilitation volume in Chinese Mainland attributable to repeat borrowers during that period.“Repeat borrowers” during a certain period refers to borrowers who have borrowed in such period and have borrowed at least twice since such borrowers’ registration on our platform until the end of such period.3 “90 day+ delinquency ratio” refers to the outstanding principal balance of loans that were 91 to 180 calendar days past due as a percentage of the total outstanding principal balance of loans facilitated through the Company’s platform as of a specific date. Loans facilitated outside Chinese Mainland are not included in the calculation.4 Please see the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release. Mr. Yan Dinggui, the Company’s Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In the third quarter, we anchored our strategic focus on fortifying operational resilience and advancing prudent risk management. Despite the uncertainty in the macro environment, we reached our previously stated guidance of RMB32.2 billion in loan facilitation volume and RMB490.6 million in Non-GAAP income from operation. We have actively engaged with our financial institution partners to adapt to regulatory changes, while advancing our AI technologies and refining operational work flows, collectively elevating the quality and efficiency of our facilitation services. These efforts lay a robust foundation for sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to further consolidating our competitive edge in core domains, ensuring the Company stays at the vanguard of fintech innovation while delivering enduring, stakeholder-centric value.” Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net revenue was RMB1,470.2 million (US$206.5 million), representing an increase of 1.8% from the same period of 2024. Revenue from loan facilitation services was RMB1,220.7 million (US$171.5 million), representing an increase of 10.4% from the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher loan facilitation volume, partially offset by service fee adjustments. Revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities was RMB151.8 million (US$21.3 million) compared with RMB251.7 million in the same period of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average outstanding loan balances for which the Company provided guarantee services. Other revenue was RMB97.7 million (US$13.7 million), compared with RMB87.5 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the contribution from referral fees. Facilitation and servicing expense was RMB286.5 million (US$40.2 million) compared with RMB419.1 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to decreased expenses related to financial guarantee services. Allowance for uncollectible receivables, contract assets, loans receivable and others was RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million), representing a decrease of 87.1% from the same period of 2024, primarily due to decreased allowance for oversea loans as a result of disposal of Nigeria entities during 2024 and growth slowdown of receivables from loan facilitation business. Sales and marketing expense was RMB544.2 million (US$76.4 million), representing a decrease of 1.1% from the same period of 2024. General and administrative expense was RMB72.4 million (US$10.2 million), representing an increase of 29.0% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in share-based compensation. Research and development expense was RMB108.7 million (US$15.3 million), representing an increase of 13.3% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits. Income from operation was RMB456.9 million (US$64.2 million), representing an increase of 46.5% from the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP income from operation was RMB490.6 million (US$68.9 million), compared with RMB326.5 million in the same period of 2024. Net income was RMB376.5 million (US$52.9 million), representing an increase of 39.7% from the same period of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per share were both RMB1.83 (US$0.26) compared with RMB1.27 in the third quarter of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were both RMB7.32 (US$1.04) compared with RMB5.08 in the third quarter of 2024. Each ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares of the Company. Cash and cash equivalents were RMB124.2 million (US$17.4 million) as of September 30, 2025, compared with RMB316.2 million as of June 30, 2025. The following chart and table display the historical cumulative M3+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage for loan products facilitated through the Company’s platform in Chinese Mainland. Business Outlook The Company expects its loan facilitation volume for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of RMB127.8 billion to RMB129.8 billion and its loan facilitation volume for the fourth quarter of 2025 to be in the range of RMB23.0 billion to RMB25.0 billion. The Company expects its non-GAAP income from operation for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of RMB1.99 billion to RMB2.06 billion.

We believe that non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP income from operation represents income from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses. Such adjustment has no impact on income tax. Non-GAAP income from operation is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for income from operation, net income, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. November 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Big Law made one fortune helping private equity lure large investors. Now it’s minting another helping the industry attract small ones. Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions — and often bill more than $1,000 an hour for their services — are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. The lawyers’ lucrative, if unglamorous, task: setting up funds that promise to bring private equity’s rarefied style of investing to everyday people, even as some big institutions pull back from these investments. For the financial-industrial complex — bankers, asset managers, lawyers, financial advisors, record-keepers — the incentive is obvious. All told, nearly $13 trillion is sitting in 401(k) accounts and other defined-contribution retirement plans. Tapping into that trove could help plug gaps left by deep-pocketed pensions and endowments. “More and more people are realizing there’s a lot of money in this,” said Phil Troyer, of counsel at Endeavor Law in Overland Park, Kansas, who specializes in compliance in the retirement-plan industry. Financial advisors say average investors should tread carefully when weighing whether to add private assets to their retirement mix. There’s no guarantee future investment returns will justify the industry’s high fees. Related:DOL Drops Legal Defense of Biden Fiduciary Rule Lawyers, however, can bill today. Legal fees for the structuring and paperwork of a simple private-markets fund for retail investors can sometimes be as much as $1.5 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Ongoing legal work can amount to hundreds of thousands a year. Wall Street lawyers say they’ve never seen anything quite like this. Fund specialists — who once set up far less lucrative mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and were snubbed by some of the big firms — are now so coveted that pay can stretch into seven digits, people close to the firms say. Ho-hum legal work like going through fund regulations and preparing prospectuses suddenly looks like a growth business. And so big-name law firms like Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Kirkland & Ellis are stepping up and looking for talent in an area that, until recently, was far from being a priority. They’re helping the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. set up funds aimed at retail investors. A lawyer at one prominent firm said he recently received 25 inquiries in a single week from private-markets firms looking to get into the 401(k) market. Related:J.P. Morgan Wealth Head at Center of Senator’s Epstein Inquiry Private equity players and their lawyers have been laying the groundwork for this moment for years. Since 2020, the number of semi-liquid private-market funds — which allow periodic cash redemptions — aimed at retail and private-wealth investors has doubled, to roughly 380, according to Preqin. Now, the push is accelerating after President Donald Trump gave the industry a green light to go after the 401(k) market. This year, Apollo, Ares Management Corp., Blackstone, Blue Owl Capital Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, Neuberger Berman and Partners Group all announced new funds for the masses. More are on the way. Simpson Thacher, which advised KKR on its famous 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, has done legal work on more than 50 funds since it started building a retail team in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter, including for Blackstone, Apollo, KKR and TPG Inc. The law firm advised on a new partnership between Blackstone, Vanguard Group — the great popularizer of low-cost index funds — and Vanguard’s longtime partner Wellington Management Co., and a similar tie-up with Capital Group and KKR to bring private-market funds to the masses. To handle the new business, law firms have been shelling out for legal talent. In the past decade, Simpson Thacher has expanded its team for retail funds from a handful of people to include 21 partners and 125 lawyers. Related:Florida Advisor Pleads Guilty to $94M Scheme Targeting Venezuelans Kirkland & Ellis has expanded its unit to about 60 people from fewer than five a half-decade ago and advises at least 60 clients on their retail funds, according to people familiar with the matter. Recent clients include Ares’ Strategic Income Fund and Neuberger Berman’s Private Markets Access Fund. In July it said it’s advising Blue Owl on a strategic partnership with retirement, employee benefits and investment management firm Voya Financial Inc. to develop private-markets products for defined-contribution retirement plans. Two other white-shoe law firms, Davis Polk & Wardwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, have been hiring in this area, too. Rajib Chanda, the partner who set up the Simpson Thacher’s retail practice, Kirkland & Ellis partner Erica Berthou and Cleary Gottlieb partner Jeff Karpf each said their firms are following client demand. Davis Polk didn’t respond to requests for comment. Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

Title: PE Firms Flood Junk Debt Market to Pay Themselves

Private equity firms, struggling to find buyers for their investments, are turning to an old playbook like never before. Financial sponsors are extracting cash from their portfolio companies by raising debt to fund payouts to themselves and their investors at an unprecedented clip. Such dividend loans have hit $28.7 billion so far this year, putting them on track to surpass 2021’s record $28.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their efforts come as the private equity machine hits snarls at nearly every turn: Attractive takeover targets are sparse and it’s harder to cash out old investments and deliver the returns once promised to pension managers, foundations and wealthy individuals. To quell impatient investors, buyout shops are increasingly layering extra borrowing on their companies and funneling the proceeds of debt sales to their stakeholders instead. “All the stars are aligned for dividend recaps; rates are coming down, spreads are tight, the market is open — yet the IPO market and M&A are still subdued,” Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, said. “Investors want distributions, and dividend recaps can buy PE firms more time to wait for a better environment for exits.” Private equity firms have routinely used dividend recapitalizations to book profits and take skin out of the game after they acquire companies. Such deals can be seen as controversial and aggressive, often leading debt investors — fearing the strain of the additional debt — to push back. But with demand for loans likely outpacing supply of new debt this year, borrowers have an upper hand. This month, private equity firm Thoma Bravo priced a $750 million loan for cybersecurity firm Darktrace to fund a distribution to shareholders, in what Fitch Ratings called “an aggressive financial policy with high leverage.” In October, Thoma Bravo raised debt on Ping Identity Holding Corp. to help fund a roughly $1 billion payout. Earlier this year, another one of its portfolio companies, Proofpoint Inc., obtained a $1.35 billion loan to fund a payment to the buyout firm and employees. Other recent deals included a $1.35 billion leveraged loan by yogurt maker Chobani Inc. to partly finance a payout. Buyout firms and their clients are relying on alternative methods to unlock cash. They’re shuffling assets out of older vehicles into what are known as continuation funds, selling stakes on the secondary market and borrowing against holdings through complex loans with high interest rates. The industry’s fund distributions have slowed so drastically that, at the current rate, it would take about nine years for customers to collect their money from the more than 12,000 companies held by US buyout funds, according to Pitchbook. That’s making limited partners reluctant to step up fresh capital, with Bain & Co. estimating in a mid-year report that there were more than 18,000 private capital funds seeking $3.3 trillion. “The reason that sponsors are doing it, and driving most of this, is realistically because they have struggled to monetize their investments,” Matthew Mish, head of public and private credit strategy at UBS Group AG, said. “The IPO market has started to thaw but is not really providing an exit. The LPs are not getting their money back.” Scarce Supply Helping fuel the dividend deals is the market’s supply-demand dynamic. Roughly $915 billion of loans have been sold in 2025, about 16% lower than the same period last year. Of that debt, some 80% has been for loan refinancings and repricings, meaning there has been relatively little new debt to buy. Another driver is collateralized loan obligations, structured credit vehicles that are the largest buyers of leveraged loans. CLOs are financed by issuing bonds. There have been more than $151 billion of the debt backed by syndicated loans sold in 2025, up about 4.7% from the same time last year, according to the Bloomberg data. “The problem is the deals aren’t performing. And so when they don’t perform, even if I want to sell mine, I’m not going to sell it to the other PE guy that knows that he has his own deals that aren’t performing and he doesn’t want mine,” Mish said. “The easiest thing to do is to do a recapitalization and sell it to a less credit discriminate investor, which is a CLO.” Click here for a podcast with Vanguard on reservations it has on junk bonds Week In Review On the Move With assistance from Dan Wilchins. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
