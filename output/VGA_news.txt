(Bloomberg) -- BNP Paribas SA finalized the €5.1 billion ($5.3 billion) purchase of Axa SA’s asset management unit, in the biggest acquisition under Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe.

The transaction is expected to close by the middle of next year, and have an impact of 25 basis points on BNP Paribas’ CET1 ratio, the French lender said in a statement Saturday, confirming its previous guidance. The deal will create one of Europe’s largest money managers, with roughly €1.5 trillion in assets overseen. A good chunk will be in popular and usually more lucrative markets such as private credit, infrastructure and real estate, where Axa adds more than €200 billion. Prior to the purchase, the BNP CEO had shied away from big takeovers, deciding instead to return excess cash to shareholders after selling US lender Bank of the West for $16.3 billion last year. The Axa deal will allow BNP to challenge Europe’s No. 1 in asset management, Amundi SA, although it would still be dwarfed by US firms such as BlackRock Inc. or Vanguard Group Inc. Axa has said it plans to use proceeds from the sale for share buybacks and to fund growth.

Packed with groundbreaking gear and technology, unparalleled education, and industry-defining moments, LDI 2024 proved why it remains the ultimate gathering for live entertainment and production technology. A Milestone Year for LDI 2024Bursting with cutting-edge technology, unmatched education programs, and unforgettable networking opportunities, LDI 2024 reached new heights. The event featured the largest professional training program in its history, a 50% increase in LDInstitute™ classes, more than 125 LDInnovation™ Conference sessions, and a 10% larger exhibit floor showcasing over 350 exhibitors. “LDI 2024 was a vibrant celebration of the creativity, innovation, and community that power the live entertainment industry,” said Jessi Cybulski, Show Director, LDI. “With outstanding professional training, an electric show floor, and countless opportunities to connect, this year’s event exceeded expectations. We can’t wait to see what the industry will create in the coming year and showcase at LDI 2025.” LDI 2024 Highlights: What attendees and sponsors had to say about LDI 2024: “As far as the quality of programming and the quality of showroom floor, it's definitely some of the top memories I'll have when it goes to conferences and attending events,” said Michaela Ternasky-Holland, Creator, Immersive, Spatial, & Interactive Experiences (VR, AR, AI). “It's been really, really great to come back and experience LDI and just seeing the growth that has happened in just a short amount of time, both in the size of the overall event and then also the technology. If you're thinking about coming to LDI or getting into this industry, I would certainly recommend you taking advantage of this amazing opportunity that happens every year. Just great exposure to many of the manufacturers, all of the technology that you see on any of the events that are happening out there is here at the LDI conference. Even better are the people and the relationships that make all the live events in the industry happen. It's all about the people and the products, and it all happens here at LDI,” said Shane Smith, Sr. Director Technology, LMG, Inc. “It’s the perfect opportunity to see a showcase of the latest and greatest in tech, and also network and meet with the movers and shakers who are in this exciting field. As a first-time attendee when the Expo Floor opened, I was like a kid walking into a candy store. It was just incredible. The lights, the sounds, the noises, the people, the technology. Yeah, this is a great experience,” said Brian Crane, Founder, Crane Light & Design. “This is the conference that I go to because all of my friends are here. I was a lighting person back in the day. And this is the place that I come to see all the new technology, the new equipment. And now that I'm working more on the rigging side of things, I get a chance to come and talk about that this year,” said Kristi Ross-Clausen, Director of Education and Training, TheaterHealthandSafety.com. “LDI is a wonderful thing every year where all the vendors come together and you get an opportunity to see all of the new things out there. But, also, it's really a meeting of the minds where you get all the people who are actually creating this cutting-edge technology into one space. So, it's a great place to talk to people, pick up on what's coming up as far as ideas goes and what people have in the pipeline,” said Tyler DeLong, Managing Partner, DeLong Rigging Solutions. “LDI to me is the mecca for theater technology around the planet. If you want to broaden your horizons and know more about your craft, whatever that craft is, whether it's rigging, whether it's lighting, whatever it is, you come to LDI to see the latest products, to talk to the leaders in the industry and learn more about what it is that they do that makes them successful. It's honestly just a great place to get together with the OGs in the industry to swap stories, meet new people, encourage the young ones today to get into the business and help it grow, because this business is growing exponentially every day,” said Tracy Nunnally, Owner, Vertigo. “This is my favorite show. Not only do a lot of our customers come here, you have end users and production companies from some of the leading companies. So, we've met so many incredible contacts here. Many touring companies have come to visit our booth, and we're really excited for them to use INFiLED with some of the top performers in the country. Such amazing contacts, just a real incredible place, and really just a fun place to be. So, I definitely recommend everyone to be at LDI,” said Larry Lipsie, Senior Sales Manager, INFiLED. “It's been a great show. We've had a lot of really great interactions with tons of different people. Attendance has been really good this year,” said Will Komassa, President/CEO, Blizzard Lighting LLC. “It's been a fantastic show. We've seen all kinds of people here from students who are just starting out in their careers in the entertainment technology world, all the way up to the most seasoned professionals that we've ever seen at this show,” said Ryan Hindinger, Market Manager CT&LE, ACT Entertainment.
