Tesla (TSLA) shares surged Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization back above $1 trillion, amid a broad market rally after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Shares of Tesla rose nearly 7% to close at $318.38 Monday, bringing the company's market cap to $1.02 trillion. That makes the Elon Musk-led automaker one of just nine American companies worth $1 trillion or more, along with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), and Broadcom (AVGO). Tesla's stock has climbed for three consecutive weeks, but the shares are still down more than 20% for 2025. The EV maker has faced a political backlash over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, with shares erasing much of their gains in the wake of President Donald Trump's election win. Last month, Musk said he would step back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency to spend more time with Tesla. Sales have lagged, including in China, where the company shipped fewer vehicles in April than it did a year earlier. Last month marked Tesla's seventh straight month of year-over-year declines in shipments from China, according to preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association.

Shares of tech firms surged in early trading Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily slash tariffs while they work out a long term deal. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks—Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN)—advanced along with global indexes on the de-escalation of the trade war with China. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) was up 4% shortly after the markets opened. Shares of chipmakers Marvell Technologies (MRVL), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) also rose sharply. Tech stocks had gotten hammered after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in early April prompted one of the worst stock sell-offs in decades, with Apple shares losing 16% of their value in their worst 2-day stretch since September 2008. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: The Dow surges 1,000 points and the Nasdaq soars 4% as the U.S. and China call a trade war truce

U.S. stocks soared Monday after Washington and Beijing struck a surprise deal to dramatically cut tariffs, marking a rare moment of clarity and good news in an otherwise volatile environment. The agreement, announced early Monday after weekend talks in Switzerland, includes a 90-day pause on new tariffs and sharp rollbacks on existing duties — moves that sent stocks skyrocketing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 1,160 points, or 2.8%. The S&P 500 rose almost 3.3%, and the Nasdaq soared about 4.4% as tech stocks led the market relief rally. One analyst called the tariffs deal a “dream scenario” for tech. Under the truce, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will fall from 145% to 30%, while China will cut duties on American goods from 125% to 10%, both for an initial 90-day window. The rollback is far more aggressive than many expected and signals what negotiators described as “substantial progress” toward a longer-term resolution. For markets, it’s a welcome reprieve from geopolitical brinkmanship. As Monday’s market movement made clear, the deal is functioning as a pressure release for investor fears, not to mention a global supply chain that’s been creaking and grinding under the strain. The sharp rally in major indexes further reflected that pivot, with the Nasdaq leading the charge and tech stocks in particular benefitting from easing supply chain constraints. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks rallied, with Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) up 8.1%, Apple (AAPL-0.39%) adding 6.3%, Nvidia up 5.4%, and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) rising 6.8%. Wedbush analysts called the deal a “huge win for the market and bulls,” noting that the cuts likely take a near-term U.S. recession “off the table.” Analysts at the firm now expect the focus to shift from the economic doom-and-gloom of the past six weeks toward a more normalized growth outlook. Other analysts questioned the point of all the upheaval. Either way, the path forward is not entirely clear. Major issues remain unresolved, particularly restrictions around advanced chips and AI hardware, including Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) H20 chips. But for now, the tariff thaw marks a major inflection point. Investors will have plenty more to chew on this week, with a host of economic indicators set to land and the last major earnings report of the first quarter set to hit as well. Walmart (WMT+0.77%) results are due Thursday and should provide an inside look at consumer sentiment, especially among hard-pressed American households.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession. The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month. “The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.” The Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.) It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year. US stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports. In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant. Both sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors. “No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.” Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us. Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth. Tech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%. Stocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%. Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's $2B AI Startup Thinking Machines Lab Sets $50M Investment Minimum, Backed By Andreessen Horowitz And Sequoia Capital

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Mira Murati, the former chief technology officer of OpenAI and a central figure behind ChatGPT, is launching her own AI startup, and she’s doing it in blockbuster fashion. Thinking Machines Lab, the AI company founded by Murati early this year, is raising a $2 billion seed round at a $10 billion valuation. According to Business Insider, the round is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, with support from Sequoia Capital and other top-tier investors. Those interested in backing the venture are being asked to commit a minimum of $50 million per check, a staggering requirement for what would be one of the largest seed rounds in startup history. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The startup's ambition is to reshape the way artificial intelligence is built and understood. According to the company’s website, Thinking Machines Lab will focus on making AI “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable,” highlighting a shift toward both transparency and user control. That positioning places the company in direct conceptual competition with AI giants like OpenAI, Google's Gemini, Elon Musk's xAI, and Anthropic, which are all currently racing to define the next generation of large language models and autonomous systems, Business Insider reported. Murati spent more than six years at OpenAI, contributing to the development of ChatGPT and other advanced AI research projects. According to Business Insider, she was briefly appointed interim CEO in November 2023, after the board unexpectedly removed Sam Altman, a decision that triggered internal upheaval across the company. Following Altman's reinstatement just days later, Murati returned to her position as chief technology officer.

Andreessen Horowitz, the legendary venture capital firm that previously backed Facebook and Airbnb ABNB, Financial Times reported, is leading the round alongside Sequoia Capital, known for its investments in Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and WhatsApp, Fortune says. Their involvement may signal strong institutional belief in Murati's long-term potential. Thinking Machines Lab is also assembling a brain trust of former OpenAI engineers and scientists. According to The Founders Magazine, team members include Bob McGrew, former head of research at OpenAI, Alec Radford, one of the minds behind the original GPT, Barret Zoph, a top researcher on ChatGPT, and John Schulman, co-lead of the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technique that powers modern AI safety. See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Few early-stage startups command minimum investments in the tens of millions. According to Business Insider, Murati’s $50 million threshold is a practical necessity since training large models and building scalable infrastructure requires capital on a massive scale. If the raise closes as expected, Thinking Machines Lab will stand beside OpenAI and Anthropic as one of the most well-capitalized AI startups in the world, Business Insider says, and one of the only ones led by a woman. With technical vision, elite backing, and a mission to open up the black box of AI, Murati's next chapter may reshape the way the world builds and interacts with intelligent systems.

Title: Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety

Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) At about $117 a share, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still trading about 15% below its all-time highs seen in January 2025. Revenues grew more than 110% over the last year, while net profit margins exceeded 50%. With artificial intelligence tunes playing everywhere, do you think Nvidia stock is a good long-term bet at current levels? What about at a 30% discount at about $82 per share? Now we’re talking. So if you think $82 per share for the AI poster-child is a steal, and have some cash ready to go, here’s a clever trade. The Trade: 12% yield at 30% margin of safety, by selling Put Options NVDA stock is trading at about $117. You can sell a long-dated Put option expiring June 18, 2026, with a strike price of $82, and collect roughly $680 in premium per contract (each contract represents 100 shares). That’s about an 8.3% yield on the $8,200 you’re setting aside for the possibility of buying the stock. Plus, don’t forget, this cash parked in a savings or money market account will earn an extra 4%. So we’re talking >12% yield overall. Separately, see Tesla Stock To $1,500 And here’s the kicker. You're agreeing to buy Nvidia at $82, a roughly 30% discount to the current market price, only if the stock drops below that level by the expiration date. Think that’s too risky? Want a higher margin of safety - for example 40%? Use a $70 strike instead of $82 strike - your overall earnings will still be an impressive 9% instead of 12%, and you’ll enjoy more peace. The strategy is reliable because large institutions have tested the strategy at scale, and for the right long-term investors, may serve just right. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Sure, I see the 12% return, however, what if Nvidia drops more than 30%, isn’t there some risk? Of course, there is risk. Because, there are two ways this could unfold: In short, you win either way, especially if you're comfortable owning a quality company like Nvidia for the long haul. Is that a good deal though? It could very well be, if you consider three facts -- If you do end up owning NVDA stock, you’re not stuck with some speculative small-cap stock. You're holding a company that is: And The Risk of a Crash Is Lower Than You Think Selling puts is only as good as the business you’re willing to own. With Nvidia, that bar is high. Here’s why: The Bottom Line - Margin of Safety This trade offers an asymmetric risk-reward setup, with a built-in 30% discount. Either way, you come out ahead. These are the kinds of margin-of-safety setups and asymmetric risk-reward tradeoffs that we seek in the Trefis HQ portfolio, which is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Genocide, Blood, and Dividends

Time Published: 2025-05-09T22:00:48Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMay 9, 2025 In the 1987 film Wall Street, Michael Douglas famously played Gordon Gekko, a cutthroat corporate raider. But compared to the Dutch pioneers who founded the world’s first publicly-traded company, Gordon Gekko was a softie. Those Dutch guys were literally cutting throats in pursuit of profit. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the century the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Oh yeah, along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering (IPO), giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders. Without the VOC, we might not have today’s efficient and lucrative stock markets.
