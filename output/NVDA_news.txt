Title: Nvidia goes all in on AI agents and humanoid robots at CES
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-goes-all-in-on-ai-agents-and-humanoid-robots-at-1851733651
Time Published: 2025-01-07T05:22:00Z

As the AI world races toward next-generation breakthroughs, Nvidia (NVDA-5.82%) fortified its position with a flood of new chips, software and services designed to keep the industry plugged into its expanding tech ecosystem. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang announced a suite of AI tools and updates during the first keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Monday, focusing on AI agents — systems that can complete tasks autonomously. Huang demonstrated these capabilities through animated versions of himself in different outfits, showing how AI agents could handle roles like customer service, coding, and research assistance. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future,” Huang said in the keynote. The chipmaker unveiled AI Blueprints, which will help companies build and deploy these AI agents using technology built on Meta’s (META-2.28%) Llama models. These “knowledge robots,” as Nvidia describes them, can analyze large amounts of data, summarize information from videos and PDFs, and take actions based on what they learn. To make this happen, Nvidia partnered with five leading AI companies — CrewAI, Daily, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Weights & Biases — who will help integrate Nvidia’s technology into usable tools for businesses. “These AI agents act like ‘knowledge robots’ that can reason, plan and take action to quickly analyze large quantities of data, summarize and distill real-time insights from video, PDF and other images,” Justin Boitano, Nvidia’s vice president of enterprise AI software products said in a statement. Nvidia also made a major push into robotics, unveiling new tools to help companies simulate and deploy robot workforces. The centerpiece is “Mega,” a new Omniverse Blueprint that lets companies develop, test, and optimize robot fleets in virtual environments before deploying them in real warehouses and factories. “The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,” Huang said during his keynote. To back this claim, Nvidia announced a collection of robot foundation models, including new capabilities for generating synthetic motion data for training humanoid robots. The company says these pre-trained models were developed using massive amounts of data, including millions of hours of autonomous driving and drone footage. A key part of this effort is the new Isaac GR00T Blueprint, which helps solve a major challenge in robotics: generating the massive amounts of motion data needed to train humanoid robots. Instead of the expensive and time-consuming process of collecting real-world data, developers can use GR00T to generate large synthetic datasets from just a small number of human motions. “Collecting these extensive, high-quality datasets in the real world is tedious, time-consuming, and often prohibitively expensive,” Nvidia said in a press release. With the Isaac GR00T blueprint, developers can generate the large data sets needed to train AI models from a small number of human motions. The new tools are already attracting major industry players. KION Group, a supply chain solutions company, is working with Accenture (ACN+0.95%) to use Nvidia’s Mega blueprint to optimize warehouse operations that involve both human workers and robots. Nvidia’s efforts into the physical world didn’t stop there: it announced the expansion of its automobile partners, including with the world’s largest automaker, which will use its accelerated computing and AI for driving assistance capabilities and autonomous vehicles. Toyota (TM+1.18%) will use Nvidia’s DRIVE AGX Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for its next-generation vehicles for driving assistance. Meanwhile, the chipmaker said Aurora (AUR+27.77%) and Continental will both use Nvidia’s DRIVE accelerated compute to deploy driverless trucks through a long-term strategic partnership. On the consumer front — it is CES, after all — Huang showed off the next generation of its RTX Blackwell GPUs, with the four versions priced between $549 and $1,999. The popular gaming chips will be released later this month and in February. And to cap off the keynote, Huang lifted the curtain on Project DIGITS, a palm-sized personal AI supercomputer powerful enough to run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters while GPT-4 is rumored to have 1.76 trillion parameters. The device, which will be available starting at $3,000 from Nvidia and its partners in May, aims to put AI development in more hands. “AI will be mainstream in every application for every industry,” Huang said in a statement. “With Project DIGITS, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers. Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.” Nvidia stock was up 4% before Huang’s CES keynote, with Bank of America (BAC+1.37%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday, with an analyst describing CES as a “positive catalyst” for the company. The stock closed at a record high of $149.43. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

January 06, 2025 22:06 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA LAS VEGAS, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today unveiled the most advanced consumer GPUs for gamers, creators and developers — the GeForce RTX™ 50 Series Desktop and Laptop GPUs. Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor Cores and fourth-generation RT Cores, the GeForce RTX 50 Series delivers breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry and lighting. “Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Fusing AI-driven neural rendering and ray tracing, Blackwell is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.” The GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — the fastest GeForce RTX GPU to date — features 92 billion transistors, providing over 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS) of computing power. Blackwell architecture innovations and DLSS 4 mean the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU by up to 2x. GeForce Blackwell comes to laptops with all the features of desktop models, bringing a considerable upgrade to portable computing, including extraordinary graphics capabilities and remarkable efficiency. The Blackwell generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology extends battery life by up to 40%, and includes thin and light laptops that maintain their sleek design without sacrificing power or performance. NVIDIA DLSS 4 Boosts Performance by Up to 8xDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. It works in unison with the suite of DLSS technologies to increase performance by up to 8x over traditional rendering, while maintaining responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex technology. DLSS 4 also introduces the graphics industry’s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture. Transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models use 2x more parameters and 4x more compute to provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scenes. DLSS 4 will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs in over 75 games and applications the day of launch. NVIDIA Reflex 2 introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technique to reduce latency in games by updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display. Reflex 2 can reduce latency by up to 75%. This gives gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games and makes single-player titles more responsive. Blackwell Brings AI to ShadersTwenty-five years ago, NVIDIA introduced GeForce 3 and programmable shaders, which set the stage for two decades of graphics innovation, from pixel shading to compute shading to real-time ray tracing. Alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX Neural Shaders, which brings small AI networks into programmable shaders, unlocking film-quality materials, lighting and more in real-time games. Rendering game characters is one of the most challenging tasks in real-time graphics, as people are prone to notice the smallest errors or artifacts in digital humans. RTX Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face and 3D pose data as input, and uses generative AI to render a temporally stable, high-quality digital face in real time. RTX Neural Faces is complemented by new RTX technologies for ray-traced hair and skin. Along with the new RTX Mega Geometry, which enables up to 100x more ray-traced triangles in a scene, these advancements are poised to deliver a massive leap in realism for game characters and environments. The power of neural rendering, DLSS 4 and the new DLSS transformer model is showcased on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with Zorah, a groundbreaking new technology demo from NVIDIA. Autonomous Game CharactersGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs bring industry-leading AI TOPS to power autonomous game characters in parallel with game rendering.

Nvidia stock surged 5% on Monday and was edging close to record highs as investors awaited CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech. at the Consumer Electronics Show. Shares of Nvidia hit an intra-day high of $152.16, just shy of its record high of $152.89. Huang is scheduled to kick off CES with an opening speech on Monday at 6:30 p.m. PST in Las Vegas. Bank of America noted that Nvidia stock tends to surge around Jensen Huang's CES remarks. The stock jumped 6.4% on the day of Huang's CES speech in 2024, which was followed by an extended surge in the two days following his speech. "It was a monstrous Monday, with NVDA being the most notable move," Bank of America said in a recent note. "NVDA had been extremely range bound for the 4-5 months heading into it, and the buyside was obsessed with the inevitable cloud capex cliff." The bank alluded to the fact that Nvidia is facing a similar setup heading into this year's trade show as investors continue to worry about the possibility of an end to the AI capex boom. Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has traded in a sideways range for about six months. For Huang's upcoming CES speech, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said the integration of AI into robotics could be a big topic of discussion. "We look for updates on Robotics strategy from silicon to software and emergence of 'physical AI' theme," Arya said, adding that he expects Nvidia to make "a strong push" into robotics. Other areas Arya is watching include Nvidia's launch of new PC gaming cards that will be variants of its next-generation AI chip architecture, Blackwell, and the potential for Nvidia to enter the PC market via an AI PC that would likely be made via a partnership but could also be a standalone Nvidia product. Arya is also looking for an update on Nvidia's data center business, specifically surrounding the ongoing ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell chips and upgraded variants expected to launch in the second half of the year, including the GB300 and B300. Finally, Arya said he expects a teaser from Nvidia on its Rubin AI GPU, which is scheduled to succeed the Blackwell chip in 2026. "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA's platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets," Arya said. Analysts at Citi also have Nvidia stock on "positive catalyst watch" during this week's CES event. Arya rates Nvidia at "Buy" and calls it a "top pick" with a $190 price target, representing upside of 26% from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Nvidia’s (NVDA-5.82%) shares climbed by close to 5% on Monday in anticipation of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. The chipmaker is expected to make major artificial intelligence-focused product announcements at the annual Las Vegas trade show. Bank of America (BAC+1.37%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday outlining its expectations for CES. “[W]e still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets,” Vivek Arya, a research analyst at Bank of America Global Research, said in the note. Arya said the bank is expecting updates on Nvidia’s robotics strategy, such as its Jetson Thor robot computer, which would leverage its silicon and software capabilities for physical AI. “The challenge in our view is however making the products reliable enough, cheap enough and pervasive enough to spawn credible business models,” Arya said, adding that robotics could be seen as “cool but niche,” similar to the metaverse and autonomous cars. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said. Bank of America is also looking for Nvidia to announce the launch of its RTX 50-series GPUs, “[p]otential entry into” the AI PC market through a partnership or on its own, and updates to its data center business, including on its current-generation Blackwell platform. The chipmaker’s shares stalled toward the end of last year after reaching record highs driven by the AI boom. Production and shipping of the highly anticipated Blackwell chips were delayed due to a now-fixed design flaw that sent its shares falling. The company also saw its shares tumble after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws. In June, Huang announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for this year and a next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin coming in 2026. Arya said announcements on “timeline acceleration” for Rubin could help the chipmaker “regain control of the (overstated) narrative around custom-chips from cloud vendors overtaking/reducing need to buy NVDA’s merchant silicon.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) rose 5% on Monday after BofA Securities reaffirmed a "Buy" rating and raised its price target to $190. That's also as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 begins with the semiconductor and AI industries looking to Nvidia as a central point for future innovation and growth. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia is dominant in emerging markets and is financially strong, BofA's analyst notes, with a Piotroski Score of 9 and 152% YoY revenue growth. Nvidia has a market cap of $3.65 trillion that hasn't escaped Wall Street's notice and consistently adds to its 1.31 analyst consensus rating. CEO Jensen Huang will dole out an Nvidia keynote and spill the beans on groundbreaking technology advances at CES. Announcements that may take place cover safer environments through Jetson Thor platform advancements, physical AI innovations, RTX 50xx, which includes faster GDDR7 memory and better neural rendering, and Blackwell PC gaming cards. The AI PC market could be the next battlefield, according to BofA, and Nvidia's there either through partnerships or even its own standalone CPU. Along with updates on the company's data centre offerings, such as upgrades to the Blackwell lineup and teasers for next-gen Rubin architectures, this also makes for highly anticipated content. As we look forward to 2025, Nvidia is the leader in the AI and semiconductor industries with strong financials and a robust innovation pipe in hand. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: A Wall Street Analyst On Super Micro Computer: “Having Stood On The Sidelines Of The Nascent GB200 Cycle So Far, We Believe SMCI Could Re-enter The Blackwell Fray With The Launch Of GB300”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. It is a rare sight these days to find positive analyst commentary on Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a major retailer of servers and AI racks, given the company's long list of troubles, including allegations of accounting malpractice, the unceremonious exit of a well-regarded audit firm, and ongoing filing delays for the company's financial statements. Yet, Lynx Equity has been consistently bullish on Super Micro Computer throughout its long litany of travails. Today, as NVIDIA gears up for its keynote address at the CES, the firm has published another investment note on SMCI's prospects. Lynx Equity Reiterates $60 PT on $SMCI, Cites $NVDA Keynote as Positive Catalyst Analyst comments: "According to media reports, the NVDA keynote at CES today is expected to touch upon next-generation GB300, a platform that will likely require even more stringent cooling… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 6, 2025 To wit, Lynx Equity views NVIDIA's keynote address at the CES as a positive catalyst for Super Micro Computer. "According to media reports, the NVDA keynote at CES today is expected to touch upon next-generation GB300, a platform that will likely require even more stringent cooling specifications than GB200." While delineating its bullish stance on SMCI, the firm notes: This aligns with Lynx Equity's previous note on the topic back in December, when it had taken pains to highlight Super Micro Computer's "critical position in the all-important business of installing AI infrastructure," especially in light of the stock's receding delisting odds. As a refresher, the Nasdaq exchange has now given Super Micro Computer until the 25th of February 2025 to publish its annual report for its FY 2024 and the requisite financial statements pertaining to its fiscal Q1 2025, thereby removing the hanging threat of a damaging delisting. Nonetheless, Lynx Equity does highlight ongoing threats for the volatile stock: As to the last point, Lynx Equity believes that it is imperative for Super Micro Computer to raise additional liquidity "to address its large inventory and free up working capital for the company’s capital-intensive AI server business." The firm goes on to note: "A debt-financed deal could be positive for common shares if the company remains relevant in the growing business of liquid-cooled data centers." Accordingly, Lynx Equity has reiterated its $60 price target for Super Micro Computer shares, implying a ~70 percent upside potential from current levels.

Title: Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang on AI: The wave is coming

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Given the exponential market run-ups in AI stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), the space is sure to be on many investors' minds right now — but the seasoned tech players know that too much hype can sometimes spell disaster. “I think the AI wave is coming,” said Yahoo co-founder and AME Cloud Ventures founding partner Jerry Yang to Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the 100th episode of his Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). “Maybe it’s upon us, depending on who you talk to.” “We’ve seen a few waves of technology, and with each one of these waves, [we] go through this hype cycle,” said Yang. “And then you cross the chasm and then you come to the other side.” Yang, 56, has spent his entire career betting on (and mostly winning at) technology. He was a doctoral student at Stanford when he co-founded “Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web” with his friend and classmate David Filo in 1994. Their pet project served as a website directory that gathered steam and attention immediately. The name was initially changed to "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web." After receiving a million hits by the end of 1994, the duo did another name switch. Yahoo (an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle) was incorporated and launched in 1995. Explosive growth fueled by the rocket-ship like adoption of the internet led them to take the company public in 1996. A meeting with Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma in 1997 would ultimately benefit Yang and the company when Yahoo purchased a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1 billion in 2005, an investment it would later sell for $7.6 billion in 2012. Yang served as CEO of Yahoo from 2007 to 2009 and left the company in 2012. Yahoo has been owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) since Sept. 2021. Today, Yang is an early stage investor at AME Cloud Ventures — making bold bets like quantum computing with Rigetti Computing (RGTI) — and spends the other part of his time as a Silicon Valley statesman handing out guidance to aspiring visionaries. One advantage newer companies in the AI domain have over their more senior tech predecessors is the benefit of hindsight. “When we were building the company and the internet was being built, there was no playbook,” said Yang. “It was literally the Wild West and you were trying to figure out what [everything] looked like.” Read more: why Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is so bullish on AI agents By 2000, Yahoo was “one of the more valuable companies for no apparent reason other than the stock market driving it up,” explained Yang. “And then the bubble busted, and then it took a few years before all the valuations and the users and the infrastructure really caught up to the hype.” AI could be on a similar pathway given the demand and market enthusiasm as demonstrated in 2024, when Nvidia became the most valuable public company in the world. OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, currently boasts a heady valuation of $157 billion with users turning to the service en masse — but no profits to speak of yet. Fellow tech veteran Tom Siebel, founder and CEO of C3.ai (AI), said on Opening Bid that generative AI was “getting pretty frothy,” noting that it provided “important technology services [and] solves some very real problems.” However, OpenAI “could be gone next Monday,” he cautioned, adding that leaders at these companies “think they’re building God in a box.” Bullishness in general on the AI space could bear out. “If you go now to certain parts of [San Francisco], it’s AI central,” said Yang. “The amount of talent [and] people that are starting to put not only capital but resources and energy into AI is astounding.” “I think it’s going to be part bubble,” he continued. “But the reality also is going to be really incredible.” Three times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Hottest Large-Cap Stock Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Hottest Large-Cap Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other large-cap stocks. This article will analyze several prominent large-cap stocks that are currently exerting significant influence on market dynamics. These stocks are currently considered "hot" because their stock prices are relatively more volatile, and they draw the attention of a large pool of investors. These stocks are the most talked about, with high trading volumes, large price actions and overall hot atmosphere surrounding them currently. Large-Cap Stocks are usually household names, stocks which even the non-investing population has heard of. They are considered safer investments than small-cap stocks, so they will naturally bring a larger volume when it comes to trading. Price change over the past week is the first parameter we will analyze when talking about the hottest Large-Cap Stocks. Another parameter which we will analyze is the volume of shares traded over the course of the past trading week. Even with Large-Caps, when investors and traders see large changes in volume, they could get spooked or could see an opportunity to jump in and aboard the train. The first days of the new year, as well as the last days of the year gone, are usually very volatile. There are a lot of speculation and tax-loss harvesting going on, which affects the broader market dynamics. On the other hand, investors who took profit in 2024 are looking for new investments to start their new investment year strong. The New Year's Day holiday also affects the trading continuity, further deepening the volatility. To see which firms kicked this year off in the red, you can check out the following article. The Large-Caps listed here are all market titans, with market caps over $200 billion dollars. A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Return: 4.27% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had a great week in the market. It was the strongest stock of the "Magnificent 7", closing 4.27% in green. Since the AI sector doesn't show signs of stopping in 2025, investors are positioning their portfolios hoping that NVDA can have another great year as it did last year, when it returned 171%. The demand is still strong, pushing market leaders such as NVDA to new heights. NVDA is still years ahead of its competition when it comes to the products and services it provides, so this competitive advantage could still fuel further growth in 2025. Analysts are expecting further earnings-per-share growth rates over the course of this year, so NVDA, even after a nearly 200% surge in 2024, is still considered "hot" and the leader of the Magnificent 7. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the hottest large-cap stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Dumps $2,500,000,000 Portfolio, Pours Millions Into New Asset: Report

Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is exploring new opportunities after dumping more than $2.5 billion in stocks. The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024, having nearly tripled in value. It has become one of the best-known AI stocks in recent years, because its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI applications. According to Jon Peddie Research, the market for add-on GPUs grew 47.9% between the second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 (the latest quarter for which data is available) [0]Jon Peddie Research. Shipments of graphics AIBs see significant surge in Q2 2024. Accessed Dec 13, 2024.View all sources. Nvidia is the biggest player in this market, and its GPUs power some of the most prominent AI products, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But it isn’t a monopoly, and there are a few publicly traded companies that compete with Nvidia. Nvidia controls more than four-fifths of the market for add-on GPUs. But there are two other companies with some market share: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Source: Jon Peddie Research. Before graphics processing units became prized for industrial computing activities such as running AI models and Bitcoin mining, they were mainly used in gaming PCs and video game consoles — to, as their name suggests, process graphics. AMD has been Nvidia’s main rival ever since their gaming days, but both companies now derive most of their revenue from selling chips and services to data centers. AMD isn’t quite as specialized in AI chips as Nvidia is, and it has a fraction of its market share. But in 2023, several of the world’s largest tech companies switched from using Nvidia chips to AMD’s Instinct MI300X chip for new AI projects.

Intel is probably more of a household name than AMD or Nvidia. If you’re reading this article on a Windows computer, there’s a good chance there’s an Intel processor in it. However, Intel is newer to the market for GPUs and other AI chips than Nvidia and AMD. Intel launched both its first GPU and its first specialized AI chip in 2022 — although as shown on the graph above, it hasn’t made much of a dent in the market shares of Nvidia and AMD. Together, Nvidia, AMD and Intel make up just about 100% of the market for AI chips, but these three are not entirely alone in the chipmaking space. Many big tech companies are developing their own AI hardware, too — they just don’t sell very much of it at the moment. These minor chipmakers include: Alphabet (GOOG). Amazon (AMZN). Apple (AAPL). IBM (IBM). Microsoft (MSFT). Qualcomm (QCOM). In some cases, these companies have negligible shares of the overall AI chip market because they’ve primarily developed chips for “in-house” use — to power their own AI products and systems. For example, Microsoft is a major backer of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Likewise, Amazon is a major shareholder of Anthtropic, a private company that developed Claude, a large language model (LLM) that competes with ChatGPT. Alphabet is the maker of Gemini, another ChatGPT rival. The companies listed in the previous section control tiny shares of the AI chip market — but that doesn’t mean they’re tiny companies. All of them are blue-chip tech stocks, and all except IBM and Qualcomm are worth trillions of dollars. A well-diversified portfolio will likely have exposure to some or all of these stocks, either through index funds or individual shares. When it comes to Nvidia’s biggest competitors, AMD and Intel, it’s hard to say what the future holds. Wall Street analysts generally believe that there’s a place for AMD in the chip market of the future, but they’re more pessimistic about Intel. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover AMD, 73% give it a “buy” rating, with the rest rating it a “hold.” That’s not a bad percentage, although it’s lower than Nvidia’s. (For reference, 92.5% of TipRanks-surveyed analysts covering Nvidia rate it a “buy,” with the rest rating it a “hold.”) Nvidia and AMD have been vying for control of the GPU market for decades. Nvidia has the lead right now, but AMD has recently had some successes with its AI chipmaking efforts, such as big orders from Microsoft, Meta (META) and OpenAI. However, analysts are more bearish on Intel, which entered the AI chip market later and has failed to get as much traction as Nvidia or AMD. As shown above, Intel currently accounts for less than 1% of the add-on GPU market. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover Intel, 76% rate it a “hold,” and 21% rate it a “sell,” with only 3% rating it a “buy.” » MORE: Best-performing semiconductor stocks Neither the author nor editor held positions in the aforementioned investments at the time of publication.

Asset allocation dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories. For a long time now, it seems like the stock market has had a “theme of the year.” Clearly in 2024 it was AI, while 2023 was the year of recovery from 2022, which was a year of panic over a recession that never came. This is odd, as past trends have lasted several years. From 2012 to 2014, for example, it was momentum driven by the Fed’s quantitative easing after the financial crisis. And the dot-com-bubble years spanned more or less from 1994 to 2000. So will 2025 be another “theme year,” or will we see markets shift back to embracing longer-term trends? (Hint: I’m expecting the former, and we’re going to front-run the main theme I see for 2025 to grab ourselves some nice 10%+ dividends paid monthly.) A quick glance at 2024 offers some clues as to where things are headed. Bull Market Above we see the performance of the benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple) and NASDAQ 100 (in orange), as of this writing. As you can see, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 rose almost the same amount. That’s surprising; we’d expect the NASDAQ’s tilt toward AI names like Amazon.com (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) to propel it ahead of the S&P 500. But things are, of course, more complicated than that. For one, consider that 61% of large American companies are planning to use AI to automate tasks. In other words, it’s not just tech benefiting from AI, but firms from across the entire economy. This is good for the whole market, so it’s not surprising that the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 would more or less keep pace with one another. The S&P 500 now has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 28, a level it’s only reached a few times in the last 40 years: late 2019, mid 2008, early 2001 and late 1997. Each of these peaks, unfortunately, came right before a bear market. However, there is good news here. First, in 2001, 2008 and 2019, these peaks were hit after a bear market had already begun. In other words, the market hit this high valuation because earnings fell, decreasing the “E” in the P/E ratio and driving up the number overall. So today isn’t really comparable to those eras. The bad news, though, is that 1997 was like today. At the height of the dot-com bubble, stocks priced in future gains that didn’t appear. If AI flops, we could see a similar correction to the one that occurred in the late 1990s. The problem is that there’s no way to know if that pullback will happen in 2025 or, say, 2030 (or at all). So selling now could result in lost money in the long term. With all this in mind, my prediction is this: 2025 will be the year more investors look beyond stocks, particularly for ways to profit from the still-strong market while hedging their downside. That path leads straight to corporate bonds, which yield 7.3% as I write this, for companies with credit ratings of BB+ or below. And our favorite income plays, closed-end funds (CEFs), let us tap corporate bonds for even higher dividends to the tune of 10%+. Our play, then, is to front-run the crowd into these funds, which include the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), a CEF yielding 10.1% that pays dividends monthly. When it comes to high-yield bonds, many people irrationally worry about defaults. But here’s the truth: Even in the worst crisis, default rates would only spike to around 10%, so if you buy a CEF like GHY, which has bonds from 405 different issuers, you’d sharply limit your risk of loss. Bear in mind, too, that the fund is run by five portfolio managers from Prudential (PRU), a company with a deep bench of talent and resources, providing even more reassurance here. Moreover, the default rates on high-yield bonds are currently around 1%—imperceptible in most CEFs, including GHY. This little-known fund is also well diversified across sectors: GHY Holdings GHY is also well diversified around the world, with a strong base (47.5% of assets) in the US. That’s a nice setup for 2025, when interest rates are expected to decline in the US, sending capital looking for higher returns elsewhere. Also, the fund yields 10.1%, and that yield is pretty reliable, as GHY hasn’t reduced distributions in five years, and in 2024 it out-earned its payouts, suggesting dividends remain covered. Then there’s the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV). This is the main CEF valuation metric, and right now GHY is discounted, trading at 4.7% below its portfolio value. That discount faded steadily through 2024 before plateauing at its current level in November. If 2025 boosts demand from investors looking for high-yield alternatives to stocks, as I expect it to, GHY’s discount could shrink further. But even if demand holds steady, GHY still has reason to climb, thanks to its strong long-term performance history. As you can see below, GHY (in purple) has more than doubled the corporate-bond benchmark index fund (in orange) over the last decade: GHY Outperforms Double-digit yields and this wind at the fund’s back are strong selling points, with the high price of stocks sealing the deal. Add in the diversification away from stocks that GHY provides, and the fund is an attractive option now. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off

Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a “Santa Claus" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Bank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. "What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software," Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, "the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product." Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. "In our view, these are short-term issues," he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data. To be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however. Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon. Read about the realignment of power in Washington here. Tesla shares rose more than 7% Friday as the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Nvidia Stock Vs. Custom AI Chips: Should Investors Worry?

Signage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Nvidia stock had a stellar 2024, rising by almost 3x to about $135 per share. Business has boomed led by the surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the backbone of the generative artificial intelligence era. That said, over the last month or so investors appear to have their eyes on another sector of the semiconductor market, namely ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that could play a bigger role in AI computing. This comes after two major ASIC players, Broadcom and Marvell Technology, reported a surge in demand for their ASICs from large cloud customers in the most recent quarters. Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? For instance, Broadcom’s sales from its custom AI chips and networking processors surged by 220% to $12.2 billion in 2024, up from $3.8 billion in revenue that the company generated from AI silicon in FY’23. To be sure, Nvidia’s sales are head and shoulders above, estimated to come in at about $129 billion this fiscal year, but its growth rates are slowing. So could ASICs threaten Nvidia’s AI dominance as the market matures? Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. ASICS vs GPUs ASICs have been around for more than five decades. However, they are seeing renewed interest in the AI era. While GPUs from companies such as Nvidia are pretty versatile and can be programmed for AI as well as other tasks, ASICs are custom-designed semiconductors built to perform specific tasks giving them certain advantages versus general processors. By focusing on targeted functionalities these chips offer several advantages versus GPUs for AI. For instance, these specialized chips could be more cost-effective than GPUs, which are designed for a wider range of applications. ASICs also consume less electricity and this makes them ideal for data centers aiming to reduce electricity costs - a key cost of operating large AI systems. ASICs can also achieve higher performance for dedicated tasks than general-purpose GPUs from Nvidia or AMD as they are purpose-built. These chips could be well suited for large cloud computing providers given that they operate at a scale that can justify the design and development costs of ASICs. For instance, Broadcom, a company that is viewed as the biggest beneficiary of a potential pivot toward ASICs, recently said that three of its hyperscaler customers intend to build clusters of 1 million custom chips across a single network. Change In The AI Space Benefits ASICs Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the significantly front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments just yet. See How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see more customers looking toward ASICs to reduce upfront costs as well as operating costs. The longer-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. ASIC chips customized for inference could also be a top choice for these tasks. There is some historical precedent to this as well. For example, in the the crypto industry, Bitcoin miners initially used GPUs for mining, but some large players have since switched to ASICs as they scaled up given their better hash rates (effectively how many guesses the system makes per second to solve the crypto puzzle) and overall cost-effectiveness. What This Means For Nvidia While NVDA stock has seen strong growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four years; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what lies ahead for Nvidia stock? To be sure, we don’t expect Nvidia’s business to be supplanted by these new waves of processors, given the company’s head start in the AI market and its deeply entrenched CUDA software stack and development tools which results in high switching costs for customers. Moreover, if the market sees a strong shift, Nvidia too could potentially expand its presence in the space. However, Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully account for the potential risks and slowing growth. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, about 32% below the current market price.

Just when you thought your toaster couldn’t get any smarter, CES 2025 is about to prove you wrong. The world’s biggest tech show returns to Las Vegas from Jan. 7-10, promising to stuff artificial intelligence into literally everything that has a power button. The AI gold rush remains in full swing: Samsung’s going all-in with its “AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere” vision — including AI fridges that promise to anticipate temperature changes when you’re unloading groceries — because apparently your lettuce needed a smart assistant. LG is getting oddly personal with what they’re calling “Affectionate Intelligence” (yes, really). Even Samsung’s startup incubator is showing off AI everything – from video production to exercise coaching to energy management. The message is clear: if your gadget doesn’t have AI in 2025, does it even exist? But this year’s real battleground is AI agents. After 2024's mixed bag of AI companions (pour one out for the Humane Pin and the half-baked Rabbit R1), tech giants are betting that what we really want is AI assistants baked into everything we own. The pitch for these empowered AI bots is that you won’t have to open apps for every little task; this tech promises to handle everything from scheduling your day to ordering your coffee, all through natural conversation. Whether they’ll actually deliver this time – or show any actual affection – remains to be seen. And yes, somehow, the TV industry has found its next revolution: a fancier cable. While the exact specs of HDMI 2.2 are still under wraps, it promises to surpass the impressive 10K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates of HDMI 2.1. Translation: Your movies and games are about to get even prettier, smoother, and more detailed — if you can find any 10K content to actually watch. On the computing front, Nvidia (NVDA-5.82%) CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage for what promises to be another leather-jacketed keynote about next-gen GPUs. Industry leaks suggest the RTX 5090 could be up to 70% faster than its predecessor, which already had “unholy power,” according to one reviewer. Not to be outdone, Intel and AMD are also expected to announce chips that will make your current gaming rig feel like a calculator. Speaking of chips, 2025 is shaping up to be the year PC makers try to convince you that your computer isn’t smart enough. After 2024's first wave of AI PCs with Copilot+ buttons and 16GB RAM requirements, Microsoft’s (MSFT-1.42%) next generation promises even more powerful NPUs and AI features. Dell, HP, and friends are hoping you’ll upgrade your Windows 10 machine (which loses support next year) to a shiny new AI-powered PC. Just don’t expect an immediate productivity boost – studies show current AI PC owners actually spend more time figuring out how to talk to their computers than getting actual work done. But hey, at least you’ll feel fancy while your PC makes you feel technologically illiterate. The auto industry continues its transformation into a tech show within a tech show. Hyundai’s (HYMTF-2.37%) Mobis division is set to steal some spotlight with what they’re calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display. This isn’t just a fancy heads-up display, it’s a screen that spans from driver to passenger, promising to overlay navigation, vehicle info, and safety alerts across your entire field of view. Think Iron Man’s helmet display, but for your car. BMW’s not far behind, planning to debut their own take with something called the Panoramic iDrive display. About 100,000 tech enthusiasts, industry professionals, and AI chatbots (kidding — that would make it more like 200,000) will descend upon the Las Vegas Convention Center and Venetian Expo for the event. As always, CES promises to show us the future, or at least what tech companies think we’ll buy in the near future. Whether all these innovations actually make it to market in 2025 is another story entirely, but hey, that’s half the fun of CES. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
