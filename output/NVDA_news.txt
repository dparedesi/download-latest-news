Title: After Months of Calm, Nvidia Earnings Could Spark a Big Stock Market Move

All eyes are on Nvidia heading into the artificial intelligence chip giant's second-quarter earnings report, due after markets close later today. As the world's most valuable public company, Nvidia (NVDA) has more influence than any over the value of the S&P 500 and the more than $1 trillion indexed to it. With a market capitalization of about $4.4 trillion, Nvidia accounts for about 8% of the benchmark index, a whole percentage point more than its next largest component, Microsoft (MSFT). Nvidia's stock is expected to post its biggest post-earnings stock move in over a year, according to recent options pricing. That could translate into a market response that resembles that of a pivotal piece of economic data more than a single company's earnings report. Options data suggests traders expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.9% in either direction on Thursday, the first day of trading after Nvidia's report. The S&P 500 moved more than 0.9% on nearly a third of all trading days this year through Tuesday. But that figure is inflated by the tariff tumult that gripped markets in March and April, when the index jumped or fell by at least 1 percentage point on more than half of trading days. So far in the relatively calmer second half of the year, the index has moved more than 0.9% approximately one out of every 10 days. Nvidia's size isn't the only reason its earnings might move the whole market. It has also become an AI bellwether that can move the stocks of AI beneficiaries spanning a range of industries. The company's results, as a gauge of AI demand, exert significant influence over other semiconductor stocks. When Nvidia's results sent its shares plunging more than 8% in late February, the benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 6%, and not just because Nvidia accounts for about 9% of the index. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) tumbled more than 7% the same day, as did chip fabrication equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT). As the notion of what constitutes an "AI stock" has expanded, so has Nvidia's influence. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), nuclear power providers that have struck major data center deals with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), plunged more than 7% and 12%, respectively, following Nvidia's results in February. Server makers Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) saw their shares fall nearly 7% and 16%, respectively, while software provider Palantir (PLTR) slid 5%. The ripple effects of Nvidia's earnings could be even more pronounced now because AI beneficiaries and the "Magnificent Seven," after big gains this year, make up more of the S&P 500 than they did in February. Palantir has added roughly three-quarters of its value in the past 6 months, while Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained more than 50%. Broadcom, one of just nine U.S. companies worth more than $1 trillion, has climbed by more than a third in the same period. Before Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech sent stocks soaring last Friday, tech and AI stocks were having a rough week. Palantir last Wednesday notched its longest losing streak in more than a year. An ETF tracking the "Magnificent Seven" stocks slid 3.5% over the first four days of the week. Investor concerns about an AI bubble, which have repeatedly bubbled up over the past few years, resurfaced last week. Wall Street was unnerved by an MIT survey that found nearly all companies have seen no material benefits from their AI investments. And Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, reportedly said the prior week that investors had become “overexcited” about AI. Those headlines amplified worries that tech valuations had become stretched after a strong rebound off April's "Liberation Day" lows. The S&P 500 IT sector index has risen about 50% since bottoming out on April 8, far outpacing the 30% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent options and stock prices.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Was Dubbed 'Godfather of AI.' The Company Is Betting On These AI Stocks

Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaking giant at the center of the artificial intelligence revolution, has delivered huge returns for investors since its meteoric rise in 2023 and 2024. But the world's most valuable company, led by the so-called "Godfather of AI," CEO Jensen Huang, has investments of its own. The company is required to disclose its portoflio information every quarter using the SEC Form 13-F. This filing offers only a snapshot of Nvidia's portfolio at the end of the quarter. It does not provide any details about gains or losses made from any sales made during the quarter. Here's what Nvidia's AI best looked like at the end of June— By far Nvidia's most valuable holding is CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV), an AI cloud computing provider that went public in March. At the end of June, Nvidia held 24.3 million shares, that amounts to roughly 7% stake in the company, worth a little over $3.9 billion. As of Aug. 26, that stake is valued is close to $2.2 billion, after Coreweave saw almost a third of its share value disappear following disappointing quarterly earnings results. However, shares of CoreWeave have more than doubled from their IPO price of $40 in March to more than $90 in late August. Arm Holdings plc (ARM) is a U.K.-based developer of CPU chip designs whose clients include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google. Nvidia reported a stake of 1.1 million Arm shares worth $178 million in June (about $154 million as of Aug. 26). Applied Digital Corp. (APLD) provides data center space to companies seeking AI compute infrastructure. Its shares have more than doubled this year, including a huge gain after the company agreed to lease data center operations to fellow Nvidia partner CoreWeave. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital. That position, which was worth about $77 million at the end of June, has grown to over $125 million as of Aug. 26. Nebius Group NV (NBIS) is an Amsterdam-based provider of AI infrastructure. Nvidia first disclosed its 1.2 million-share stake in the company in February, and its stock has jumped more than two-thirds since. That means Nvidia's investment has only grown, from nearly $65 million in June to about $85 million at the end of August. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX), a biotech firm focused on AI-powered drug discovery. It's also another Nvidia investment that has seen its stock fall this year, dropping 27%. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Recursion as of June 30. Chinese autonomous vehicle manufacturer WeRide Inc. (WRD) operates a fleet spanning 30 cities across nine countries. Its shares spiked after Nvidia revealed a 1.7-million share stake in February, but they've lost about a third of their value in 2025. Nvidia's portfolio has largely been successful this year, with stocks like CoreWeave actually outperforming the chipmaker itself so far in 2025. Nvidia stock has been no slouch, though, gaining 33% this year and hitting a record high of $182.70 earlier this month. The company is due to report quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, and AI investors will be watching for clues from Huang about the state of the sector.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T16:57:44Z

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Second quarter Revenue estimate: $46.23 billion Third quarter Full year 2026 Source: Bloomberg Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.

August 26, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced leading global enterprises have adopted NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers — a new category of enterprise data center infrastructure powered by the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU — speeding the shift from general-purpose computing clusters to AI factory infrastructure, without a complete data center overhaul. Disney, Foxconn, Hitachi Ltd., Hyundai Motor Group, Lilly, SAP and TSMC are among the first to adopt the servers to accelerate AI, design and simulation applications. “The age of AI has arrived — and enterprises can no longer rely on classical servers alone. They must rearchitect for AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA RTX PRO is the computing platform built for this moment — running today’s IT workloads while powering the AI agents that will transform every company and every industry.” Industry Leaders Tap RTX PRO for AI Acceleration Built with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, RTX PRO Servers use the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture to deliver universal acceleration for demanding enterprise AI workloads spanning agentic and physical AI to advanced design, scientific computing, simulation, graphics and video applications. Industry leaders are deploying RTX PRO Servers to speed their enterprise workloads: Leading companies at the forefront of the AI industrial revolution are building AI factories and transforming their data center infrastructure with RTX PRO Servers. In manufacturing, leaders like PEGATRON, Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT), Siemens and Wistron are using these systems to drive factory automation and simulation. Digital advertising company PubMatic is using RTX PRO Servers to address new AI use cases and high-growth areas like connected TV, commerce media networks and mobile apps. Aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman is enhancing its existing capabilities with these systems to accelerate AI integration into enterprise workstreams to boost productivity and performance. Amdocs, a leading provider of software and services for communications and media companies, is deploying RTX PRO Servers to support the reasoning of its amAIz Agents for transforming telecom customer experiences. Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys will use RTX PRO Servers to accelerate Al-driven simulation across silicon, systems and AI. RTX PRO Servers Accelerate Workloads With Data Center Flexibility RTX PRO Servers accelerate agentic AI and reasoning workloads, allowing researchers and developers to build and deploy autonomous systems that can learn from, adapt to and interact with their surroundings in real time. For example, the NVIDIA Llama Nemotron Super reasoning model delivers up to 3x better price performance when running with NVFP4 on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 GPU compared with FP8 on NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This enables more accurate reasoning at a lower cost. To develop effective physical AI systems, enterprises need to test and optimize their robotic fleets in simulation before deploying to real-world factories. NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers are advancing industrial and physical AI by delivering up to 4x faster performance for digital twin, simulation and synthetic data generation workflows than systems with NVIDIA L40S GPUs. RTX PRO Servers are designed for maximum flexibility to support Windows, Linux and leading hypervisors to offer IT managers a familiar environment for deploying AI at scale without compromise. These servers run virtually every enterprise workload — using air-cooled, PCIe-based, x86 architectures — all with enterprise-grade security, manageability and serviceability. Comprehensive Software SupportNVIDIA RTX PRO Servers and the entire Blackwell architecture product portfolio are supported by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and AI frameworks, libraries and tools that enterprises can deploy on NVIDIA-accelerated clouds, data centers and workstations. RTX PRO Servers are featured in the NVIDIA Enterprise AI Factory validated design for companies looking to build and deploy on-premises AI factories and in the NVIDIA AI Data Platform, a customizable reference design for building modern storage systems for enterprise agentic AI. For physical and industrial AI, RTX PRO Servers running NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models enable physical AI developers to build and deploy applications including digital twins for factory and robot simulation or large-scale synthetic data generation. AvailabilityNVIDIA RTX PRO Servers are available in multiple configurations with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs from Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro, as well as Advantech, Aetina, Aivres, ASRock Rack, ASUS, Compal, Eviden, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, MiTAC Computing, MSI, PEGATRON, QCT, Wistron and Wiwynn. Cloud service providers CoreWeave and Google Cloud are now offering instances accelerated by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, with additional instances coming later this year from AWS, Nebius and Vultr.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The sell-off in the cryptocurrency market deepened over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin BTC$113,307.69 falling below $109,000 for the first time since July 9 and ether (ETH) posting a 13% correction from the record high of around $4,950 it hit just two days ago. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) and CoinDesk 80 (CD80) indices have dropped 2% and 3.3%, respectively, indicating larger losses in the broader altcoin market. The downside volatility toasted leveraged futures bets worth over $900 million, with long positions accounting for the majority of the tally. The slide kicked off on Sunday, when a whale sold 25,000 BTC in an illiquid market, sparking a flash crash. Several theories have been proposed to explain the whale's strategy, the most prominent being that they intentionally removed the bid wall — or block of buy orders — assuming that institutions would buy more through ETFs during the week, thereby lifting prices. "This whale is showing us something bigger, they know the ETF/sovereign bid is infinite. So the only way to win is to force weak hands to puke and then accumulate back into the structural wall," pseudonymous observer SightBringer said on X. According to MEXC Ventures, BTC is now at an inflexion point. It could enter a period of consolidation between $110,000 and $120,000 or break lower toward $105,000 to $100,000. "The absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish Fed policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed inflows, is likely to drive BTC into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution," MEXC's Investment Director Leo Zhao said in an email. Similarly, the consensus remains bullish on ether. However, the sharp decline from Sunday's record suggests a sustained breakout to new highs will probably require a significant catalyst beyond just corporate treasury adoption. XRP, meanwhile, lacks a clear directional trend. "With Bollinger Bands constricting and RSI sitting at a neutral 44, but thin on buying volume, the chart is whispering of a potential retest of $2.60 to $2.00," Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget said. "A break above the $3.10 level with conviction and volume, and a run toward $3.40 could follow. But derivative markets are skewed short, and upside stays guarded until momentum firms." In traditional markets, the Treasury yield curve, represented by the spread between 10- and two-year yields and 30- and two-year yields, continues to steepen as traders bet on a September Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, longer-duration Japanese government bond yields are on the verge of hitting new multidecade highs, which could potentially inject volatility into global financial markets. Stay alert!

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock just hit a record high of $184.48/share and is currently trading near $180. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $0.98/share on $45.91 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $1.06/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company’s earnings have grown nicely over the last few years. In 2020, the company earned $0.15/share. In 2021, earnings jumped to $0.25. Then, in 2022 earnings grew to $0.44. In 2023, earnings slid to $0.33 before exploding higher. In 2024, earnings grew to $1.30. In 2025, earnings are expected to grow to $2.99. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow to $4.42 and grow again to $6.03 in 2027! That growth is largely due to the very strong demand for its A.I. and crypto related chips. Technically, the stock is acting very well and just hit a fresh record high. The stock is trading above its 50 day moving average line (DMA) and above its longer-term 200 day moving average line which are both healthy signs. Furthermore, the stock is “only” 3% below its record high and can easily gap up to new highs if earnings are strong. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall if earnings fail to impress. NVIDIA’s earnings are getting a lot of attention because big trends like artificial intelligence, new rules from governments, and global demand could impact the bottom line. Investors want to know if the strong need for AI chips will continue, how export limits and global trading rules will affect sales—especially to places like China—and whether other new technologies might start to matter more for NVIDIA’s business. When results are reported, people will be watching closely to see how these things impact NVIDIA’s future. Here are some questions investors will be asking: Will AI stay a major driver going forward? How will regulations and international markets affect business? Could changes in technology or global demand shift the company’s growth path? How does the crypto market impact earnings? The stock has has established itself as a true market leader, demonstrating exceptional performance and influence across the tech sector and broader market. NVIDIA has significantly outpaced the overall market, driven by its pivotal role in the artificial intelligence revolution, crypto, and other important areas in our economy. Market strategists consider NVIDIA "the tell to the market," emphasizing its influence on overall market trends. The company's consistent outperformance, beating revenue estimates in the last several quarters, coupled with analysts' positive long-term outlook, underscores its position as a bellwether for the tech sector and a key driver for the broader market. Here’s the company profile, according to Yahoo!

Nvidia (NVDA) stock’s rapid rise on the back of booming AI demand has already made the chipmaker the world’s most valuable company. Most Wall Street analysts think its stock still has room to climb. Expectations are on the rise ahead of the company’s earnings after the bell Wednesday, with Baird on Monday bumping its price target up to $225 from $195, after Stifel over the weekend lifted its to $212 from $202. Several others, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Wedbush, lifted theirs last week. Those targets are consistent with most others on the Street. Of the 14 analysts with current ratings surveyed by Visible Alpha, 10 have targets between $200 and $225, with two at or just above $190, and one that calls the stock a "buy" without a target. Just one expects the stock to decline from its recent levels to $155. The stock rose 1% Monday to close just under $180, and has added over a third of its value in 2025 so far. "We continue to believe that NVDA’s leadership positioning in AI infrastructure remains unchallenged," Stifel analysts said. They pointed to optimism around improving China sales after Nvidia struck a revenue-sharing deal with the Trump administration in order to resume sales of AI chips to the region, and Trump signaled the company could win more licenses for future chips. Baird similarly highlighted Nvidia's strong position and "lack of relevant competition for the medium term," as well as signs of an acceleration in shipments of its GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip. The chipmaker is widely expected to report another quarterly sales record, despite some headwinds from export restrictions that were in place before Nvidia's recent revenue-sharing deal.

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

U.S. equities were mixed and little changed at midday as the market awaited more key corporate earnings reports this week, including from Nvidia (NVDA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell, while the Nasdaq gained. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the beverage giant announced it was paying $18 billion to purchase Peet's Coffee parent JDE Peet's, and intends to split into two parts: coffee and soft drinks. Shares of furniture retailers RH (RH), Wayfair (W), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled after President Donald Trump said he would soon be putting tariffs on furniture imports. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares dropped on a downgrade from Bank of America, which said that while the Sydney Sweeney ad campaign may boost the clothing retailer in the near term, tariffs would likely hurt results. Netflix (NFLX) shares advanced on indications the biggest streaming service's animated film "Kpop Demon Hunters," which was shown in movie theaters over the weekend, was a box-office hit. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) rose on positive comments from Cantor Fitzgerald, which reiterated its "overweight" rating on the chipmaker. Intel (INTC) shares were up again after a 5.5% jump on Friday after the U.S. took about a 10% stake in the struggling semiconductor manufacturer. Oil futures were higher. Gold prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower. TradingView

AI GPU giant NVIDIA's H20 chips have been banned in China, suggests a report which quotes investment bank Jefferies. NVIDIA's H20 GPUs have been at the center of US trade tensions with China, after the Trump administration granted the firm licenses to sell them, multiple reports surfaced about Chinese discomfort with using the GPUs due to their US origin. However, one snippet of an investment note purportedly from Jefferies shared on social media claims that the H20 GPUs have been completely banned in China, which prevents Chinese firms from placing orders with NVIDIA. In a note purportedly belonging to Jefferies and shared on X, the investment bank outlines that Chinese authorities have completely banned NVIDIA H20 AI GPU sales in the country. The note follows several recent reports that have claimed that NVIDIA has asked some supply chain partners to halt H20 production. Jefferies also quotes these reports, as it outlines that media reports indicate that the H20 can no longer be sold in China. However, the bank also adds that "our industry checks indicate China has officially banned the procurement of H20 and other 'downgraded US AI chips' until further notice. As a result, Chinese entities are now forbidden from buying the NVIDIA GPUs, which appears to be a step up over earlier reports that have indicated that the Chinese government had simply required state-linked computing clusters to use at least 50% of domestic AI chips. As a result, Jefferies notes that "no Chinese companies will place orders with NVDA." The bank also adds that its channel checks in Taiwan have yielded the same results as media reports. "Our industry checks in Taiwan also indicate NVDA has suspended all packaging and server production work related to H20, also 'until further notice,' says the bank. As a result, Jefferies concludes that NVIDIA will be unable to generate any AI chip revenue from China, "likely until the US and China come to an agreement on trade." If the note bears fruit, then NVIDIA could see more headaches in the Asian country just as it is about to report its earnings. The shares are flat in premarket trading and enter the week after having lost 1.5% over the past five trading days. Since NVIDIA is in quiet period ahead of its earnings, it cannot comment on news, which creates an ample opportunity for short sellers to target the stock on any expected weakness. 1) According to Jefferey's note on the 24th, it suggests fimr's industry checks indicate that "China has OFFICIALLY BANNED the procurement of H20 AND other downgraded U.S. AI chips until further notice" It also said that its checks in Taiwan "indicate $NVDA has suspended all… pic.twitter.com/0OBtCdqE8Z Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
