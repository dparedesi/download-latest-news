The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom helped push the major indexes higher Tuesday after a raft of partnership announcements. Meanwhile, shares of a cruise operator encountered rough seas as adverse weather and cost pressures weighed on its outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record run Tuesday as the Federal Reserve also kicked off its two-day meeting, with expectations running high that policymakers will decide to lower interest rates by another quarter point Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, the Dow rose 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.8% to set fresh closing records. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market moves. Nvidia (NVDA) shares powered up 5% to an all-time high after CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote speech at the company's developers conference in Washington, D.C. The event brought a flurry of announcements from Nvidia, including a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm, whose shares soared nearly 23%. Nvidia also said it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and team up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) gained close to 12% after the biotechnology firm posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Strong sales of eczema treatment Dupixent and skin cancer treatment Libtayo helped drive the performance. Regeneron also said it plans to resubmit an application for a higher-dose version of Eylea, a treatment for various diseases that affect the retina. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), manufacturers of radio-frequency chips for smartphones and other devices, announced a plan to merge. Both semiconductor makers have been navigating headwinds related to major customer Apple (AAPL), which began developing its own modem chips for use in its devices. Shares of both companies added about 6% following the merger announcement. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares surged 8% after the package delivery giant topped analysts' estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share. The company highlighted progress on a turnaround plan that includes efforts to streamline operations, close underutilized facilities, and reduce its workforce, with 50,000 positions cut so far this year. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) shares climbed 3.9% after the payments provider said it would partner with ChatGPT operator OpenAI. Users who are shopping on ChatGPT will be able to check out using PayPal, while PayPal will connect its global merchant network with ChatGPT to provide opportunities for sales on the AI platform. Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on life science and technology properties, missed estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a key measure of REIT profitability. The firm also lowered its full-year AFFO forecast, pointing to lower occupancy projections in North America and slumping demand in the life science industry. Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities plunged nearly 20%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) sank 8.5%. The cruise operator's revenue for the third quarter came in slightly below expectations, and its outlook for the fourth quarter also fell short of forecasts. Weather disruptions along with increased operating and interest expenses contributed to the cloudy outlook.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia, already the world leader in chips crucial for artificial intelligence, wants to make its technology central to everyday life. That means everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday. With AI already playing a major role in consumers’ lives and the economy, that kind of ubiquity would cement Nvidia’s role in a tech arms race now spanning the globe. Nvidia’s at a critical juncture. It has partnered with the world’s top companies, has the ear of President Donald Trump and became the first public firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation over the summer. But it’s also navigating a bevy of challenges, including escalating concerns about whether the AI market is a bubble waiting to burst, growing competition from rival chipmakers AMD and Qualcomm and trade restrictions. In the face of that competition, Nvidia is sending a clear message: While its semiconductors power most of the world’s AI data centers, the company does way more than just design chips. Huang also told CNN he doesn’t believe there is an AI bubble. He argued that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. “AI is now profitable, meaning AIs are now so good that they deserve to be paid for,” he said. The chipmaker’s stock (NVDA) ended up nearly 5% on Tuesday. Nvidia on Tuesday said it’s releasing a blueprint for how other firms should build massive, “gigascale” AI data centers, which it calls “AI factories,” the likes of which Oracle, Microsoft, Google and other leading tech firms are investing billions in. The most powerful and efficient of those, the company says, will include Nvidia chips and software. A new Nvidia AI Factory Research Center in Virginia will use that technology. But Tuesday’s updates go far beyond data centers. Nvidia announced a partnership with telecom firms T-Mobile and Nokia to build “AI-native” 6G cell phone towers, the next generation of wireless technology. The system will use a new Nvidia product, the Aerial RAN computer, that includes its chips and software. When deployed, the technology is expected to provide a faster, more powerful connection for cell phones and a range of other AI devices, such as speakers, glasses and, eventually, robots. “Wireless technology around the world, largely today, is deployed on foreign technologies … that has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift” to 6G, Huang said. Nvidia plans to help build 100,000 self-driving cars in partnership with Uber staring in 2027 — using Nvidia’s chips and “DriveOS” autonomous vehicle operating system — so more people around the country can get rides from robotaxis. It’s providing Palantir with computing power and AI models to help companies build AI agents and systems to automate processes. Lowe’s, for example, will use the tech to create a digital replica of its global supply chain to find opportunities for greater efficiency and cost savings. With Siemens, Nvidia is releasing technology to make “digital twins” of robotic factories. Companies that use it to design, operate and monitor the work of robots doing “dangerous jobs” while helping to fill half a million manufacturing job openings, according to the chipmaker. Nvidia is also partnering with the US Department of Energy to build seven new quantum supercomputers with its AI chips to advance the agency’s scientific research. Nvidia has framed the current AI era as the next industrial revolution, but most companies that have deployed AI tools aren’t yet seeing a return on that investment, MIT said in an August report. And some of the technologies the company is betting on, such as smart glasses and self-driving cars, haven’t yet been widely adopted. The conference’s location in Washington, DC, is no accident. Huang has become a central figure in Trump’s push for the US to dominate AI, and that sentiment was on full display during the keynote — where congressional staffers were offered a special entrance. “The first thing that President Trump asked me for is (to) bring manufacturing back, bring manufacturing back because it’s necessary for national security,” Huang said, adding the company’s AI Blackwell chips are now “in full production” in Arizona, although they must be packaged (a final assembly step) abroad. Huang is set to meet with Trump in South Korea this week during the president’s visit for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Nvidia said in August it was seeking clarity from the White House on how it could restart sales of its advanced AI chips to China, after agreeing to pay the US government 15% of its China revenues earlier this year. On Tuesday, Huang said the White House has approved sales of its chips to China, but Beijing is now blocking those sales. Huang borrowed from Trump to close out his keynote: “Thank you all for your service in making America great again.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

October 28, 2025 13:51 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced America’s first AI-native wireless stack for 6G, including new applications to advance next-generation wireless technology, in collaboration with industry-leading partners Booz Allen, Cisco, MITRE, ODC and T-Mobile. As AI moves beyond smartphones to cameras, augmented-reality glasses, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices, wireless networks face mounting demand to support billions of connections at unprecedented scale and efficiency. To meet this challenge and support transformative technologies like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) — a critical sensing capability for connecting physical and digital environments — wireless networks must become AI-native across hardware, software and architecture. AI-native networks enable spectrum — radio frequencies used to transmit wireless signals — to be used as efficiently as possible. AI-RAN architecture is at the heart of next-generation wireless communications, combining connectivity, computing and sensing via a common platform with software-defined applications. “6G is being built from the ground up with AI at its core — unlocking extreme spectral efficiency, massive connectivity and breakthrough applications,” said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. “Working with industry leaders, we’ve created an AI-native wireless stack with advanced features to ensure that America will play an instrumental role in the journey to 6G.” First Made-in-America AI-Native Wireless Stack at NVIDIAJust six months since starting the AI-WIN project, NVIDIA and its partners built a complete AI-native wireless stack, performed the first user-to-user phone call over the network and developed groundbreaking 6G applications at NVIDIA’s campus in Santa Clara, California. The system combines the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform with 5G RAN software from ODC, user plane function and 5G core software from Cisco, and specialized 6G applications from MITRE and Booz Allen. Cisco is accelerating secure network connectivity for the AI era through the AI-WIN initiative, helping build the foundation to enable physical AI and integrated sensing with exceptional efficiency and security. “Through this partnership, we are pioneering the future of intelligent, secure connectivity — where AI is infused into the fabric of mobile networks and services,” said Masum Mir, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Provider Mobility. “Together, we are harnessing AI to enable networks that sense, learn and act in real time, empowering service providers to deliver high-value business and consumer services in the AI era.” Cerberus ODC’s commercial, fully software-defined 5G RAN, powered by NVIDIA AI Aerial, is setting new benchmarks by enabling simultaneous RAN and AI workloads for mission-critical enterprise applications, while outperforming legacy RAN systems with 7x greater cell capacity and 3.5x higher power efficiency. Breakthrough Applications Drive 6G StandardsAs part of the collaboration, NVIDIA and Booz Allen developed a first-of-its-kind multimodal ISAC application, fusing camera vision and radio-frequency sensing to enable precise detection and tracking of objects even in low-visibility conditions. Camera vision can be used to spot a moving object but cannot track its path or detect it when there is an obstruction. Radio-frequency sensors, however, can reveal an object’s location, velocity and distance, and sense its presence without visible light. Using camera vision and radio-frequency data, the new ISAC application delivers enhanced spatial awareness in real time, enabling powerful use cases in public safety, industrial monitoring and national security, where traditional single-modality sensing may fall short. AI-powered spectrum agility, a new application built by MITRE, manages wireless spectrum allocation within a cell site in real time so users can experience seamless connectivity and operators can benefit from dramatic improvements in spectral efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches that shut down entire network bands when interfering systems are detected, this application uses AI to target and block only the affected frequencies without interrupting consumer services. This delivers an orders-of-magnitude improvement in spectral efficiency and utilization compared with existing methods and addresses persistent challenges with spectrum management and operations. At NVIDIA GTC, Washington D.C., Booz Allen showcased its AI-powered spectrum sensing R.AI.DIO application to detect and classify any type of interference, including malicious signal jammers and unauthorized network users, in real time. This enables operators to immediately respond to threats and automatically mitigate issues to protect network integrity. NVIDIA AI Aerial software libraries make these early 6G applications possible, and new AI- and neural network-based model integrations boost performance and efficiency. In addition, the new NVIDIA Aerial Framework provides modular, programmable pipelines to seamlessly integrate third-party applications into the AI-RAN stack. Application programming interfaces that are part of the framework enable these applications to access real-time physical-layer data — the base form of data in a radio signal processing pipeline — enhancing further training and reinforcement learning for AI models on the fly. AI-native wireless networks provide the path to telecom’s major paradigm shift from 5G to 6G, enabling extremely efficient edge AI inference and sensing capabilities to serve hundreds of billions of network connections and raise revenue for operators.

Update font size. Reset Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion market value in early trading on Tuesday, becoming the third Big Tech giant to hit this milestone. Strong demand for its latest iPhone models eased concerns about the company’s lagging AI progress, which critics attribute to a lack of visionary leadership. Reuters: ‎ Apple’s shares have gained about 13% since the new launches on September 9, in a remarkable turnaround that pushed the stock into positive territory for the first time this year. Brokerage Evercore ISI expects the strong demand for Apple’s latest iPhones to help it surpass market expectations for the three-month period ending in September and issue upbeat forecasts for the quarter ending in December. Apple is the third company to hit the $4 trillion mark after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia currently tops the table with a market value of more than $4.5 trillion. Apple’s cautious approach to AI had fueled concerns it could lose out on what could be the industry’s biggest growth catalyst in decades. Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while an AI upgrade to its voice assistant Siri has been delayed until next year. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s market cap has fallen back under $4 trillion in subsequent trading.

Title: Nvidia Will Fall Apart, According to This Analyst

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 A recent analysis shows that only one Wall Street analyst rates Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a Sell. Bloomberg reports that 73 analysts have a Buy rating on the stock and another six rate it Hold. This optimism is astonishing for a stock that is up 1,426% in the past five years. The news service reports that the Nvidia bear, Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, believes “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” His belief is based on the fact that Nvidia has a small number of huge customers that make up much of its revenue. These include Microsoft and Amazon, which say they will spend tens of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence this year. That primarily includes the cost of infrastructure, which includes electricity, and the cost of Nvidia chips. solarseven / iStock via Getty Images Goldberg’s view of the future has legs. Consider what has become known as “round-tripping” of cash. Nvidia invests in a company and then gets much of that investment back in chip sales. For example, Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the industry leader. Some of that money is “recycled” to Nvidia in chip sales, AKA revenue. One decision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could stop this questionable practice. Nvidia’s top line could take a massive hit. Another argument is that AI will never be a huge commercial success. The greatest technology advance in history may produce little money. Most AI users today rely on free versions. For AI to be considered a success, companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon must make hundreds of billions of dollars on enterprise applications. It is much too early in AI’s evolution to say whether that will happen. Next, Nvidia has competition, although its bulls think those rivals will always be small. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) leads these competitors. Its stock is up 119% this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced an AI chip, and its stock rose 20% in a day. For Nvidia to keep its valuation, it must stay well ahead of these companies in revenue. Finally, there is the Chinese market. By most estimates, it is the only country close to the United States in AI development. China has blocked Nvidia chip sales, saying it has its own advanced chips, which can be improved. If Nvidia stays locked out of the market, it loses out on potentially huge sales. If Chinese chips become truly competitive, they could be direct competition to Nvidia beyond China and the U.S. Goldberg has a case.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.
