Title: The Cowboys Sold For $140 Million in 1989—They're Now Worth $12.8 Billion. Here's How That 9,000% Return Compares to Market Giants

The Dallas Cowboys topped the NFL's most valuable teams list, according to Sportico: Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million, over $370 million in today's dollars. Based on the new valuation, his investment has grown 9,042% from the initial $90 million cash outlay and $50 million loan. Several companies with the largest market capitalizations on the market today hadn't even been started in 1989—Microsoft and Apple were the only members of the eventual Magnificent Seven that existed at the time. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Google, now under parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), had not yet been founded. Here's a look at how the Cowboys' 9,000% gain compares to the return some of the most important stocks today, like Microsoft and Apple, have delivered since February 1989, along with how some of the companies with the largest market caps at the time have performed since. When applicable, stock prices have been adjusted to account for stock splits that have taken place in the decades since. Jerry Jones turned a $140 million bet on the Dallas Cowboys in 1989 into a $12.8 billion empire—one of the most lucrative investments in sports history. His 9,000% return rivals the long-term gains of giants like Walmart and Berkshire Hathaway, but is still dwarfed by the explosive gains of tech titans such as Microsoft and Apple.

US stock markets opened Friday on a turbulent note as investors weighed strong corporate moves against persistent inflation pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record intraday high of 45,203.52, fueled by gains in healthcare stocks. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped to 21,710.67, dragged down by profit-taking in tech and cautious semiconductor forecasts. The spotlight was on UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped over 11% after Warren Buffett’s $1.57 billion stake was disclosed, signaling renewed investor confidence. Traders also digested July’s 0.9% jump in the Producer Price Index (PPI), keeping Treasury yields elevated and adding pressure on growth-oriented stocks.

Title: [Update] NVIDIA’s Rubin AI Architecture Is On Track As Team Green Sticks To Its Annual Cadence, Tackling AMD’s Instinct Series With A Generational Lead

[Update - 8/14/25] - NVIDIA's Rubin architecture and respective GPUs remain on track as part of the company's annual cadence. [Original Post / Debunked] NVIDIA's next-gen Rubin lineup might be delayed by at least a few months, as Team Green is redesigning the lineup to give AMD a tougher competition. The next-gen AI hardware segment is expected to see many changes in terms of the shift in market share from NVIDIA to AMD. Both firms are battling fiercely to bring superior equipment out there; however, NVIDIA seems to see the competition ramping up unexpectedly, which is why the firm is looking for a Rubin redesign. Based on a report by the Fubon Research, which is part of one of the largest banks in Taiwan, it is claimed that Rubin will have limited volume in 2026, marking a delay of approximately four to six months. 1) Rubin redesign leads to more limited volume2) TSMC CoWoS capacity to hit 130k in 20273) Blackwell Volume: 750k in Q1 25, 1.2mn in Q2, 1.5mn in Q3, 1.6mn in Q44) Broadcom is fastest growing CoWoS customer in 2026Source: Fubon$tsm $nvda $avgo pic.twitter.com/ckoZswOCkI While the specifics of a redesign are uncertain for now, NVIDIA's decision is reportedly based on AMD's Instinct MI450 AI lineup. The latter is claimed to debut with IF64 and IF128 configurations, competing with Vera Rubin. More importantly, AMD is claimed to go heavy on HBM capacity, reportedly featuring up to 432 GB per GPU. Hence, NVIDIA might target newer Rubin configurations, but this is just an estimate for now. Moreover, AMD relies on design modularity through the use of Infinity Fabric over Ethernet, which allows for easier rack deployment. It is claimed that the Rubin redesign will limit the shipment volume of the next-gen architecture in 2026, similar to what is happening now with Blackwell Ultra. Eventually, that timeline would be right in time for MI450 to debut in the market, which means Rubin Ultra might get pushed ahead as well. While the reason for Rubin's delay isn't specific, our estimate does indicate that NVIDIA's vigorous product cycle might have caused issues for the firm, and we have discussed this aspect in depth here.

August 13, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: Themes ETF Trust Themes ETF Trust *The Fund has characteristics unlike many other traditional investment products and may not be suitable for all investors. For more information regarding whether an investment in the Fund is right for you, please see the prospectus for more information. **An investor who buys Fund shares after the start of an Outcome Period or who sells shares before the end of an Outcome Period may not fully realize the Accelerated Return and may be exposed to greater losses than that of the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. GREENWICH, Conn., Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leverage Shares by Themes is excited to announce the launch of a new category of single stock leveraged ETFs called the Capped Accelerated series, available for trading starting August 13, 2025. These products are designed to equip investors to amplify up to 200% of the monthly returns of the underlying stock up to a cap, while limiting downside risk to approximately 100% of the underlying stock’s returns. The new ETFs use an options-based strategy to increase return potential for the calendar month period, while limiting the downside to the actual movement of the underlying stock. Simply put: Tailored to target a 200% exposure to the monthly performance of their underlying stocks up to a stated cap and reset on the calendar month, this new series aims to offer sophisticated traders and the retail investors an efficient tool to capitalize on potential amplified returns to upside, without increasing the downside risk if the stock prices move lower. The five new ETFS will be set at a management fee of .75%. The new ETFs are: “The biggest criticism from skeptics regarding Single Stock Leveraged ETFs is that they can potentially be too risky for retail traders who don’t incorporate proper risk management,” said Chief Revenue Officer of Themes ETFs Paul Marino. “We believe this new Capped Accelerated series finally offers investors the potential for amplified returns up, without amplifying losses on the downside.” As part of the Leverage Shares by Themes offering, this new series targets prominent companies at the forefront of AI, digital assets and technological transformation: COIO: This ETF tracks Coinbase (COIN), a leading US-based crypto exchange. As crypto adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves, Coinbase remains a critical on-ramp to the digital asset economy. MSOO: Offering monthly leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy (MSTR), this ETF taps into the dual narrative of enterprise intelligence and Bitcoin accumulation. As one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy offers a hybrid play on business analytics and digital asset appreciation. NVDO: Nvidia (NVDA) sits at the heart of exponential tech growth. With Nvidia powering the infrastructure behind AI, gaming, and data centers, this ETF provides leveraged exposure to a titan behind next-gen computing. PLOO: This ETF targets Palantir (PLTR), a software company pioneering the use of AI and big data analytics in government and commercial sectors. With growing demand for its AI Platform (AIP), Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on data-driven transformation across industries. TSLO: As Tesla (TSLA) expands its influence across EVs, battery storage, and AI-drive automation, investors can use this ETF to target amplified performance of a global leader redefining global transportation and energy systems.

Funds listed above (each, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”) seek to provide the following pre-determined outcomes (the “Outcomes”) for an investment that is held for an entire Outcome Period: (1) the Accelerated Return, which is based on the upside share price return of an underlying security (the “Underlying Stock”) and is subject to the Approximate Cap, and (2) approximately the same downside performance of the Underlying Stock. Please see below for the definitions of key terms. The Fund seeks to provide certain pre-determined outcomes (the “Outcomes”) based on the performance of the share price of the underlying stock for investors who hold Fund shares over a full calendar month (the “Outcome Period”). The Outcomes sought by the Fund are: The Funds have characteristics unlike many investment products and may not be appropriate for all investors. The Outcomes sought by the Funds’ strategies are not guaranteed. The Accelerated Return and the Approximate Cap may not operate as anticipated, and investors may lose some or all of their money. The Outcomes apply only to shares that are held for an entire Outcome Period. An investor who buys Fund shares after the start of an Outcome Period or who sells shares before the end of an Outcome Period may not fully realize the Accelerated Return and may be exposed to greater losses than that of the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. The Fund does not provide a buffer against losses experienced by the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. The Approximate Cap is provided prior to taking into account any fees or expenses charged to the Fund or shareholder transaction fees. Fees and any expenses will reduce the Approximate Cap amount for Fund shareholders for an Outcome Period. The Approximate Cap will likely change for each Outcome Period and will be announced at the start of each Outcome Period. Visit the Fund’s page on leverageshares.com/us/ for information about the start date and end date of the current Outcome Period, the Approximate Cap for the current Outcome Period and the potential outcomes of an investment in the Funds, including the remaining Approximate Cap. Investment involves significant risk. Fund does not invest directly in the underlying stock. As with any investment, there is a risk that you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Fund. COIO, MSTO, NVDO, PLTO, and TSLO are designed to provide investors with amplified returns (up and down) on innovative companies in the technology sector. The Funds are newly launched and have risks associated with a limited operating history. The Funds are not suitable for all investors. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking monthly leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Funds are not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than one month, the Funds will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than one month. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within the one-month holding period. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), the Adviser has agreed to pay all expenses of the Fund, except for the fee paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, interest charges on any borrowings, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenses incurred in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities and other investment instruments, acquired fund fees and expenses, accrued deferred tax liability, extraordinary expenses, and distribution (12b-1) fees and expenses. PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns.
