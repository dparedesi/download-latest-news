Title: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's $2B AI Startup Thinking Machines Lab Sets $50M Investment Minimum, Backed By Andreessen Horowitz And Sequoia Capital

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Mira Murati, the former chief technology officer of OpenAI and a central figure behind ChatGPT, is launching her own AI startup, and she’s doing it in blockbuster fashion. Thinking Machines Lab, the AI company founded by Murati early this year, is raising a $2 billion seed round at a $10 billion valuation. According to Business Insider, the round is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, with support from Sequoia Capital and other top-tier investors. Those interested in backing the venture are being asked to commit a minimum of $50 million per check, a staggering requirement for what would be one of the largest seed rounds in startup history. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The startup's ambition is to reshape the way artificial intelligence is built and understood. According to the company’s website, Thinking Machines Lab will focus on making AI “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable,” highlighting a shift toward both transparency and user control. That positioning places the company in direct conceptual competition with AI giants like OpenAI, Google's Gemini, Elon Musk's xAI, and Anthropic, which are all currently racing to define the next generation of large language models and autonomous systems, Business Insider reported. Murati spent more than six years at OpenAI, contributing to the development of ChatGPT and other advanced AI research projects. According to Business Insider, she was briefly appointed interim CEO in November 2023, after the board unexpectedly removed Sam Altman, a decision that triggered internal upheaval across the company. Following Altman's reinstatement just days later, Murati returned to her position as chief technology officer.

Andreessen Horowitz, the legendary venture capital firm that previously backed Facebook and Airbnb ABNB, Financial Times reported, is leading the round alongside Sequoia Capital, known for its investments in Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and WhatsApp, Fortune says. Their involvement may signal strong institutional belief in Murati's long-term potential. Thinking Machines Lab is also assembling a brain trust of former OpenAI engineers and scientists. According to The Founders Magazine, team members include Bob McGrew, former head of research at OpenAI, Alec Radford, one of the minds behind the original GPT, Barret Zoph, a top researcher on ChatGPT, and John Schulman, co-lead of the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technique that powers modern AI safety. See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Few early-stage startups command minimum investments in the tens of millions. According to Business Insider, Murati’s $50 million threshold is a practical necessity since training large models and building scalable infrastructure requires capital on a massive scale. If the raise closes as expected, Thinking Machines Lab will stand beside OpenAI and Anthropic as one of the most well-capitalized AI startups in the world, Business Insider says, and one of the only ones led by a woman. With technical vision, elite backing, and a mission to open up the black box of AI, Murati's next chapter may reshape the way the world builds and interacts with intelligent systems.

Title: Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/10/nvidia-stock-at-40-safety/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. At about $117 a share, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still trading about 15% below its all-time highs seen in January 2025. Revenues grew more than 110% over the last year, while net profit margins exceeded 50%. With artificial intelligence tunes playing everywhere, do you think Nvidia stock is a good long-term bet at current levels? What about at a 30% discount at about $82 per share? Now we’re talking. So if you think $82 per share for the AI poster-child is a steal, and have some cash ready to go, here’s a clever trade. The Trade: 12% yield at 30% margin of safety, by selling Put Options NVDA stock is trading at about $117. You can sell a long-dated Put option expiring June 18, 2026, with a strike price of $82, and collect roughly $680 in premium per contract (each contract represents 100 shares). That’s about an 8.3% yield on the $8,200 you’re setting aside for the possibility of buying the stock. Plus, don’t forget, this cash parked in a savings or money market account will earn an extra 4%. So we’re talking >12% yield overall. Separately, see Tesla Stock To $1,500 And here’s the kicker. You're agreeing to buy Nvidia at $82, a roughly 30% discount to the current market price, only if the stock drops below that level by the expiration date. Think that’s too risky? Want a higher margin of safety - for example 40%? Use a $70 strike instead of $82 strike - your overall earnings will still be an impressive 9% instead of 12%, and you’ll enjoy more peace. The strategy is reliable because large institutions have tested the strategy at scale, and for the right long-term investors, may serve just right. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Sure, I see the 12% return, however, what if Nvidia drops more than 30%, isn’t there some risk? Of course, there is risk. Because, there are two ways this could unfold: In short, you win either way, especially if you're comfortable owning a quality company like Nvidia for the long haul. Is that a good deal though? It could very well be, if you consider three facts -- If you do end up owning NVDA stock, you’re not stuck with some speculative small-cap stock. You're holding a company that is: And The Risk of a Crash Is Lower Than You Think Selling puts is only as good as the business you’re willing to own. With Nvidia, that bar is high. Here’s why: The Bottom Line - Margin of Safety This trade offers an asymmetric risk-reward setup, with a built-in 30% discount. Either way, you come out ahead. These are the kinds of margin-of-safety setups and asymmetric risk-reward tradeoffs that we seek in the Trefis HQ portfolio, which is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Genocide, Blood, and Dividends

Time Published: 2025-05-09T22:00:48Z

By Adam Sharp PostedMay 9, 2025 In the 1987 film Wall Street, Michael Douglas famously played Gordon Gekko, a cutthroat corporate raider. But compared to the Dutch pioneers who founded the world’s first publicly-traded company, Gordon Gekko was a softie. Those Dutch guys were literally cutting throats in pursuit of profit. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the century the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Oh yeah, along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering (IPO), giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders. Without the VOC, we might not have today’s efficient and lucrative stock markets.

The U.S. government plans to withdraw a rule introduced under the Biden administration that had aimed to restrict exports of advanced AI chips — a policy that had posed challenges for major semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) and AMD (AMD+0.47%). “The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic and would stymie American innovation,” a spokeswoman from the Commerce Department said in a statement. The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios. The regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China. Chipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland. The shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively. But any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market. Nvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions. Last month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
