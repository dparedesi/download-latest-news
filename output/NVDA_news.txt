Title: Disaster Ensues After AI Behemoth Floats Idea Of Stealing Your Tax Dollars If They Fail

AI behemoth OpenAI tried to lay the groundwork for a taxpayer-funded bailout Wednesday and was met with swift condemnation. The Wall Street Journal published a story Sunday suggesting that OpenAI has now become “too big to fail.” In other words, if the company were to go under, it would be such a blow to the U.S. economy that the government would have to intervene and save it; otherwise, there might be a spiraling drain effect that sucks down the entire system. A domino effect from hell. OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, seemed to test-pilot the idea at a Wall Street Journal conference Wednesday, saying that the company wants to build up an ecosystem of banks, private equity groups, and a federal government “backstop” or “guarantee” to help build and finance the crucial data centers. (RELATED: Battle Against Data Centers Driving Up Electric Bills Unites Republicans, Democrats) There was swift backlash on social media, however, which forced OpenAI to do some cleanup. Friar later clarified her comment, saying that the mention of a “backdrop” muddied her point that “American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.” OpenAI wants federal taxpayer backstop for new investments, per Bloomberg. CFO has clarified this was a “misspeak.” — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) November 6, 2025 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a long statement Thursday on X, claiming they are not looking for “government guarantees,” or a handout from Uncle Sam. I would like to clarify a few things. First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or… — Sam Altman (@sama) November 6, 2025 “First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work,” he said. Sam just wrote a 1,500-word essay explaining why he absolutely doesn’t want government guarantees… while outlining a $1.4 trillion moonshot that somehow needs them in spirit, if not on paper. It’s performance art at this point. 😂 He’s basically saying: “We don’t want… — Void Freud (@voidfreud) November 6, 2025 Altman went on to say that OpenAI has discussed government-subsidized loans to help build semiconductor factories in the U.S. “The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply),” Altman said. “The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts,” he goes on. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks joined the mop-up, as well. (Sacks is essentially Silicon Valley’s lobbying voice in the Trump White House.) There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025 But, if there were a real market meltdown soon, why should we take these people’s statements that they don’t want a guaranteed federal bailout as true at face value? Clearly, they have been mulling over the idea. And it would be much easier to finance a mass buildout of data centers if investors knew that the federal government and taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill. In other words, if they knew the risk and downside of the whole AI bubble blowing up in their faces was passed on to the public. Altman recently got snappy when Brad Gerstner, an American investor, dared to ask him how OpenAI is going to pay for $1.4 trillion of long-term spending commitments on hardware and data center infrastructure from 2025-2035, even though the company’s revenue still is middling. “First of all. We’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough. I think there’s a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell your shares or anybody else’s to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman claimed. Of course, the “people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this” just seem to be those with common sense, an ability to do basic math, and a growing skepticism that AI technology will actually be worth the investment. One MIT study found that 95% of organizations that have tried to implement generative AI, like OpenAI’s technology, ChatGPT, got zero in return. Another study from the Rand Corporation revealed that 80% of AI implementations fail. All of it is beginning to reek of … ‘Just give me more money, and this time, there will be a major breakthrough, and it will all be worth it. The best is yet to come!’ I don’t know exactly how many times Altman and other tech CEOs have said something to this effect over the years, but I know it’s more than once. And something of note: the famous investor who shorted the U.S. housing market ahead of the 08/09 financial crisis, Michael Burry, now has a short position on tech behemoths Palantir and Nvidia. He’s betting that these stocks are overvalued and will soon crash. 🚨 BREAKING: Michael Burry goes short on $PLTR and $NVDA in his latest 13F filing Scion Capital just bought put options on 1M Nvidia shares and 5M Palantir shares 👀 The Big Short is feeling bearish on AI pic.twitter.com/Kn6EcINm20 — Michael Burry Stock Tracker ♟ (@burrytracker) November 3, 2025 News of the trade sparked a big selloff in tech, as speculation that AI is a bubble ready to burst is running rampant. That might explain why OpenAI tried to float the idea of the federal government and taxpayers funding their infrastructure. Sign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

Title: OpenAI’s Government Lifeline: A $1T Ask Amid Wall Street’s AI Doubts

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI has reportedly requested U.S. government loan guarantees to support what could become one of the largest private infrastructure buildouts in history, an AI expansion valued at more than $ 1 trillion. The plan also aligns with OpenAI’s broader effort to reduce its dependence on Nvidia’s costly GPU ecosystem, as it explores alternative financing and chip-sourcing strategies to sustain its trillion-dollar expansion into large-scale AI infrastructure. The timing is notable. While OpenAI seeks federal backing, segments of Wall Street are growing cautious about the sustainability of the AI rally. Hedge fund manager Michael Burry has reportedly taken substantial put positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting on a correction in overextended AI equities. Meanwhile, banks such as Deutsche Bank are exploring hedges against their data-center exposure, anticipating a possible cooling period in AI infrastructure spending. It marks a clear divergence between Silicon Valley’s aggressive capital expansion and Wall Street’s tightening risk appetite—a contrast that could define the next phase of the AI investment cycle. Since its launch, OpenAI has attracted substantial private and corporate investment, led by its deep partnership with Microsoft. That backing has helped fuel its rapid expansion in both research and cloud-based AI services. Now, however, the company’s ambitions extend beyond traditional venture and corporate funding. OpenAI is pursuing federal loan guarantees, effectively positioning its AI infrastructure strategy as a public-private partnership. The move would shift part of the financial burden and risk of scaling artificial intelligence from private investors to the U.S. government, marking a significant evolution in how frontier technology projects are financed. At a recent conference, CFO Sarah Friar said the company is building “an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” participants. In a typical scenario, technology companies raise debt through private markets, paying interest rates that reflect their credit risk. OpenAI’s proposal departs from that model. By seeking a federal loan guarantee, the company would transfer much of the default risk from lenders to the U.S. government. This backing would allow OpenAI to borrow at significantly lower rates and negotiate higher loan-to-value terms, reducing the overall cost of capital for its ambitious infrastructure plans. According to OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, government participation could “materially lower the cost of financing” while broadening the base of lenders willing to fund the project. For policymakers and taxpayers, the optics are complicated. A private technology firm seeking state-backed financing to build infrastructure that could accelerate automation (and potentially displace jobs) poses a political and ethical dilemma. Analysts have compared OpenAI’s proposal to historical frameworks, such as the Defense Production Act and Department of Energy loan programs, which supported the early electric vehicle and solar sectors. The difference this time lies in the asset class: AI infrastructure, not physical manufacturing. If the plan proceeds, the financial risk would be borne by the public, rather than the venture capital community that traditionally funds frontier technology. By tying its AI build-out to federal support, OpenAI is effectively redefining the boundary between public and private investment in computing infrastructure, hinting at a state–Silicon Valley hybrid model for the next era of technological expansion. In recent filings and market moves, the relentless AI bull run is starting to show visible signs of losing steam. Two very different actors are showing varying degrees of scepticism about the AI boom’s outlook: one a famed contrarian investor, and the other a multinational bank with significant exposure to the hardware boom. According to Scion Asset Management’s Q3 2025 13F filing, hedge fund manager Michael Burry has taken substantial put option positions against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), with a combined notional value of roughly $1.1 billion. These bearish bets account for approximately 80% of Scion’s disclosed U.S. equity portfolio, indicating a strong conviction that the current AI rally may have extended beyond its fundamentals. Burry’s positioning suggests he expects a significant correction in both AI hardware and software valuations, a contrarian view amid the sector’s explosive growth. However, it’s worth noting that 13F filings don’t include cash or foreign holdings, meaning Scion could be holding sizable reserves outside of its reported U.S. equity positions. Still, Burry’s track record invites caution in interpretation. His legendary short against the U.S. housing market in 2008 proved highly profitable but was long-dated and capital-intensive, requiring substantial collateral to maintain open positions. More recently, in 2023, Burry expressed a bearish outlook on social media platform X just before a major market rebound, a call he quietly deleted afterward. The takeaway? Undoubtedly, there is a risk that the AI bubble could pop. However, timing it correctly is the risky part; the market may well run a lot higher before a meaningful downturn. On a different front, Deutsche Bank is quietly rebalancing its exposure. The bank is reportedly exploring hedges and short baskets targeting AI-linked stocks and data center debt, as it evaluates its exposure to multibillion-dollar financing for compute infrastructure. With lenders themselves beginning to hedge their bets, the frenzy that only recently dominated AI investment may be beginning to morph into something more measured and cautious. OpenAI’s request for government-backed loan guarantees raises questions that go far beyond corporate finance. If Washington agrees to underwrite even a portion of a $1 trillion AI infrastructure plan, it would mark a defining shift for the industry, the point at which advanced computing transitions from a private enterprise to a state-subsidized utility. Economists warn that data centers and GPUs depreciate significantly faster than traditional infrastructure, creating a mismatch between the short lifespan of these assets and the long-term liabilities that taxpayers may be asked to support. Supporters counter that such a partnership could represent a digital-era form of industrial policy, ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and artificial general intelligence before global competitors, particularly China and emerging state-backed players in the Middle East, can scale comparable systems. The push reflects not just the scale of infrastructure but also a shift in how AI is delivered, from strictly enterprise systems to increasingly personalized, user-facing models that are being tailored for everyday interaction, featuring modular personalities and adult-mode customization. Critics, however, see a familiar pattern emerging: socialized risk and privatized rewards. Either way, the proposal forces a deeper question for the decade ahead — can the AI revolution sustain itself on private capital alone, or has it already grown too big to fail?

Title: Here's How Hot Quantum Stocks Have Been Lately—And What to Know About Them

Move over, AI. Quantum computing stocks—those representing a technology that teases vast computing power—have soared in the past year, making even the artificial-intelligence rally look tame. Shares of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) have soared 2,700% and 3,100%, respectively, over that period. Quantum Computing (QUBT) is up 1,100%. IonQ (IONQ), up 250%, is the laggard of the bunch. Only a few of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks have posted comparable gains in the past 12 months. Software companies Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), lauded for their AI-driven growth, have risen roughly 300% in the past year. Nvidia (NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, has gained about 44%. Rallies typically slow with age, so it's understandable that the fresher theme has more momentum behind it—particularly at a time when investors have been willing to lean into speculative concepts and companies. But compare quantum stocks over the past year and AI stocks in the year after ChatGPT was released, and quantum still dramatically outpaces AI: Nvidia shares rose 206% in the 12 months starting Nov. 30, 2022, while server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) soared 212%. Everyday investors often fear they're missing out when they see asset prices skyrocketing the way quantum computing stocks have. That fear can drive investors to make risky bets on poorly understood stocks that they panic sell at a loss when the rally hits a rough patch. Granted, Wall Street didn’t immediately grasp how significant ChatGPT would be for Nvidia, and the chipmaker’s stock gains accelerated in 2023. But even in the yearlong period that Nvidia rose the fastest—between March 2023 and March 2024—its approximately 300% return still pales in comparison to most quantum stocks in the last 12 months. A string of technological breakthroughs and Big Tech investments has raised quantum computing’s visibility on Wall Street over the past year. Last December, Google (GOOG) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that it claims can solve a problem in 5 minutes that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years to complete. (That’s 714 trillion times the estimated age of the universe.) Microsoft (MSFT) debuted its own quantum chip in February, and Nvidia last month unveiled hardware designed specifically to connect quantum computers and the accelerated computing chips that power AI. As with the early days of the AI rally, quantum investors are betting the nascent technology will have profound implications for the economy and business. Quantum computing is expected to drive advancements in drug discovery, advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, financial modeling, and logistics, to name just a few of its possible commercial applications. Due to the speculative nature of quantum investments, the stocks swing dramatically on the slightest shift in sentiment. Shares of Rigetti plummeted 45% one day in January when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he believed a “very useful” quantum computer was still about 20 years out. Quantum stocks, despite their recent run-up, are relatively small compared with AI darlings. The four aforementioned companies have market capitalizations ranging from $2.5 billion (D-Wave Quantum) to $18.5 billion (IonQ)—valuations that are by no means small, but which are dwarfed by Nvidia's $5 trillion market cap. Another factor driving the stocks higher in recent months: the Trump administration's hands-on approach to public-private partnerships. The Wall Street Journal recently reported the White House was in talks to invest in several quantum computing companies. The Trump administration, which has struck similar deals with chipmaker Intel (INTC) and rare earths miners, denied the reports, but that didn't stop quantum stocks from soaring. Huang’s 20-year quantum timeline may be one of the most pessimistic forecasts out there, but the technology does face hurdles to commercialization. Quantum computers are too error-prone to achieve “quantum advantage"—the point at which a quantum computer can solve a real-world problem faster than a classical computer—according to a recent Bank of America report. Last month, IonQ announced it had achieved fidelity—a measure of computational accuracy—of 99.99%, a record for quantum computers that essentially means the computer would make one mistake for every 10,000 computations. But the binary computers we use today boast much higher fidelity, making a mistake in one out of every 10 quintillion computations, according to BofA. To achieve “quantum advantage,” BofA estimates quantum will need to reach fidelity of 99.9999%. And it may be difficult to integrate quantum computers with existing digital infrastructure like data centers and software, according to BofA. Nonetheless, consulting firm McKinsey estimates the quantum computing market could reach $97 billion by 2035, and nearly $200 billion by 2040. And monetization by leading technology companies may not be that far off: Bank of America analysts in a note last month said they expect quantum computing to have a material impact on computing pioneer IBM’s (IBM) results by 2030.

Title: DayTrading.com's Head Analyst Issues Warning That US Stock Market Is Priced For Impossible Perfection

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: Is Bitcoin’s price dip a ‘buy signal’ for long-term BTC investors?

Social sentiment crashes while on-chain data stays strong. BTC’s Social Sentiment hit its third most bearish reading in six months, signaling rising fear despite steady fundamentals. Not necessarily. Experts say the 20% dip could be a buying opportunity. Bitcoin’s [BTC] mood turned darker than its data. Social Sentiment just hit its third most bearish reading in six months, at a moment when the fundamentals aren’t actually breaking. Instead, BTC remained near historic relative lows against Apple [AAPL] and NVIDIA [NVDA], and the on-chain base case still looks firm. It feels like sentiment pricing in stress that the network itself isn’t showing yet. Crypto Analyst Nic Puckrin, Co-Founder of The Coin Bureau, told AMBCrypto, “Bitcoin under $100,000 tends to fill crypto investors with an almost biblical level of dread. It’s worth remembering that despite the recent sell-off, BTC is currently only around 20% below its all-time high. This is crypto, not the bond market, so a 20% drop is often just a buying signal.” Source: Santiment Bitcoin’s drop coincided with one of the most bearish comment ratios in six months, yet crowd behavior revealed a twist. Santiment data showed the highest level of Negative Words in eight months, even as “buy” mentions stayed elevated. Similar setups, like in late October, preceded short-term recoveries. Source: Santiment The latest data showed extreme negativity paired with active buy mentions. BTC may be near another local sentiment-driven inflection point. Source: X The crypto market’s $1 trillion drawdown since January was a massive leverage reset. Open interest collapsed over 40% after peaking near record highs, as hundreds of thousands of traders were liquidated daily. But adoption never slowed. User counts jumped to 560 million, stablecoins now handle 30% of transactions, and institutional participation via ETFs and reserves keeps expanding. While prices fell from $3.66 trillion peak to $2.65 trillion, fundamentals strengthened. The market is rebuilding from forced liquidation. That disconnect between fear and fundamentals is also showing up beyond crypto charts, too. Source: X BTC/NVIDIA touched the bottom of its long-term channel, a level that has triggered reversals where Bitcoin went on to outperform NVIDIA’s stock. Similarly, BTC/APPLE stayed inside a clean multi-year structure, cooling off after its July 2025 peak. Source: X Together, this could mean a rotation of capital back into BTC as tech momentum cools. This is a setup that’s repeatedly meant the start of new strength cycles for Bitcoin. About BTC’s current state, Puckrin said, “While I don’t believe this sell-off marks the end of Bitcoin’s bull market, this point is drawing nearer, and that means the swings are getting wilder.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Advanced Micro Devices investors have become harder to impress. The chipmaker yesterday posted record quarterly results and an upbeat outlook on surging demand for its data center chips—and its stock has hardly budged. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up about 2%, near $255, in recent trading as the broader tech sector looked to rebound from yesterday's sell-off. Here's a roundup of what Wall Street analysts said about AMD after last night's results. This year's big stock gains for chipmakers like AMD have given rise to worries about an AI bubble. The weak reaction to AMD's strong results could underscore growing uncertainty around the sector—or, at least, the rich valuations carried by stocks in it. Analysts at Oppenheimer, who maintained a neutral rating, voiced some concerns about AMD's reputation as a "second horse supplier" to AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), preferring to stay on the sidelines while waiting to see more from AMD's ability to compete with its AI strategy. Most Wall Street analysts, however, remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock amid expectations of growing market share for AMD. Jefferies and HSBC analysts, who have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock and $300 price targets, said they came away from Tuesday's results convinced of AMD's potential for more AI-driven growth. HSBC called AMD's recent deal with OpenAI a "game changing" development. Wedbush, which boosted its target to $290 from $270, said it is looking forward to an Analyst Day event next Tuesday for more color on its roadmap. While Wall Street's targets and ratings may be in flux, the mean price target on AMD's shares is around $275 based on Visible Alpha data and Investopedia calculations. About twice as many analysts have "buy" ratings as have "holds," with no bearish ratings currently tracked by the service. Shares of AMD have more than doubled in 2025 so far, with much of its recent gains coming in the wake of the OpenAI deal announced last month.
