Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Tells Joe Rogan AI Race Is Real, But It Won’t Have a Clear Winner

Time Published: 2025-12-03T20:08:28Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t think the artificial intelligence race will be decided in a single breakthrough. On The Joe Rogan Experience, Huang cast AI’s acceleration as the latest chapter in a long-running global competition for technological advantage, one that has repeatedly redrawn geopolitical lines, from World War II through the Cold War. “We’ve always been in a tech race with someone,” Huang said, likening today’s push for AI leadership to the Manhattan Project. The difference, he argued, is tempo: rather than a sudden, decisive finish line, AI will advance in waves, continuous gains that are easy to miss in the moment but obvious in hindsight. That doesn’t mean the stakes are modest, according to the CEO of one of the biggest manufacturers of the the chips AI firms need to operate. Huang said AI systems have become roughly 100 times more capable over the last two years, a rate of progress that has fueled public anxiety about autonomous weapons and machines operating beyond human moral constraints. Huang’s counterpoint: much of the momentum is flowing into functionality and safety, making systems more reliable, more useful and less error-prone, he claimed. He also defended the U.S. military’s role in AI development, suggesting that defense involvement can normalize the technology’s place in national security rather than leaving it to shadowy, unaccountable actors. Rogan pressed on a familiar set of fears: AI outpacing human judgment, and the longer-term threat that quantum computing could crack modern encryption. Huang pushed back, arguing that AI will remain “a click ahead," and that history is full of moments when society panicked over its newest inventions, only to adapt once the technology became legible and regulated. If Huang has an ideal end state, it’s not a single winner hoisting a trophy. It’s something quieter: AI becoming infrastructure, fading into the background as it powers everyday systems, from healthcare to transportation, less a conquering intelligence than a new layer of computing people stop noticing because it simply works.

Title: We Might Finally Get Some Big AI IPOs—Which Would Mean a Look at Their Financials
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/we-might-finally-get-some-big-ai-ipos-and-a-look-at-their-financials-anthropic-openai-11861238
Time Published: 2025-12-03T19:00:41Z
Full Content:
Here come the big AI IPOs. (Maybe.) Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot, is preparing for an initial public offering that could come next year, according to the Financial Times. The company is also said to be in talks to raise funding that would push its valuation over $300 billion. The report followed others saying OpenAI, the company behind rival ChatGPT, is also getting ready for an IPO that could drive its valuation to $1 trillion. Spokespeople for both Anthropic and OpenAI denied having set plans for an IPO in those reports. The first of these companies to reach public markets will set the bar for the rest—and open up the AI-investment landscape beyond the biggest publicly traded tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META), whose stock valuations have lately stoked concerns of bubble-ish excesses. It would also give the masses a good look at the economics of AI language-model developers. Elon Musk's xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot, in late November was said to be preparing to close a $15 billion fundraising round in December, pushing its pre-money valuation to $230 billion. The most well-known AI frontier startups—companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Databricks, Perplexity and xAI—are private. One going public could prompt others to follow, which would open up the AI investment landscape beyond the chipmakers and Big Tech companies that investors have poured dollars into. IPO documents, particularly those called S-1 filings, are rich sources of information, because companies are legally bound to give public-market investors a thorough look at the business before they raise funds from them. The big reveal is in the financials—what revenue growth looks like, profit margins, and how much cash companies are burning to develop new products, the latter of which has been a source of AI investor angst. They'll also show companies' cap tables, detailing their ownership structure. Filings from Anthropic or OpenAI would adress a lot of investor questions about the state of frontier AI development. Meanwhile, private markets are flush with AI startups. The sector has drawn roughly 65% of venture capital investments in 2025 through the third quarter, according a PitchBook's report published this week. Though that figure is skewed by the multibillion-dollar fundraising rounds of a few big startups, it also shows how ubiquitous such startups have become. "No other emerging technology has accounted for a larger share of total deal activity," PitchBook director of research Kyle Stanford and his team wrote in the report. The old high-water mark was in early 2013, when mobile accounted for roughly 20% of deal counts; AI accounts for 35% currently. That could make for an exciting pipeline of coming IPOs if one AI startup unlocks the floodgates to public markets. But it could also fuel Dotcom bubble comparisons.

Stock futures are slightly higher and bitcoin is rising as the market looks to add to yesterday's gains; AI company Anthropic is reportedly considering an initial public offering; Apple is expected to post its best year of iPhone sales thanks to strong demand in China; shares of Marvell Technology are soaring after the chip company reported strong earnings; and American Eagle stock is surging after the retailer said its performance got a boost from its affiliations with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open this morning as the market looks to gain ground for the second straight session after having a week-long winning streak snapped on Monday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq were up 0.2% recently. The major indexes posted solid gains on Tuesday as tech stocks rallied and bitcoin rebounded from a recent sell-off. Bitcoin was trading at $93,000 recently, up from an overnight low of around $91,000 and a low on Monday below $84,000. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,245 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 1.3% to $59.40 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.06%, down from 4.09% at yesterday's close. AI company Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and the maker of the Claude chatbot, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering the Financial Times reported. The company is reportedly working with a high-profile IPO law firm, and is in preliminary talks with banks to gauge interest. Anthropic is also considering raising more funding privately, with a new round that could include $15 billion from AI heavyweights Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and would value Anthropic at over $300 billion. AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI have commanded tremendous amounts of money from the private capital markets in recent years, but few purely AI companies are on the stock market today. Reports have also suggested that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is considering an IPO, but not in the immediate future, according to CNBC. Going public would require more financial disclosures than OpenAI and Anthropic are required to provide as private companies, and test how prepared investors are to put money into AI chatbot makers that have been burning through tens of billions in recent years with an unclear path to profitability. Apple (AAPL) is expected to post a record number of smartphone shipments globally in 2025 thanks to the success of its iPhone 17 model, according to data released by International Data Corporation. IDC estimates that Apple shipments will surpass 247 million units this year, a 6.1% increase from the year before. Huge demand in China is primarily responsible for the surge. IDC projects that Apple's China sales for the fourth quarter will be 17% higher than a year ago, while sales growth for the full year will be up 3%, both well above previous projections. IDC expects the global smartphone market to contract by 0.9% in 2026 owing to a shortage of memory components. Also, Apple reportedly has considered moving the iPhone 18 launch to early 2027 rather than its typical fall announcement and release window. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) are soaring in premarket trading after the semiconductor manufacturer topped profit estimates and announced a $3.25 billion acquisition. Marvell posted earnings in its fiscal 2026 third quarter of 76 cents per share, slightly topping the Wall Street consensus, while revenue of $2.07 billion matched analysts' estimates. Meanwhile, Marvell announced a deal to acquire Celestial AI, whose technology Marvell says can help make the servers inside the data centers that train and run AI models more efficient. Marvell expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, with Celestial AI meaningfully contributing to revenue by the back half of fiscal 2028. Marvell stock, which through yesterday's close was down 16% since the start of the year, rose more than 10% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are surging after the clothing retailer posted strong results and raised its outlook. The clothing retailer behind its namesake brand and others including Aerie said Tuesday it generated $1.36 billion in revenue in the third quarter, along with earnings per share of $0.53. Each was higher than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Comparable store sales rose 4% across the whole company. American Eagle lifted its forecasts for sales growth and operating income for the fourth quarter. In its earnings call, CEO Jay Schottenstein called out the company's recent marketing partnerships with celebrities such as actress Sydney Sweeney and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, saying they delivered "measurable benefits," per an AlphaSense transcript.

Shares of an aircraft manufacturer skyrocketed as a top executive said deliveries and free cash flow would trend higher in 2026, while a large semiconductor player extended its hot streak. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Tuesday, recovering from a sell-off in the prior session. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3%, the Dow added 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.6%. In another bright sign for risk assets, the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) clawed back some of its recent losses. See here for Investopedia's full coverage of today's top market stories. Boeing (BA) shares soared 10.2%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave provided an optimistic outlook for the aircraft manufacturer heading into 2026. Speaking at an industry conference, the executive touted Boeing's progress on its recovery plans and said the company expects to increase deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year. The plane maker also anticipates strong free cash flow growth in 2026. Intel (INTC) shares jumped 8.7%, adding to gains posted late last week amid speculation that Apple (AAPL) could be poised to become a new Intel customer. A potential deal with the iPhone maker would come on top of a string of high-profile agreements for Intel this year, including a partnership with AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). Stifel upgraded Teradyne (TER) stock to "buy" from "hold," and shares of the technology testing solutions provider gained 5.7%. Analysts pointed to a shift in Teradyne's focus toward high-growth markets, with AI applications expected to account for a more substantial portion of the firm's semiconductor test revenue as the business expands beyond its traditional smartphone and consumer markets. Companies in the paper and packaging business came under pressure Tuesday. The industry has faced concerns about sluggish consumer spending, elevated costs, and excess supply. Packaging Corporation of America (PKG) shares sank 5.3%. In its most recent earnings report released in October, Packaging Corp. posted lower-than-expected profit. Shares of competitors International Paper (IP) and Smurfit WestRock (SW) each fell 3.4% on Tuesday. AutoZone (AZO) shares slipped 3.1% following cautious commentary about the auto parts retailer from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment bank noted that AutoZone could face cost headwinds related to tariffs and increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses, although analysts still believe the company is positioned to benefit from positive industry trends.

When will AMD ship their GPU that can compete in all metrics with those NVIDIA GPUs? When that occurs we will see some major shifting of market caps! After all, it’s not magic, it’s engineering. iPhone sales matter more than anything to Wall Street. Certainly, actual product sales should matter more than some potential A.I. nonsense. I’m glad Wall Street is somewhat coming to its senses. It irks me that so much emphasis is put on A.I. despite only a few hardware companies are profiting from it. There are so many data centers being built, and yet the demand for A.I. doesn’t really exist for most consumers. Is there even enough energy to go around to power all those data centers, especially when the summer heat arrives? Your email address will not be published.
