Vehicle autonomy. The transformative expression of meritocracy writ large. Vehicle autonomy. The transformative expression of meritocracy writ large. The transformative expression of meritocracy writ large. It will drive me wherever IT wants to go? You’ll go where Elon (or Nvidia?) wants you to go. 😅 I have a vision of tiny little self driving chips cluttering the highway. Driverless Car!! Look forward to the future! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECsCK7Pxakw My hunch is that is AI generated. LOL! Interesting battle. But then Google has been making powerful AI chips for AI data centers for quite a while too. Only thing is they are only for internal Google data centers only....so far. Chip battle is heating up. Trial Attorneys will ask for government compensation to fill the lost revenue from not suing via the driver’s insurance for what is the manufacturer’s fault. (Of course, the manufacturer will still be sued.) Competition is good. Amazon is making their own AI processor too. Rather, TSMC is making EVERYONE’S AI processors. Is that the AI bubble? Yeah. Don’t forget Samsung will make some of Tesla’s AI5 chips too. In Texas. “Alpamayo” Why name a chip after dog food?
