NVIDIA Cloud Partner Nscale, the U.K.-based AI infrastructure company, is deploying 300,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPUs in AI factories across the United States, Portugal and Norway, with 60,000 NVIDIA GPUs now being established in the U.K. Nscale, OpenAI and NVIDIA are establishing Stargate U.K., which will feature NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs operating in Nscale’s U.K. data centers by 2026, bringing the most advanced U.S. technology to transform the nation’s economy and unlock opportunities with AI. OpenAI is expected to use this NVIDIA infrastructure to serve its models — including its latest and most advanced reasoning model, GPT-5. “Sovereign AI infrastructure is key to national resilience, economic growth and strategic autonomy,” said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. “This milestone deepens our commitment to providing critical AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.” “The U.K. has been a longstanding pioneer of AI and is now home to world-class researchers, millions of ChatGPT users and a government that quickly recognized the potential of this technology,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. “Stargate U.K. builds on this foundation to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, improve productivity and drive economic growth. This partnership reflects our shared vision that with the right infrastructure in place, AI can expand opportunity for people and businesses across the U.K.” Nscale and Microsoft also announced plans to build the U.K.’s most powerful supercomputer in Loughton. It is expected to feature more than 24,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Ultra GPUs to provide Microsoft Azure services in the U.K. "We are focused on ensuring that both the U.S. and the U.K. remain at the forefront of AI and cloud innovation," said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. “That is why we are partnering with NVIDIA to bring together our global platform with their latest compute, software and network capabilities so innovators across the country have the most powerful tools to shape the future with AI.” Additionally, CoreWeave today announced that it will establish an advanced data center in Scotland with Grace Blackwell Ultra GPUs, powered by renewable energy. “AI innovation and adoption is critical to national competitiveness, and CoreWeave is committed to delivering the infrastructure that makes it possible,” said Michael Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave. “This latest phase of CoreWeave investment in the U.K. will bring more advanced infrastructure to data centers across England and Scotland, giving researchers and businesses direct access to cutting-edge resources that strengthen the U.K.’s position in a fast-moving global technology landscape.” In addition, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently announced it will invest up to £500 million to modernize U.K. data centers in partnership with Digital Gravity Partners. These data centers will be refurbished to be NVIDIA-ready, enabling them to be equipped with the latest AI hardware to build the infrastructure for the AI industrial revolution — advancing science, transforming industries and creating new economic opportunities in the U.K. NVIDIA Accelerates the U.K. Quantum Ecosystem NVIDIA is also collaborating with U.K. quantum computing pioneers to accelerate technology development across quantum applications, error correction, infrastructure and AI integration. OQC and Digital Realty are establishing a quantum-AI center, working with NVIDIA to deliver the AI supercomputing that will support quantum processors. Based out of Digital Realty’s JFK10 facility in New York City, the OQC GENESIS system in the new center will harness the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ platform to bring together OQC’s quantum computing technology, NVIDIA AI infrastructure and Digital Realty’s data center interconnection and colocation expertise to provide businesses with secure, scalable access to integrated quantum-GPU computing.

US stock market experienced a modest pullback on Tuesday as investors balanced optimism from strong consumer spending against uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated policy meeting. Despite the slight declines in major indexes, economic data revealed robust retail sales in August, rising 0.6%, well above expectations. This indicates that American consumers remain resilient even as inflation persists and the labor market shows signs of softening.

Title: 3 High Yield Dividends To Buy As Stocks Hit All-Time Highs

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We’ve got a frankly, bizarre dynamic setting up in stocks right now. Global stocks are clobbering their American cousins this year. But here’s the disconnect: This is happening even though US stocks are hitting all-time highs seemingly every day. On the surface, it sounds like both of these can’t be true. But as we’ll see below, this setup makes total sense. We’ll also look at how we can play it for both offense—price upside, in other words—and defense (in the form of 8%+ dividends), too. Here we’re looking at the S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), in purple, compared to the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Index Fund (VEU), a good benchmark for global stocks (minus the US, as the name says), in orange. So what’s going on here? It’s only when we zoom out that things clear up: Over the long run, America’s lead is unquestionable—and it puts this year’s “blip” in much better context. This is why, if you subscribe to my CEF Insider service, you know I remain bullish on US stocks, particularly the high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold them. That’s because at CEF Insider we focus on dividends (often in the 8%+ range) and we think long-term. And while US stocks might trail for short periods, betting against America over the long term is always a mistake. But I do understand that more Americans are interested in buying international stocks. We can see that in the run they’ve put on this year: It quite simply wouldn’t have happened without Americans climbing aboard the global bandwagon. (America does, after all, have the highest percentage of stock investors in the world, at 55% of the population, going by the latest numbers from Visual Capitalist.) And holding at least some international stocks is just plain smart, especially if we see another April-style pullback in US markets. Beyond that, many international stocks pay higher dividends than US firms. Even looking across the northern border nets a considerably higher dividend yield, with index funds tracking major Canadian stocks yielding 2.6%, more than double the S&P 500’s 1.2%. But that’s still just 2.6%! Not nearly enough to fund a retirement on. VEU pays roughly the same. Then there’s VEU’s long-term underperformance, which I talked about a second ago. The main problem with VEU is that it’s simply too diversified. With its passive approach to owning just about everything abroad, it holds a lot of questionable companies in questionable countries. This is why actively managed funds (like the three 8%+ payers we’ll discuss below) have outperformed it in many cases. For instance, Tencent Holdings is one of VEU’s biggest positions, and the Chinese government has warned stock prices have gotten too high in the mainland as of late. That’s raised the possibility of new rules to limit stock speculation, which would hurt large stocks like Tencent. That’s why we want active management—especially in international stocks. That way we ensure we’re avoiding not just poor-quality companies but also those that operate in less-stable nations, where the rule of law may not be as strong as it is in places like North America and Europe. The three CEFs we’re going to discuss next give us that. Plus they’ve all beaten VEU (in green in the chart below) over the long term. And they’ve done so during a time when foreign assets were less popular among US investors. That sets them up for stronger gains now that more Americans are thinking globally. Let’s dive into them. The Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) gives us stock-like upside with convertible bonds acting as “ballast.” I say that because convertibles provide high, steady income, even in volatile markets. The result is a dividend that shows up every month and yields 8.1% on an annualized basis. With CHW, we’re effectively buying cash flow and the option to pivot between income-producing bonds and stocks, with both on sale; its largest positions—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and a Boeing (BA) 6% convertible preferred bond—let us tap surging AI growth, while the convertible bond dampens pullbacks with its steadier price and payouts. And because the fund’s mandate spans the world, management can shift with volatility. This flexibility has also helped keep the fund’s dividend steady over the last three years. Next up is the LMP Capital & Income Fund (SCD), with its combination of income-producing assets and capital-gains-producing stocks. The fund pays monthly, at a 9.3% annualized rate. And it’s cheap, too, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). SCD’s biggest positions consist of both tech darlings and utilities, with names like Marvell Technology (MRVL), Oracle (ORCL) and PPL Corp. (PPL) pairing growth and reliability. The result is a steady, diversified cash machine that can lean toward offense or defense without putting the dividend at risk. Finally, let’s talk about a less-obvious investment I like because it combines American blue chips and top foreign firms. The Virtus NFJ Dividend Value Fund (NFJ) captures income from foreign demand while blending in US firms, with their reliable regulations. It also generates extra income using a covered-call strategy that generates more income when global tensions rise. NFJ owns dividend payers and convertibles, sells call options and hands us a 9.3% dividend while trading at a steep 9.5% discount. The fund also uses zero leverage—a nice extra margin of safety should interest rates unexpectedly rise. With a portfolio dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL), AMD (AMD) and Prologis (PLD), this fund combines American giants with large margins and reliable cash flows with exposure to foreign demand (about half of Alphabet’s revenue comes from abroad, and about a quarter for AMD). Now, I’ve been saving the best part, and it’s this chart. SCD’s discount (in orange above) recently exploded to a premium before fading to its 6.7% discount. CHW’s 10.8% discount (in purple) has broken through the 10% mark a few times lately, and NFJ’s 9.3% discount (in blue) has narrowed quite a bit. On the whole, this tells us that more investors are noticing these funds, setting up their discounts to shrink further, putting a lift under their share prices as they do.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Rolling Regressions in Clojure for Real-Time Alpha and Beta Monitoring
URL: https://clojurecivitas.github.io/finance/portfolio_analysis/alpha_beta_regression.html
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Edward Widjaja cim Tanvi Nagar cim Matthias Buehlmaier cim September 16, 2025 This blog post presents a functional, reproducible implementation of rolling regression in Clojure to estimate time-varying alpha(α) and beta(β) for student-managed portfolios at the Centre for Investment Management (CIM), The University of Hong Kong. Unlike traditional CAPM tests based on passive index data, our analysis uses actual(synthetic) trades executed by junior portfolio managers- undergraduate students who manage simulated equity portfolios over multiple semesters. We use hypothetical trade data from student portfolio managers at the Centre for Investment Management, including: ● Trade dates, tickers, shares, prices ● Portfolio valuations over time(monthly rebalancing) ● Cash flows and position weights ● Returns are computed at the portfolio level, aggregated monthly from individual holdings. ● Benchmark: S&P 500 total return index ● Excess returns are calculated for both portfolios and the market. ● The risk free rate is omitted from analysis for ease of understanding concepts since it does not affect the final results presented in this proposal For each student portfolio, we estimate the CAPM regression over a rolling 12- or 24-month window: Using ordinary least squares(OLS), we obtain a time series of: ● Alpha(α): time-varying abnormal return(skill or luck?) ● Beta(β): evolving sensitivity to market movements(risk awareness?) ● Windows slide forward monthly, producing a dynamic view of performance. The full analysis pipeline is implemented in Clojure, designed for clarity, reuse, and integration into teaching workflows. Below are some core libraries that were used in the project. ● generateme/fastmath: for OLS regression and statistical operations ● scicloj/tablecloth: for data preparation and transformation ● clj-python/libpython-clj: to fetch price data using the yfinance library in Python ● org.clojure/data.csv: for inputting securities for analysis ● org.clojure/clojure.data.json: to parse JSON strings The below function uses a simple Python script (with the help of clj-python to integrate Python with Clojure) to fetch open and closing prices for NVIDIA stocks and the S&P 500 Index from Yahoo Finance. We can then obtain data as follows: Using the scicloj/tablecloth library, we transform our data, obtaining the stock and market closing prices and their dates. We continue with creating functions to calculate arithmetic returns, and calculating the day-by-day returns for the stock and the market. Now, this is where we implement our rolling market model, where we regress NVDA stock returns on the market returns using a rolling window to obtain sets of alpha and beta. To achieve this, we utilize the generateme/fastmath library to implement our very own rolling window regression function. Finally, we use these functions to obtain our sets of alpha and beta. Note that the size of the window is 252 to represent the number of trading days in a year. We present time-series plots of alpha and beta for multiple student portfolios across two academic years. While stock prices reflect market consensus, alpha and beta decompose returns into risk-adjusted components, revealing whether performance was due to systematic market exposure(beta) or true outperformance(alpha). This provides deeper insight than price alone, enabling informed evaluation of risk, skill, and value creation. The above charts show the alpha over time for NVDA(Nvidia) and the historical alpha tracking can help inform future trades. A close-up analysis of alpha reveals some interesting observations, for example: ● The declining trend in NVIDIA’s(NVDA) alpha relative to the S&P 500, as observed from October 2023 to July 2025, reflects a significant shift in the stock’s market performance dynamics. ● Initially exhibiting strong positive alpha-indicative of substantial outperformance over the broader market-NVDA’s excess return diminished steadily over time, converging toward zero by mid-2025. ● This erosion of alpha can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the normalization of AI-driven valuation premiums, increased competitive pressures from semiconductor peers, and a broader market environment characterized by robust S&P 500 performance that reduced NVDA’s relative advantage. Similarly, the above charts reveals some trends regarding the beta of the NVDA(Nvidia) stock: ● The time series of NVIDIA’s(NVDA) beta relative to the S&P 500 reveals a significant evolution in the stock’s sensitivity to market movements over the period from October 2023 to August 2025. ● Initially, NVDA exhibited a beta around 2.0, indicating that it was approximately twice as volatile as the broader market. Over the course of 2024, beta steadily increased, peaking near 2.9 in early 2025, reflecting heightened market exposure and amplified price swings during periods of strong investor enthusiasm for AI-driven growth. ● This elevated beta suggests that NVDA was behaving as a high-risk, high-reward asset, with returns highly correlated to-and often magnified by-market trends. However, beginning in April 2025, beta experienced a sharp decline, falling to 1.985 by August 2025, signaling a reduction in its volatility relative to the market. This decrease may reflect a combination of factors: valuation corrections, reduced speculative positioning, and a shift toward more stable, earnings-driven investment behavior. Hence, a portfolio manager when looking at the historical performance of NVDA, will be able to evaluate if the trade is adding value to their portfolio. A stock with a rising alpha and lower beta is a good sign for investment, since it presents a higher return for a lower level of risk. An evaluation of single stocks comprising a portfolio will give a good visual analysis of the stocks risk and return and the overall portfolio. A similar analysis can be conducted at the portfolio level as well to understand the portfolio manager’s performance- alpha creation against the market similar to an AMC tracking a fund’s performance. Rolling alpha and beta are not just statistics-they are mirrors. They allow students to: ● See the consequences of their strategies ● Distinguish luck from skill ● Adjust risk in response to market regimes This system has direct real-world applicability: ● Can be scaled to real fund management with minimal changes ● Provides a template for risk dashboards in small asset managers ● Integrates with automated compliance or alerting(e.g., “beta increased by 30% this month”) By turning student trades into living data, we move beyond theory to reflective practice. And by building in Clojure, we ensure that the system is not a black box—but an open book. In simple words we can decipher, the best financial models don’t just describe the world—they help people learn from it. ● Expand to multi-factor rolling models(e.g., FF3: market, size, value) ● Build a web dashboard using ClojureScript(Reagent) for real-time feedback and interactivity ● Implement automated alerts(e.g., “your beta has exceeded 1.5”) ● Add peer benchmarking: compare alpha trajectories across students ● Integrate with portfolio optimization tools for next-step recommendations ● Use the pipeline as a capstone module in investment management courses

CoreWeave (CRWV) said Monday it has signed a $6.3 billion initial order with Nvidia (NVDA) with a condition that the AI chip star buys unsold capacity, sending shares in the cloud computing platform surging. As part of the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any unsold cloud-computing capacity through April 13, 2032, if CoreWeave’s data centers aren’t fully utilized by its own customers. CoreWeave made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said the deal was struck on Sept. 9. Nvidia has ties with CoreWeave on several fronts. Apart from being a customer, Nvidia sells its chips to CoreWeave and has a stake in the cloud platform. Apart from Nvidia, CoreWeave’s customers include Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META). Separately, on Monday, Deutsche Bank added CoreWeave to its Catalyst Call Buy Idea List, citing “a few positive factors" that will support revenue revisions upward over the next quarter or two. CoreWeave will benefit as “spending intentions being signaled by those in industry and the scale of some of the recent contract announcements make demand for AI infrastructure appear almost insatiable and at least for the near-to-medium-term, demand significantly outstrips supply," wrote analyst Brad Zelnick. CoreWeave shares are rising almost 7% in intraday trading Monday and have gained more than 200% since going public in March this year in one of 2025’s hottest IPOs.

U.S. equities were higher at midday on positive comments about China trade and the future of TikTok from President Trump, as well as Tesla (TSLA) news. S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Tesla shares jumped as a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk purchased 2.57 million shares of the electric vehicle's stock valued at about $1 billion. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) traded above $200 for the first time on continued excitement over the company's new hard disk drive for artificial intelligence data centers. Intel (INTC) shares climbed after the struggling semiconductor maker reduced its target for full-year non-GAAP operating expenses after completing the $3.3 billion sale of a majority stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares were up for a third straight session, making the parent of Google the fourth company with a $3 trillion market capitalization. Corteva (CTVA) was among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 following a report that the manufacturer of crop seeds and pesticides is looking into splitting itself into two separate companies. Some chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), fell as Chinese regulators were investigating potential dumping of analog integrated circuit semiconductors from the U.S. U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca (AZN) declined after a report the drugmaker had paused a planned $272 million investment in Britain, and received a downgrade from Europe's Handelsbanken. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dipped.

Investa, the UK’s first zero-commission options trading app, is now available to investors after an active soft launch where over 1400 trades were facilitated — putting what they believe is an under-utilised investment product in reach of on-the-go traders and more sophisticated investors. 1 15 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The app, available on iOS, has been built by a team of former Citi options brokers and the co-founder of Freetrade, Ian Fuller. It was created to address the access gap in options trading for UK investors. It will be launched on Android in the months ahead. An option is a contract between two parties that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date. In exchange for this right, the buyer pays a premium. There are two main types of listed, tradeable options: Call option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Put option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Under 2% of UK retail investors have traded an option, compared with nearly 20% in the US, a gap Investa believes is driven by high costs, complex platforms and limited access. Addressing these challenges, the Investa app offers a streamlined experience designed around education, clarity, accessibility and transparency. Early feedback from the soft launch has been built into the app’s final features and interface. Key app features include: Zero commission (other fees apply) Access to over 200 stocks and ETFs with over 100,000 options contracts to trade No margin, cash accounts onlyClear, jargon-free terminology Intuitively designed options cards that strip back complexity During the soft launch, trading favourites included Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nike (NKE), with Nvidia alone representing over 20% of options activity. Alec Beasley, Co–founder and CEO of Investa, commented: “Our goal is to make the options market more accessible to savvy UK investors, as we believe it offers huge untapped opportunities. There is not a lack of interest in options trading, but rather a lack of access. High fees, confusing platforms and limited availability have kept UK investors out and we are directly addressing that gap. “The feedback from our soft launch was invaluable and has directly influenced the features and interface that are live today. We’re also enabling investors to join us on our journey through our second Crowdcube round as we strongly believe in community ownership. “Options trading has traditionally been an exclusive market, and we want to change that not only through the product but also through how we fund the company. Crowdfunding allows our early adopters to become shareholders and grow with us.” Marios Syrimis, Investa Investor and User, added: “I had tried options trading on other platforms, but it was difficult to get set up and their hidden fees were frustrating. I’ve traded on Investa several times now and have found the execution incredibly smooth. The user interface makes the options experience intuitive, which made it easy for me to get started. As both an investor and a customer, it’s refreshing to finally find a platform that really cares about making options accessible to UK investors.” The public launch of the app coincides with Investa’s second fundraising campaign on Crowdcube, following its record-breaking 2024 round that attracted just shy of 500 investors — the most participated-in UK fintech raise on Crowdcube that year. In its second Crowdcube raise, Investa is on a mission to target at least £1m, which will be used to develop and launch an Android app, scale its marketing operations, expand its product features, and grow the customer base following the public launch of the

CoreWeave (CRWV) were higher by about 5% in early U.S. trading Monday after the cloud computing company entered into a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to guarantee use of its excess server capacity, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the agreement, Nvidia will buy any unused computing resources from CoreWeave through April 2032. The arrangement ensures that CoreWeave’s vast fleet of data centers will not sit idle if customer demand fluctuates. If CoreWeave’s clients don’t fully book its servers, Nvidia is obligated to step in and purchase the residual capacity. Either company can exit the deal if one breaches terms or faces bankruptcy. For CoreWeave, the agreement locks in a long-term buyer for its spare capacity, reducing revenue risk as it builds out infrastructure. For Nvidia, it secures reliable access to cloud-based GPU resources at a time when demand for artificial intelligence training far exceeds supply. The agreement also strengthens ties between the two firms, as Nvidia not only supplies CoreWeave with GPUs but also holds an equity stake. Nvidia has already made CoreWeave one of its biggest bets. At the end of the second quarter, the AI chipmaker owned 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave worth about $3.96 billion. CoreWeave, founded in 2017, rents out access to Nvidia graphics processing units that power AI model training. The firm went public in March in what was the largest U.S. venture-backed tech IPO since 2021. Leading up to its debut, it raised billions in debt and equity financing, including from Nvidia itself. The stock surged roughly five-fold shortly following its April IPO, but subsequently lost about 50% during the summer. They've rebounded by about 35% since Labor Day.

If you’re wondering why bitcoin’s (BTC) price is slipping for the past two hours, the possible culprit is pre-market trading on Wall Street, where shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have dropped nearly 3%. The losses follow an announcement by China's market regulator that Nvidia allegedly violated the country's anti-monopoly laws during its acquisition of Israeli networking company Mellanox Technologies in 2020. The regulator said that Nvidia breached the terms of its conditional approval related to that acquisition, although the specific details of the violations have not been disclosed. The weakness in NVDA is accompanied by poor price action in the crypto market. As of writing, BTC traded at around $114,900, having reached a high of $116,755 earlier today. Top tokens associated with artificial intelligence, such as ICP, RENDER, FET, and GRT, traded over $ 4.5% lower on a 24-hour basis. Chip-maker NVDA is the world's largest publicly listed firm by market value and acts as a barometer for risk sentiment in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies and AI-related tokens. Bitcoin BTC$117,254.84 has historically taken cues from NVDA, with both bottoming out concurrently in late 2022 to embark on a record bull run. The rolling three-month correlation between NVDA and BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF was 0.76 as of Friday, according to data source Macroaxis.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher to begin a week featuring the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates; China is investigating Nvidia (NVDA) on antitrust charges stemming from a 2020 acquisition; U.S. officials said they are close to a resolution on Chinese ownership of TikTok as it faces a U.S. ban; Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging in premarket trading as CEO Elon Musk buys about $1 billion worth of company stock; and UnitedHealth Group (NVDA) reportedly is hiring allies of President Donald Trump as it faces investigations in Washington. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors look ahead to this week's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. S&P 500 futures are 0.2% higher by nearly 0.2% after the benchmark index rose 1.6% last week. Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are pointing slightly higher after posting gains last week, with the Nasdaq hitting another record closing high Friday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at under $115,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Oil futures are higher. Gold futures are ticking lower. China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Nvidia (NVDA) violated its antitrust laws with its 2020 acquisition of networking equipment maker Mellanox Technologies, and that they would further investigate the chipmaking giant. The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Madrid to continue negotiations on tariffs. Nvidia shares are roughly 1.5% lower in premarket trading. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. and China are close to a resolution on social media app TikTok, which is facing a ban in the U.S. over its Chinese ownership. Bessent said that a deal to divest TikTok from its Chinese parent ByteDance could hinge on other trade demands, per media reports. "We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app," Bessent said, according to Reuters. President Donald Trump has said he was looking for new buyers of the popular social media app, which was banned by the Biden administration. Tesla (TSLA) shares are soaring 8% in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk disclosed he purchased around $1 billion of the company’s stock on Friday, according to an SEC filing. Musk purchased around 2.57 million shares at various price points. It was his largest purchase of stock on the open market since February 2020, according to CNBC. The move comes as the company is asking shareholders to approve a pay package for Musk that could total nearly $1 trillion if certain performance milestones are met. UnitedHealth Group (NVDA) is hiring allies of President Trump and meeting with top administration officials as it faces government investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported. UnitedHealth, which is facing a criminal probe into its lucrative Medicare Advantage business, "increased its spending on lobbyists and lawyers with deep ties to President Trump's administration, including Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for the president, and Jesse Panuccio, who was a senior Justice Department official in Trump's first term," the Journal said. It added that CEO Stephen Hemsley "recently met with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles to discuss Medicare and other issues."

Title: Arista Stock To $300?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/arista-stock-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T11:30:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not sell GPUs. It does not create AI models. And it seldom makes headlines like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nevertheless, Arista has quietly established itself as one of the most significant technology firms in the market. Strong results for H1 2025 and elevated guidance have propelled the stock to its all-time high. Shares have risen by 60% in the last year, compared to an 18% increase for the S&P 500. However, the larger question remains: could Arista stock potentially double from its current position—rising from $150 to $300? To address this, let’s examine revenues, margins, and valuation. Additionally, if you’re interested in gaining exposure with less volatility than betting on a single stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. is worth considering. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns surpassing 91% since its initiation. In a separate note, see – Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? Arista is no longer merely a networking vendor. It has evolved into a growth engine directly associated with the AI expansion. In Q2 2025, the company reported revenue of $2.205 billion, reflecting a 30% year-over-year increase, and surpassing Wall Street projections. Over the preceding three years, Arista’s revenue has increased at an average rate of 32%. Indeed, revenue has ascended from $6.3 billion to $8.0 billion in just the past twelve months. What’s propelling this growth? The AI expansion. Hyperscalers and cloud behemoths—from Microsoft to Meta—are investing heavily in data centers. High-performance networking is the crucial element of these infrastructures, and Arista is providing the foundation. Importantly, this is not a temporary phenomenon. Management has upgraded its Q3 guidance to $2.25 billion, highlighting that momentum is ongoing. For a hardware company, this growth trajectory closely resembles that of software. Revenue growth is thrilling. However, margins reveal the true narrative. In Q2, Arista achieved a 40% net margin—surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Microsoft. Contemplate that for a moment. A networking hardware firm exhibiting software-level profitability. The key lies in EOS (Extensible Operating System), Arista’s cloud-native platform. EOS transforms switches and routers into programmable, software-defined equipment that hyperscalers depend on. This is why nearly 54% of revenue converts into operating cash flow, making it one of the best ratios in the S&P 500. Over the past year, Arista generated close to $4.0 billion in operating cash flow and $3.3 billion in net income, all while maintaining $8.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet with no debt. These margins are not cyclical; they are structural. They offer a buffer during downturns, as demonstrated by the quick recoveries following the 2020 COVID crash and the 2022 inflation-induced selloff. Consult ANET Dip Buyer Analyses for insight into how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Here is where the discussion intensifies. Arista trades at 58.5x earnings, 23.9x sales, and almost 48x free cash flow. On the surface, that appears steep—more akin to SaaS firms than traditional networking counterparts. However, context is critical. Deep-rooted partnerships with hyperscalers, AI-driven demand, and a robust balance sheet all rationalize a premium. Should revenue compound at 25–30% annually while margins remain above 40%, today’s valuation could rapidly normalize. So, is it feasible for Arista to double? At $150 per share, Arista’s $190 billion market capitalization represents approximately $3.2 billion in net income based on its current ~59× P/E ratio. For the stock to reach $300 (a $380 billion market cap), earnings would have to roughly double. At the current high multiple, that translates to about $6–7 billion in profits, or roughly $16 billion in revenue, assuming a 40% net margin—a target consistent with long-term projections. However, if the multiple decreases to a more justifiable 40×, Arista would need to achieve nearly $9–10 billion in earnings, or $24 billion in revenue, to support the same valuation. In other terms, the journey to $300 is plausible within the next 3-4 years, but it is contingent on both sustained growth and the market’s willingness to continue granting the stock a premium multiple. The risks are significant—cloud expenditure could decelerate, priorities in AI might change, and multiples could reduce. Our analysis suggests that a favorable outcome is probable, albeit one that may require investors and clients to adopt a long-term perspective. That being said, investing in a single stock can be precarious. You may want to look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an agile way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while curtailing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nebius Stock To $450?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-nebius-stock-keep-surging/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Approximately one year ago, AI-centric cloud company Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS) was largely dismissed as a leftover from Russian technology. Emerging from a split with Yandex, Russia's leading internet firm, it appeared destined to remain on the periphery of global technology. Instead, it has orchestrated one of the most impressive comebacks in the sector. Since it began trading last October at $20 per share, Nebius has rallied to $89, elevating its market capitalization to over $21 billion – a 350% increase in just about twelve months. Unlike many "story stocks," this increase is rooted in fundamentals: revenues are projected to rise from $117 million in 2024 to an anticipated $568 million in 2025 and $1.5 billion in 2026. Further fueling the momentum, Nebius recently secured a landmark $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to provide GPU infrastructure capacity over the following five years – validating its capabilities. Now, some of the biggest names in technology – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) – have built multi-trillion dollar valuations based on their cloud infrastructure. With AI now serving as the key growth driver in tech, we present an argument for how Nebius can leverage its exclusive AI focus to pave a path towards a valuation exceeding $100 billion in the upcoming years. Nebius is not a general-purpose cloud like AWS or Azure. It belongs to a new category of "Neoclouds" – infrastructure platforms designed exclusively for AI workloads, with computing, storage, networking, and management tools all optimized for training and operating large-scale AI models. While hyperscalers attempt to cater to everyone, Nebius concentrates on providing exactly what AI labs and organizations require most: high-performance, dedicated GPU infrastructure. The Microsoft agreement reinforces this strategy. The software giant has repeatedly encountered shortages in AI computing, exacerbated by its obligations to supply OpenAI. To bridge this gap, Microsoft will obtain dedicated capacity from a new Nebius data center in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. From ChatGPT transforming how we operate and conduct research to AlphaFold accelerating drug discovery and generative tools reshaping creative workflows, AI is driving nearly every sector – and Nebius could be powering the essential infrastructure that enables it all. Before we delve into the specific figures for Nebius stock, let’s recognize a crucial reality. Investing in individual stocks, particularly in high-growth firms like Nebius, carries inherent volatility. While the potential for upside is significant, the journey can be tumultuous. That said, if you're looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 91% since its launch. This diversified strategy can offer exposure to high-quality growth firms while managing the risks associated with individual stocks. Now, with this context in mind, let’s explore what makes Nebius's unique narrative so compelling. Indeed, there is considerable competition in this industry, but Nebius sets itself apart in a few key ways despite the competitive landscape. Firstly, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip frontrunner Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which manufactures the most advanced GPUs and essentially establishes industry benchmarks. Nvidia serves as both a significant partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and holds over 1 million Nebius shares. This partnership may provide Nebius preferential access to Nvidia’s most desired GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, granting it a vital advantage in a market where supply continues to lag behind demand. Another key differentiator is Nebius’s vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, bypassing OEMs and collaborating directly with manufacturers to cut costs, enhance performance, and quickly integrate the latest GPUs. This control accelerates deployment cycles and boosts efficiency — with infrastructure costs reportedly as low as $0.025 per GPU-hour. The company also provides transparent billing and imposes no lock-ins, making it particularly attractive to AI-first startups, where many innovations are taking place. This could help it better secure early customers. Let’s assess the scale of the opportunity. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads with an annual revenue run-rate exceeding $120 billion, while Microsoft’s Azure exceeded $75 billion in the previous fiscal year. AI workloads are even more compute- and memory-intensive, indicating that the AI cloud market may ultimately outstrip the current general-purpose cloud in terms of scale. The AI cloud segment is growing much more rapidly than the general-purpose cloud, as generative and automation use cases proliferate. Moreover, in contrast to hyperscalers, AI-centered clouds deploy specialized GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and tailored orchestration software, allowing for premium pricing, enhanced customer lock-in, and accelerated growth. The Microsoft agreement validates Nebius’s technology and could create opportunities for further partnerships with hyperscalers or enterprises. The numbers support the bullish perspective: consensus projections indicate revenue will increase from $568 million in 2025 to roughly $1.5 billion in 2026. Extending the trend, if Nebius compounds at 50% annually from 2026 through 2030, revenue could reach approximately $7.6 billion. Notably, the Microsoft contract alone could contribute over $3.5 billion annually by 2028, rendering the $7.6 billion figure possibly conservative. For context, Nebius currently trades at about 40× the estimated revenue for 2025. Even if this multiple contracts to 15× sales – which is not unusual for high-growth cloud infrastructure – that suggests a market cap of $114 billion. For comparison, Microsoft, valued at over $3.5 trillion, trades at nearly 12x sales, so this multiple should be reasonable for an earlier growth stage company like Nebius. With roughly 250 million shares outstanding, this translates to a stock price of around $459 per share by 2030. That represents an upside of more than 5x from the current stock price of $89. The bullish case for Nebius is predicated on the flawless execution of its significant Microsoft contract, ongoing preferential access to Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs, and financing rapid expansion without severely impacting its margins. Microsoft will also represent a disproportionate share of future revenue, leaving Nebius highly reliant on a single customer. Additionally, with the stock already trading at nearly 40× FY25 revenue – significantly above peers – any slowdown could adversely affect its valuation. It's also important to consider Nebius’s background and acknowledge its origins. The company was established as an offshoot of Yandex, Russia’s tech giant, and founder Arkady Volozh faced EU sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, which made investors apprehensive. Since then, Nebius has fully severed ties with Yandex’s Russian operations and has relocated to Amsterdam with an international engineering team. The EU lifted its sanctions last year, alleviating most of the geopolitical concerns, though the company’s Russian roots remain a small residual risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitcoin Escaped Nvidia's Clutches, Is AI Next?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) supremacy in artificial intelligence accelerators has made it one of the most valuable firms globally, with a market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion. Its financial results have been robust, with revenue climbing 56% compared to the same period last year, reaching $47 billion in the last quarter, and net margins consistently surpassing 50%. However, history serves as a warning. In the world of cryptocurrency, GPUs once held the top position but were ultimately substituted by custom-made ASICs that provided greater efficiency. With Broadcom recently announcing a substantial $10 billion order for its specialized AI chips, reportedly from OpenAI, investors are starting to wonder if AI might follow a comparable path. What could this imply for Nvidia’s long-term future? Regardless of how fast-growing and enticing, putting money into a single stock entails significant risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to mitigate stock-specific risk while offering potential upside. When Bitcoin was initially introduced, mining occurred using standard CPUs. Shortly after, miners realized that GPUs were more adept at handling the parallel computations demanded by Bitcoin's algorithm. Eventually, GPUs emerged as the preferred hardware, only to be later overtaken by FPGAs and eventually ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). ASICs introduced a significant transformation. These chips, designed specifically for Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm, provided orders of magnitude more efficiency and speed compared to GPUs. A single ASIC miner could achieve terahashes per second (essentially, the rate at which a machine can execute these guesses), while using considerably less power than setups centered around GPUs. The downside was specialization: ASICs were limited to mining Bitcoin or similar algorithms, while GPUs could easily transition between different coins or even be adapted for gaming and AI. This led to a complete restructuring of the industry. Mining became capital-intensive and was dominated by large industrial entities capable of investing in extensive ASIC farms. GPUs remain popular among smaller miners, hobbyists, and those mining altcoins that resist ASICs or are tailored for GPU mining. Nvidia’s GPUs set the standard for training large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, and they support the majority of the AI infrastructure at hyperscalers. Over the past three years, tens of billions were invested in GPU clusters, driving Nvidia’s swift ascent. For perspective, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) anticipated spending a combined $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. However, the economics surrounding AI may also be shifting. Training large models remains heavily reliant on GPUs, yet this is likely to be a relatively initial-heavy task. As the most readily available data on the Internet is utilized by LLMs (large language models) with diminishing returns from larger models, training growth could moderate somewhat. The majority of future demand is likely to be for inference – executing trained models at scale to respond to billions of queries. In contrast to training, inference is repetitive, reliable, and very sensitive to costs. This is precisely where custom chips could excel, just as ASICs did for Bitcoin. Related: Will Broadcom Chips End AMD Stock’s AI Dreams? The most compelling indicator emerged last week, when Broadcom announced a $10 billion order for custom AI chips from a singular client, widely thought to be OpenAI. If true, this could imply that OpenAI is relocating a portion of its inference operations away from Nvidia GPUs, likely in pursuit of improved efficiency and reduced costs. Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, has underscored the rise of XPUs or custom accelerators, crafted for specific workloads. These chips could provide hyperscalers with greater control over their infrastructure costs while decreasing reliance on Nvidia’s high-priced GPUs. For OpenAI, whose ChatGPT serves millions of daily users, minor reductions in cost per inference could lead to substantial savings at scale. Having alternatives to Nvidia also enhances bargaining power for GPUs. The attraction of ASICs in both crypto and AI is evident: efficiency, lower energy consumption, and consistent performance for repetitive tasks. For firms operating AI workloads at large scales, these benefits may prove irresistible. However, there are downsides as well. Once produced, the functionality of an ASIC chip is mainly static, in contrast to GPUs which can be reprogrammed or upgraded. Just as Bitcoin ASICs were confined to the SHA-256 algorithm and vulnerable to protocol alterations, AI-specific chips may not possess the flexibility of GPUs. If AI models rapidly advance or architectures evolve, ASICs could become outdated. On the other hand, GPUs remain extremely adaptable, capable of managing both training and inference across diverse models. The design and manufacturing of custom ASICs is also expensive and time-intensive, potentially making them less accessible to smaller firms. For Nvidia, the risk is that its central growth driver – GPUs for AI – may not be as stable as it appears. While training tasks will likely continue to be dominated by GPUs, as the shift toward custom silicon for inference unfolds, Nvidia might experience a decline in demand. Broadcom’s agreement could signify the first step in a larger trend, as hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Meta contemplate similar approaches while additionally developing their own chips. Nvidia still benefits from ecosystem advantages and a comprehensive software platform (CUDA) that assists in better securing customer loyalty. Nonetheless, considering the high valuations and strong momentum, the threat posed by ASICs is one that investors should closely monitor. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably surpassing its benchmarks, which include all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. Think the Dow’s 30 powerhouses are all unstoppable money machines? Think again. Some are value-destroying black holes; others are relentless value creators. The data? Ruthless. The takeaway? Crystal clear: Master these three battle-tested value principles or watch your empire crumble. These aren’t isolated hacks—they amplify each other like a chemical reaction. Nail all three? You have a chance to become a permanent value-creator. Botch them? You’re a relic like Boeing or 3M, hemorrhaging returns. Mixed bag? Expect mediocre muddling. The ultimate irony: firms laser-focused on stakeholder value make much more money than firms focused primarily on making money.
