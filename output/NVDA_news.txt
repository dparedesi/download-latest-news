Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

I’m using it in my CPA practice recently and I find it extremely helpful tool and its uses going to help me increase my fees and decrease my time a win-win Sell Microsoft? Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. You should use real intelligence to construct a coherent sentence. I don’t think the issue is the efficacy of AI, the issue is too many AI engines, and start ups centered around them, which has led to too much investment concentrated in the category. Use one company’s AI to vet the work product of another company’s AI—while you take a nap! Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money. One more thing, restoring and recommissioning old nuclear plants to feed the server or data farms? No risk in that is there? Anything is possible if you can get your hands on enough of OPM. It becomes all about he multiples and keeping the show attractive. On the other side of the equation though, I asked google what dividend stocks to invest in for long term income. Three out of the four named are the same ones I spent days doing research and screening to find and ultimately bought. The citations given were complete, current and mostly well reasoned. Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, is predicting that two big-named tech stocks will hit astronomical market caps. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share.

Title: RGTI Stock: Path To 10x Growth

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/11: In this photo illustration, the Rigetti Computing logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

July 17, 2025 09:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., July 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - On the heels of the latest Drone Production Governmental initiatives and Executive Orders, manufacturing efforts have rapidly increased. For example, in the commercial drone space, the Indoor Inspection and Surveillance Drone Market is growing globally. Technological advancements in drone capabilities have significantly improved their suitability for industrial applications.

According to industry reports: “Warehouse inspection has emerged as one of the most critical applications for indoor inspection drones, driven by the increasing complexity of supply chain operations and the increasing demand for automation in logistics. Warehouses, particularly those in e-commerce, retail, and third-party logistics, require regular inspections to ensure operational efficiency, inventory accuracy, and infrastructure maintenance. The manufacturing sector has become one of the leading adopters of indoor inspection drones, driven by the increasing need for automation, precision monitoring, and predictive maintenance. Manufacturing facilities, particularly in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics, require frequent inspections of machinery, production lines, and inventory storage areas to ensure operational efficiency and compliance with quality standards. Indoor drones equipped with AI-powered visual imaging and thermal sensors enable real-time monitoring of production processes, detecting potential defects, equipment malfunctions, and structural vulnerabilities.” Active Companies in the drone industries include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), ParaZero Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: PRZO), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR), AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIRO). The article continued: “The North American indoor inspection drone market is witnessing substantial growth, driven by increasing industrial automation, stringent safety regulations, and advancements in drone technology. On the basis of Type, the Global Indoor Inspection Drone Market has been segmented into Rotary-wing Drones, Hybrid Drones, Fixed-wing Drones. Rotary-wing Drones accounted for the largest market share of 78.65% in 2024, with a market value of USD 4,013.90 Million and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16.86% during the forecast period. Hybrid Drones was the second-largest market in 2024. Rotary-wing drones are the most commonly used type in indoor inspection applications as a result of their ability to hover, maneuver in tight spaces, and perform precise inspections in complex industrial environments.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Decentralized trading platform Aster, backed by YZi Labs, has launched a groundbreaking new product, stock perpetual contracts, offering crypto-native traders leveraged exposure to leading U.S. equities without intermediaries or custodial limitations. The addition of these stock-based derivatives marks a bold step forward in Aster’s ongoing mission to redefine the boundaries between traditional finance and DeFi. With the new stock perpetuals live on Aster Pro, users can now trade high-demand equities like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), all with up to 50x leverage. More stocks are expected to be added soon. Unlike conventional brokerage platforms that operate within strict trading hours and require full KYC compliance, Aster’s decentralized model empowers users with 24/7 access to equity markets, eliminating red tape, signups, and custodial delays. While liquidity may vary during off-peak hours, reflecting real-world stock market dynamics, Aster ensures efficient execution during U.S. market hours via its deep liquidity pools. This means traders can manage their exposure at all times, with optimal performance during key trading windows. The upcoming NASDAQ 24/5 trading rollout is expected further to improve Aster’s liquidity sync with traditional markets. Leonard, Aster’s Chief Executive, remarked: “Aster is about breaking down barriers, whether that’s asset types, market hours, or outdated trading infrastructures. With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest U.S. equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Aster’s pricing infrastructure relies on the Pyth Network, ensuring accurate and tamper-resistant price data through aggregation from multiple verified sources. This system supports the security and transparency of all Aster perpetuals, be it crypto or stock-based, enabling users to make informed trading decisions with confidence. Combined with a high-speed matching engine and optimized liquidity management, Aster has earned its place as the second-largest perpetual DEX by global trading volume. Traders can use Aster’s stock perps for a variety of strategies. For example, an investor holding Tesla shares outside of the blockchain can hedge downside risk by opening a short position on TSLA/USDT directly on Aster, fully on-chain and permissionless. The introduction of stock perpetual contracts is the latest milestone in Aster’s groundbreaking year. Following the successful launch of the Aster Mobile app, the beta release of Aster Chain —a privacy-first, zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain—and the debut of Hidden Orders, Aster is rapidly expanding its ecosystem to serve both casual traders and seasoned professionals. Aster is pioneering a new frontier by fusing the open, composable nature of decentralized finance with access to real-world assets like U.S. equities. With this vision, the platform is dissolving the boundaries between crypto and traditional finance, crafting a seamless, multi-asset trading experience—all within a decentralized, non-custodial framework. The exchange is actively shaping a future where traders can seamlessly interact with multiple asset classes—all from a decentralized and non-custodial environment.

More on a smartphone screen, with the company's stylized branding visible in the background, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) D-Wave Quantum stock (NYSE: QBTS) has witnessed immense growth, skyrocketing over 1,000% in the past twelve months due to increasing enthusiasm for quantum computing. Several factors influenced this remarkable performance: Additionally, if you seek a smoother investment than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Furthermore, take a look at – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified The quantum computing industry is transitioning from research and development to securing commercial applications. D-Wave’s quantum annealing technology is particularly effective for optimization challenges across various sectors including logistics, finance, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence. As these applications evolve from proof-of-concept to commercial usage, the potential for revenue could increase dramatically. The transition to cloud-based quantum computing services signifies a major revenue opportunity. D-Wave’s cloud-based quantum computing offerings position it to gain substantial market share in this swiftly expanding area, enabling customers to utilize quantum computing capabilities without significant capital expenditures. Related – What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Quantum computing has emerged as a national security priority, with governments worldwide making considerable investments in quantum research and development. D-Wave’s established technologies and collaborations position it to secure valuable long-term government contracts, providing consistent revenue streams and validation for commercial applications. For instance, D-Wave has successfully completed a significant defense-oriented installation through its partnership with Davidson Technologies. The physical setup of a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum system is finalized at Davidson’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama, marking the first annealing quantum computer to be hosted on-site in the state. NVIDIA serves as the most pertinent comparison for QBTS’s potential growth trajectory. Between 2016 and 2024, NVIDIA stock surged from around $8 to more than $130 (adjusted for splits), marking a 16x increase. This expansion occurred as NVIDIA evolved from a gaming graphics firm to a core component of AI infrastructure. Similarly, D-Wave may capitalize on the burgeoning quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to over $400 in 2020-2021, illustrating how groundbreaking applications can lead to explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly disrupt industries once they gain commercial traction. The company is subject to a variety of inherent risks. D-Wave Quantum is distinctively positioned to benefit from the shift of quantum computing from research to commercial implementation. The company’s technological dominance, first-mover advantage, and an expanding market create major opportunities for growth by tenfold over the next 3-5 years. The prevailing conditions, characterized by rising computational demands, considerable government spending, and the maturing of quantum applications, resemble the introductory phases of the internet or AI revolution. D-Wave’s established technology and commercial emphasis position it to capture disproportionate value as this evolution accelerates. Although significant risks remain, the chance for revolutionary impact across various industries warrants a premium valuation for investors with the suitable risk appetite and long-term investment perspectives. We underscore the considerable risk tied to this investment; therefore, investors should thoughtfully evaluate these risks or consider professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio with a selection of 30 stocks that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded greater returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Larry Ellison, Oracle Corp.’s ORCL co-founder and chairman, has once again overtaken Meta Platforms, Inc. META CEO Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's second-richest person. This is despite them both having $251 billion net worth. What Happened: According to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Ellison and Zuckerberg are tied at $251 billion, but because Ellison has gained $59 billion this year while the Meta CEO is up $43.4 billion, the Oracle co-founder might have placed above. This ranks him just after Tesla Inc. TSLA and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who remains the world's richest person at $358 billion. Others in the top five wealthiest individuals list are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos and former Microsoft Corporation MSFT CEO Steve Ballmer, with net worths of $247 billion and $174 billion, respectively. See Also: Nvidia Says ‘Washington Gets It’ After Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks Says US Has To ‘Outcompete’ Global Rivals Why It’s Important: Ellison's wealth, more than 80% of which is tied to Oracle stock and options, soared as Oracle shares climbed 47.27% in the last six months, reported Bloomberg. The rally followed news on Tuesday that the U.S. government would ease export restrictions, allowing chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD to resume selling some semiconductors to China. Oracle, which relies on high-end chips for its cloud and AI infrastructure, was among the top beneficiaries of the policy shift with a gain of 2.48% during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to Benzinga Pro. The company has also inked multibillion-dollar cloud deals and ramped up partnerships with firms including OpenAI and SoftBank Group SFTBF SFTBY as part of its Stargate initiative. Oracle's stock has also nearly tripled since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the report said. According to Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, Oracle is demonstrating strong positive momentum in the short, medium and long term. Additional performance insights are available here.

Title: NVDA Stock To $200?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BEIJING, CHINA - JULY 15: Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp, ... More receives a media group interview before attending the welcome dinner of the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) on July 15, 2025 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Wan Quan/VCG via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has announced that it received confirmations from the Trump administration permitting it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after encountering a ban around April. This development comes just days after Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump. This decision represents a significant victory for Nvidia, which had been affected by stringent U.S. export controls designed to limit China’s access to advanced AI technology. The H20 chip, specifically created to adhere to U.S. regulations on chip exports, is less powerful than Nvidia’s leading products but has continued to be in high demand among Chinese clients. Separately, could oil help foster peace? See Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified. Nvidia recorded a $4.5 billion write-off in its most recent quarter due to unsold H20 chips that it could not reallocate to other markets. If sales of these high-volume chips to China resume, reversing some of this write-off could enhance earnings. Nvidia stock has been a strong performer this year, climbing nearly 18% to approximately $170 per share. Now, could easing U.S.-China tech tensions propel the next phase of Nvidia’s climb towards the $200 threshold? (related:What’s Happening With XRP Price?) China represents a vast and swiftly expanding AI market, hosting tech behemoths like Baidu and Alibaba, along with newcomers such as DeepSeek, that are increasingly competing with the U.S. in AI software development. Nevertheless, China still significantly lags in AI hardware, as domestic AI chips produced by companies like Huawei do not match the performance delivered by Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs. This establishes a profound dependence on Nvidia's technology to fulfill China’s AI aspirations. Simultaneously, China is an essential market for Nvidia. The nation generated $17 billion in revenue for the company in the fiscal year concluding in January 2025, which is roughly 13% of Nvidia’s total revenue. Moreover, this figure may not fully capture the breadth of the situation. Numerous Chinese tech firms have reportedly utilized gray market resellers and overseas intermediaries in nations like Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam to circumvent U.S. export restrictions and acquire Nvidia’s top-tier chips. These activities have led to governments enhancing enforcement measures and instigating crackdowns. Should the technology trade conflict ease, the recommencement of direct sales could substitute some of this shadow demand, offering Nvidia a clearer and more scalable growth trajectory in China. Nvidia is concentrating on balancing its response to this Chinese demand while adhering to U.S. regulations. The company additionally stated that it has created a new AI chip for China, aimed at applications in factory automation and logistics. This chip is based on Nvidia's most advanced Blackwell architecture but includes downgrades in certain features to address concerns raised by the U.S. government regarding the export of cutting-edge technology to China. While Nvidia stock has momentum in its favor, we consider that the stock may already be somewhat overvalued. We value Nvidia stock at approximately $130 per share, around 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more information. Certainly, Nvidia trades at about 40x forward earnings, which is justifiable considering that the company is set to increase revenues by 55% according to consensus estimates. However, there are some reasons to exercise caution. While Nvidia continues to be the benchmark for AI, the rally driven by "fear of missing out" that has propelled the stock over the past two years might start to lose momentum. Over the last three years, major technology companies have invested heavily in training increasingly larger AI models, significantly elevating the demand for Nvidia’s high-performance chips. Nonetheless, incremental performance improvements from larger AI models could begin to plateau, and the availability of high-quality training data may also present as a bottleneck. Additionally, the AI landscape may begin shifting from training to inference, where efficiency and cost become more significant than sheer power. In this transition, AMD’s MI series and open-source models might become more competitive. AMD’s ROCm software platform, although not as sophisticated as Nvidia’s CUDA, is expected to be sufficient for many inference tasks. This potential transition in AI workloads, combined with the risks associated with growth normalization, could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia’s most powerful and costly GPUs, potentially slowing the pace of its earnings growth in the future. Worried about the risks to NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; exhibiting less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics
