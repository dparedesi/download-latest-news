AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Do you already hold Nvidia stock? You may want to think about retaining it. Are you planning to buy in? This could be your opportunity. Nvidia has emerged the most important semiconductor player in the AI space, driven by its advanced GPU architectures that form the backbone of AI training and inference workloads across industries. The stock has surged 30% this year, and remains up about 90% from its April 2025 lows. Reflect on the following information. While we prefer to buy dips if the fundamentals are strong — for NVDA, see Buy or Sell NVDA Stock — we remain cautious about falling knives. Particularly, it’s essential to determine whether, if conditions worsen and NVDA declines another 20-30% to $126 levels, we could maintain our position in the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during several economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Here are the specifics, but first, as a brief background: NVDA offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, in strategic partnership with Kroger Co. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis Concerned that NVDA may drop significantly further? You might want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks renowned for comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What’s the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment journey, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The major U.S. equities indexes rebounded Tuesday afternoon from earlier losses amid lingering worries about U.S.-China trade tensions. The Dow and S&P 500 were slightly higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was little changed. Intel (INTC) shares dropped to lead losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after a downgrade by Bank of America analysts to "underperform" from "neutral," saying the stock has climbed "too far, too fast" on optimism about recent AI deals. Arista Networks (ANET) shares also fell after Nvidia (NVDA) announced Meta Platforms (META) and Oracle (ORCL) will use its data center switches, increasing competition with those from Arista. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) and other firms tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the prices of digital coins. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) shares gained after the pizza delivery giant posted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates as promotions and demand for its stuffed crust pizza boosted sales. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) also climbed after the financial firm exceeded profit forecasts and boosted its profitability guidance as federal regulators lifted a cap on the bank's growth as punishment for a fake account scandal. Walmart (WMT) shares rose after the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said it is partnering with OpenAI to allow customers to buy goods from Walmart through ChatGPT. Gold prices climbed to notch a fresh high above $4,100 an ounce. Crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen.

Title: Looking for Taylor Swift Returns

Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:59:28Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedOctober 14, 2025 Legend has it that in November 2004 Taylor Swift was “discovered” in Nashville. A youngster at the time, merely 14 years old, she was playing guitar and singing at the Bluebird Café when a music promoter heard her, took a look, and decided that this gal was going places. And as you surely know, today she’s a huge mega-star. Taylor Swift in Nashville, but no I didn’t see her. Courtesy billboard.com. Well, I was in Nashville too, last week in fact. But sorry to say, I didn’t see Taylor Swift, nor did I discover any future big-time songstresses. Indeed, I didn’t even hit the music scene. Because I was busy. I was on the company clock at a Paradigm Press event at Nashville’s Renaissance Hotel; me, numerous colleagues, a bunch of audiovisual bubbas, and about 800 guests. We all came together to discuss U.S. and global markets, particularly with respect to precious metals, other critical metals, technology, biotech, crypto, macro trends and much more. Many things are booming in the markets, with some offering “Swift” returns just now, if you’ll excuse the pun, and the numbers are eye-popping (see below). So, I’ll leave singing to Taylor Swift and instead discuss a few things that I heard in Nashville about making money. And really; some of the investment ideas from Nashville could possibly go “Taylor Swift” upside on you if things play out. Let’s dig in… I’ll begin with what I heard from a colleague and friend Ray Blanco, our resident tech and biotech guru. How good is Ray? Well, he (humbly) reminded us of how in 2015 he recommended a then-modest chipmaking company called Nvidia (NVDA); yes, that one. When you adjust for splits, Ray’s 2015 entry price was $0.50 per share; and consider that today’s bid/ask for Nvidia is over $188. In other words, in the past decade Ray delivered readers a gain of over 37,500%. And yes, you are reading that number correctly. Which means that Ray has minted more than a few multimillionaires if they held their original shares, or even if they sold off fractions of their holding on the way up. Ray explained how he did it, and it began with a tech conference in Las Vegas in 2015. There, he took a hard look at Nvidia when the company’s brand emphasized its specialized chips for video gaming consoles. Back then, gaming and gamers were kind of a geeky niche market, but Ray discerned that the same processing capability that delivers game-quality video might transfer over to other areas. And this led to his Nvidia recommendation. As events unfolded, it turned out that Nvidia chips could process immensely large data streams. Thus, Nvidia’s chips were particularly useful for crypto mining, and more recently for massive bit-crunching that goes on with artificial intelligence (AI). And so, Nvidia leads the tech charge these days, and boasts a market cap over $4.5 trillion (yes, trillion with a “t”). Hmm… Kind of a Taylor Swift story, when you think about it. Having established his cred, Ray went on to discuss what he has up his sleeve now. The short answer is that Ray sees a massive robot revolution coming to America. Indeed, Ray envisions America’s old Rust Belt transforming into a “Robot Belt.” It’s in the beginning phases and rapidly ramping up big-time as Ray looks out five to ten more years. Ray foresees robots coming to job sites almost everywhere, from office work to stores and warehouses, factories, farms, mines, mills and more. And Ray explained how the rise of robots will dovetail nicely with American demographics, considering the aging Baby Boomers and how the trend is to replace people in jobs that are repetitive and boring if not physically dangerous. In one example of the robotic future, Ray showed an astonishing video of an AI-controlled farm implement that navigates through plowed fields, a self-driving robot-tractor, so to speak. It identifies weeds with advanced optics and zaps them with a laser beam. This beast can work all day, and even at night because of its night-vision capabilities. In essence, this machine – truly a system of systems – will make farming way more efficient, and also eliminate the need for quite a lot of agricultural chemicals currently in use. And absent the agrichemicals, it’ll lead to healthier food in general. Of course, China too is building its own versions of robot workers, factories, etc., and the Chinese are aggressive. So obviously, the U.S. must compete hard to make things work out for our own economy. And along these lines, Ray laid out several investable non-Chinese opportunities in the robot arena. Meanwhile in Nashville, many of us were watching the charts, but not for Taylor Swift’s latest album. No, we were watching as the price of gold popped over $4,000 per ounce, while silver hit the $50 level. Clearly, something is going on. I learned long ago, in geochemistry class at Harvard (back at “that” Harvard, not the current one), that gold and silver atoms don’t change over time. Indeed, elements like gold and silver are formed in stellar supernovae, and to all intent and purpose are immutable. In other words, the metals don’t change, but their rising price reflects the fall in value of our currency, created and controlled by not-so-cosmic forces in Washington, D.C. And then this week, as the newly reinaugurated Columbus Day holiday unfolded, gold broke over $4,100 and silver crossed above $52; and yes, these prices can bounce around, up and down, but the trend is clear: up-up-up for metals and down-down-down for dollars. As I’ve noted many times, the chief driver for rising gold prices over the past three years was buying by central banks that want to de-risk from holding dollars, definitely in a world of mercurial U.S. politics and sanctions. On the silver side, one key driver for rising prices has been global-scale industrial demand, particularly for more and more use in electronics and solar panels. One way or another, these demand forces push against supply, whether it’s new metal out of the mine pits, or from recycling what’s already here. Another angle on this rising trend for precious metal has to do with “paper” gold and silver, namely the worldwide trading system that pretends to sell metal but is actually just an elaborate gambling pit. That is, most precious metal trading has nothing to do with the metal; it’s all about buying or selling a claim on gold and silver bars that never leave the bullion bank. Except that… well, whoops! We currently have a massive imbalance between “paper” metal and the physical version, and this has created pressure within the physical supply chain. People, businesses and even governments are actually doing what’s called “standing for delivery” for precious metal from bullion banks, which in turn must come up with real ounces to wheel out onto the loading dock. With silver, for example, bullion banks have set themselves up with short positions on paper product; i.e., they sold claims on ounces that do not exist. And now, claimants want the metal but it’s not down in the vault. Indeed, we have far more claims via paper silver ounces than there are physical metal ounces available for delivery. And those delivery requests are surging, which is leading to a collapse in inventories. Looking ahead, markets appear to anticipate a breakout of “failures to deliver,” which will wreck confidence in the pricing structure. And thus, we’re on a trend that could lead to $100 an ounce for silver before year-end. This is what happens when markets become overly financialized, when leverage meets absolute scarcity in an environment of “panic.” That is, when just about everybody with a claim shows up at the same time to demand fulfillment on the underlying promise. I could go on with these points, but I want to switch over and discuss the mining side. Gold and silver prices are rising, which is easy to see at a glance. But what about the mining sector? Well, in general share prices for miners lag the rate of rise in the product they produce. Or look at it this way. Mining companies have an asset called an ore deposit in the ground, and they mine rock, process ore, and refine their material into mineral concentrates, if not produce actual gold or silver. And they carefully calculate costs along the way. Let’s say that in 2022, it cost a company $1,500 to mine an ounce of gold, and the metal sold for, say, $2,000 per ounce, a profit of $500. Okay, great. But now in 2025, let’s say that mining that same ounce of gold costs $2,100 (yes, inflation in labor, materials, energy, etc.), but the sales price is $4,100. Well, the profit has quadrupled from $500 to $2,000, or 4x what it was just a couple of years ago. Here’s a chart to help visualize things. Mining has become a cash machine. Courtesy Mr. Uppy on X/Twitter. In other words, miners in general are looking at serious cash flow benefits from gold and silver, not to mention better days ahead for whatever else comes out of the pits associated with precious metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel and much more, depending on the geology. Looking ahead, if mining companies can keep their costs under control, and the price of energy stays reasonable (eg., oil prices don’t explode upwards), we should see superb cash flows and margins across the sector. And that will attract more and more investors who are currently fixated on the tech vaporware bubble. In other words, if you already own miners then good for you. If you don’t own them, you had better get on the train because it’s moving out of the station. Or stated another way… The mining sector is about to go all Taylor Swift on us. There’s more to say, but that’s enough for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

Title: Markets Set For Lower Open As China Conflict Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated. Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. A broad-based selloff swept global stock markets this morning after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times that China “will be hurt the most” if it doesn’t submit to Washington’s trade demands. At the same time, China showed no signs of backing down from President Trump’s trade war: It imposed sanctions banning Chinese companies from doing business with the U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.63% on the news. S&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. The index opened the better part of 1% lower almost immediately. Markets in Asia and Europe were almost all down, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 off 2.58% and Europe’s Stoxx 600 down 0.49% by midmorning. Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth materials—which the U.S. is dependent on—are “a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them,” Bessent said. “Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,” he told the FT. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most. “They are in the middle of a recession/depression,” he added, “and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they’re exacerbating their standing in the world.” (China is, in fact, doing very well. Its exports rose 8.3% in September, and the World Bank expects China’s GDP to grow 4.8% this year. U.S. growth is forecast at 1.4%.) The mood among traders today is a stark reversal from yesterday, when the S&P 500 rose 1.56% after investors realized that Trump and China President Xi Jinping will likely meet at the upcoming APEC conference at the end of October—an opportunity for both men to reach one of Trump’s famous deals. Elsewhere, there wasn’t much to cheer up the markets. A third of bettors on Polymarket think the U.S. government shutdown will continue beyond Nov. 8. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer sentiment remains low: The University of Michigan’s consumer survey, which asks whether buyers feel now is a good time to make a major purchase, lately “points to year-over-year growth in this measure of core spending slowing to near-zero soon, a far cry from the 6% pace earlier this year,” according to Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen. Goldman Sachs added to the gloom by publishing a note this morning titled “Jobless growth.” “The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead. We expect the great majority of U.S. potential GDP growth to come from solid productivity growth boosted by advances in artificial intelligence, with only a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration,” authors Pierfrancesco Mei and David Mericle said. In the longer term, however, most analysts continue to see stocks going up, driven largely by the tech and AI sector. “Roughly half of this S&P 500 bull has been driven by just seven stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA),” Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told clients in a note. But “the Fed is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, and inflation appears to be under control despite increased tariffs, likely eliminating that as a potential bull market killer.” Here’s a snapshot of the markets this morning: © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

October 13, 2025 19:39 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced it will start shipping NVIDIA DGX Spark™, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. AI workloads are quickly outgrowing the memory and software capabilities of the PCs, workstations and laptops millions of developers rely on today — forcing teams to shift work to the cloud or local data centers. As a new class of computer, DGX Spark delivers a petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a compact desktop form factor, giving developers the power to run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally. In addition, DGX Spark lets developers create AI agents and run advanced software stacks locally. “In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.” DGX Spark brings together the full NVIDIA AI platform — including GPUs, CPUs, networking, CUDA® libraries and the NVIDIA AI software stack — into a system small enough for a lab or an office, yet powerful enough to accelerate agentic and physical AI development. By combining breakthrough performance with the reach of the NVIDIA ecosystem, DGX Spark transforms the desktop into an AI development platform. DGX Spark systems deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance, accelerated by a NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, NVIDIA ConnectX®-7 200 Gb/s networking and NVIDIA NVLink™-C2C technology, providing 5x the bandwidth of fifth-generation PCIe with 128GB of CPU-GPU coherent memory. The NVIDIA AI software stack is preinstalled to enable developers to start working on AI projects out of the box. With DGX Spark, developers can access NVIDIA AI ecosystem tools including models, libraries, and NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, enabling local workflows such as customizing Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 models to refine image generation, creating a vision search and summarization agent using the NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason vision language model, or building an AI chatbot using Qwen3 that is optimized for DGX Spark. To celebrate DGX Spark shipping worldwide, Huang hand-delivered one of the first units of DGX Spark to Elon Musk, chief engineer at SpaceX, today in Starbase, Texas. The exchange was a connection to the supercomputer’s origins, as Musk was among the team that received the first NVIDIA DGX™-1 supercomputer from Huang in 2016. Other early recipients of DGX Spark, including Anaconda, Cadence, ComfyUI, Docker, Google, Hugging Face, JetBrains, LM Studio, Meta, Microsoft, Ollama and Roboflow, are testing, validating and optimizing their tools, software and models for DGX Spark. Research organizations around the world, including the NYU Global Frontier Lab, previewed DGX Spark to boost their AI development. “DGX Spark allows us to access peta-scale computing on our desktop,” said Kyunghyun Cho, professor of computer and data science at the NYU Global Frontier Lab. “This new way to conduct AI research and development enables us to rapidly prototype and experiment with advanced AI algorithms and models — even for privacy- and security-sensitive applications, such as healthcare.” NVIDIA DGX Spark Now Shipping Starting Wednesday, Oct. 15, DGX Spark can be ordered on NVIDIA.com. Partner systems will be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI as well as Micro Center stores in the U.S., and from NVIDIA channel partners worldwide.
