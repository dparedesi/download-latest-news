Title: Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/will-nvidia-nvda-stock-hit-500-by-2030/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:18:03Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable. There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though? The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable. Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short. As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever. Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options. If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors? From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home. In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending. Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999. The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China. If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.” The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests. It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders. Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside. Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat. All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor. Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: QYLD Turns Mag 7 Tech Stocks Into an 11% Dividend Yield
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/qyld-turns-mag-7-tech-stocks-into-an-11-dividend-yield/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:48:19Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) transforms the Nasdaq-100’s top technology stocks into an 11% monthly dividend by selling covered call options against its holdings. Unlike traditional dividend ETFs, QYLD generates income exclusively through option premiums. The fund sells near-the-money call options on its entire portfolio each month, collecting premiums from buyers who purchase the right to buy shares at specific strike prices. This strategy produces consistent monthly income but caps upside participation when tech stocks rally sharply. The fund’s $8 billion portfolio concentrates heavily in technology at 57% of the total ETF, and communication services at 17%. The top holdings – Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms – represent over half the fund and drive most option premium generation. QYLD’s 11.5% yield depends entirely on market volatility, not underlying dividends. The fund’s top holdings pay minimal natural yields: NVDA offers just 0.02%, AAPL 0.37%, and MSFT 0.70%. Amazon pays no dividend. This means QYLD’s monthly distributions fluctuate based on option premium levels, which compress during low-volatility periods. Recent dividend history reveals declining payouts. Monthly distributions averaged $0.198 in 2021 but have dropped 17% to approximately $0.169 currently. This decline reflects lower implied volatility in tech stocks as markets stabilized following pandemic-era swings. When volatility decreases, call options command lower premiums, directly reducing QYLD’s distributable income. The fund’s structure also creates total return concerns. While delivering high current income, QYLD’s net asset value has eroded 23% from its December 2021 peak of $22.82 to the current $17.54. This capital depreciation occurs because covered calls cap participation in bull market rallies. When tech stocks surge—as they did throughout 2023-2024—QYLD surrenders upside gains beyond strike prices. Investors receive steady income but miss appreciation that Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) holders capture fully. The concentration in highly valued tech stocks adds risk. NVDA trades at 46 times earnings with a beta of 2.28, creating extreme volatility that generates premiums but exposes the fund to sharp drawdowns. The April 2025 drop to $14.48 demonstrated this downside vulnerability. Income reliability remains strong—QYLD has paid monthly since 2013 without interruption. However, distribution amounts fluctuate with market conditions, and the declining trend suggests caution for investors expecting stable 11% yields indefinitely. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPI) offers a more diversified approach to option income generation. Rather than concentrating in tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, JEPI writes calls on a broader S&P 500-based portfolio with lower volatility stocks. The fund currently yields approximately 7.4% with more stable monthly distributions and less exposure to mega-cap tech concentration risk. JEPI combines equity-linked notes with covered calls, providing flexibility to adjust option strategies based on market conditions while maintaining consistent income generation.

Title: Pro-AI super PAC launches first candidate ads | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/tech/pro-ai-super-pac-launches-first-candidate-ads
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:24:51Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A new pro-AI network of political action committees is releasing its first candidate ads in the 2026 midterms, as the debate around artificial intelligence ramps up ahead of the elections. The ads from Leading the Future, a pro-AI bipartisan network of associated PACs, focus on congressional races in Texas and New York and are a likely preview of the vast amounts of money the technology industry could spend ahead of next year’s elections. The ads were shared first with CNN. Leading the Future said these ads are the “opening phase” of its effort in the upcoming midterm elections; the two ads are part of seven-figure ad campaign for the respective primaries, with more to come, the group told CNN. Other groups are also breaking out their wallets: Two former members of Congress, Democrat Brad Carson and Republican Chris Stewart, have joined forces to create a new organization called Public First, and network of super PACs that will back efforts and candidates who want to regulate AI. Meta recently launched its own bipartisan super PAC called American Technology Excellence Project, which aims in part to counter efforts to regulate AI at the state level. The stakes are enormous: In just a few years, AI has become a major driver of the US stock market and a force in the economy, as well as a major player in people’s everyday lives. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first $5 trillion company earlier this year after demand for its products surged. Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Oracle, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech companies have poured billions of dollars into hiring, research and development of AI products, looking for ways to secure a lead in the AI race and dominate a still-growing market. But critics say the rush to build ever-more complex AI models carries enormous risks in areas like privacy and child safety, with a regulatory framework that lags far behind the rapid advances in technology. And even some tech pioneers warn that AI poses potential dangers to the economy and to the world. Recent polling from the Pew Research Center released in November shows nearly identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats say they are more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life. And in September, Gallup found 80% of US adults “believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly.” Leading the Future advocates for a federal regulatory framework on AI instead of state level regulations – a policy favored by the industry and President Donald Trump’s administration. On Monday, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level in favor of a federal level “rulebook,” though it’s not clear what that would look like. The Trump administration argues state regulations threaten to stymie America’s AI industry, which is a national security priority. Congress could take up a possible framework for AI regulation within the next year – House Democrats announced on Tuesday they are setting up a Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy to “develop policy expertise in partnership” with AI companies and other stakeholders. Leading the Future’s new ads underscore this divide, with one ad in support of a Texas candidate and another targeting a New York candidate. One ad supports Chris Gober, a lawyer running in the Republican primary for the new Texas 10th congressional district. The ad calls Gober, who previously worked with Elon Musk on his America Super PAC as well as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a stalwart “Trump conservative.” Though the ad is paid for by American Mission, part of Leading the Future’s network, it does not mention AI directly, only referring to “promoting American technology investment” in the race to beat China. Gober told CNN in an email that he’s running to “champion” the “world-class innovators” in his district and to promote policies “that ensure America wins the global technology race.” The second ad targets New York State Assemblyman Alex Bores, who is running in New York’s 12th congressional district and has made a name for himself as an outspoken voice for AI safety guardrails. And unlike Gober’s ad, the ad targeting Bores from Leading the Future’s Think Big PAC leans heavily into criticizing Bores for wanting to regulate AI at the state level. In response, Bores criticized President Trump’s recent actions on AI and what he called a “handful of AI billionaires” angry because he “would dare to stand up to them to protect our jobs, our kids’ minds, and our security.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Big Bubbles Are Not Deterring Bullish Investors

Almost nothing seems to rattle individual investors lately. They’ve overcome fears about tariffs, inflation, and a potential stock market bubble, continuing to buy their favorite stocks and ETFs all year long. Despite concerns about economic policy, overvaluations in AI stocks, and rising prices, investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market right now, according to Investopedia’s recent survey. More than 60% describe themselves as either optimistic or cautiously optimistic, while less than a third say they are skeptical or hesitant. The late November selloff across the biggest stocks in the market—like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Palantir (PLTR)—did not deter investor optimism. In fact, it may have emboldened them to buy more, adding to their positions in the most widely held stocks in their investors’ portfolios. According to the Schwab Trading Activity Index, or STAX, Schwab clients took advantage of the drawdowns in those mega-cap stocks and bought the dip at one of the fastest paces in history. They did so even though the majority of respondents to our survey think that AI-related stocks are in a bubble, and nearly half feel the same way about the biggest tech stocks in the market. More than half also believe cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are frothy, despite the 25% decline in the price of Bitcoin over the past month. Investors have had plenty to be concerned about throughout 2025. Whether it was the Trump administration’s initially aggressive tariff policies, the rise of Chinese AI model DeepSeek, geopolitical instability in places like the Middle East and Ukraine, or the reliability of government data, headline risk has been the standard all year long. While this may have contributed to increased volatility in the stock market in recent months compared to the past few years, individual investors have mostly stayed the course with their investment strategies. They pulled back slightly on their investing plans during the tariff tantrums last April, but have steadily returned to their normal allocations across the stock market. Concerns about recent market events have also been dissipating, a sign that investors have grown accustomed to more uncertainty. While individual investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market and their portfolios, their trust in this administration continues to wane, and their concerns that its policies will hurt their investments continue to rise. Still, most believe in the relentless rise of the stock market, regardless of who might occupy the Oval Office, and expect annual returns of at least 5% over the next three years. That’s lower than the average annual returns of 14% for the S&P 500 over the past five years, but still optimistic. In yet another sign of investors’ optimism and risk tolerance, most would choose to invest an extra $10,000—if they had it—in individual stocks. They’ve benefitted from owning many of the biggest and fastest-rising stocks in the market for the past several years, and expect that trend to continue for the next decade. Individual investors' portfolios closely mirror the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500, or the top holdings in popular ETFs such as VOO (VOO), SPY (SPY), and QQQ (QQQ). They’ve remained loyal to these stocks, which include the Magnificent 7, as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). Many have become millionaires owning these stocks and have continued to buy them throughout this bull market, which began over three years ago. Their faith in these giant stocks is so strong that not only are they their biggest holdings today, but most would buy and hold the same group of stocks for the next decade. Old habits die hard—especially when the bull keeps running.

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Broadcom Stock to Move After Earnings

Broadcom (AVGO) is slated to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with traders expecting the chipmaker's stock could hit fresh record highs after the report. Based on current options pricing, Broadcom stock is expected to rise or fall by up to 6% by the end of the week. Based on Monday's closing price, that would lift Broadcom's stock to around $425 on the high end, further past the intraday record of $407 the stock set on Monday, or push it down to about $377. Last quarter, Broadcom's revenue hit a record $15.95 billion as the company topped estimates, prompting some analysts to call Broadcom a "Magnificent 8" stock that could continue to grow alongside Nvidia (NVDA) if the AI industry keeps expanding. Broadcom stock rallied following the report, setting multiple record highs in the months since. Broadcom designs AI chips used by several big tech companies—including Google, Meta and OpenAI—to train and run AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Broadcom stock has been less affected than shares of other tech giants by the recent concerns over an AI bubble. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © pestoverde / Flickr Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is pushing higher on a report from Truth Social that the tech giant could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and other high-demand areas. All under the condition that a quarter of sales be paid to the U.S. government. As a result, analysts at Bernstein just initiated an outperform rating on NVDA, noting that if reports are accurate, NVDA can ship chips to some customers in China, which is a positive development. Just yesterday, analysts at Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia, citing a significant opportunity with data centers. After all, artificial intelligence will continue to create massive demand for data centers. Right now, according to MIT Technology Review, there are about 3,000 data centers across the U.S. Plus, according to a report from McKinsey, $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure investments will be needed by 2030. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are down about $2.62 at the moment. However, Deutsche Bank analysts see more upside heading into earnings. The firm reiterated its buy rating on MU ahead of the company’s earnings on December 17, with a price target of $280, up from $200. The firm believes MU is well-positioned to benefit from the memory cycle, with HBM driving structural changes in the semiconductor industry. And down, but not out, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are being viewed positively by analysts at Needham. The firm has a buy rating on NFLX and doesn’t believe it needs Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the firm, “NFLX buying WBD would put $83B of additional value at risk of being disrupted by GenAI. Without WBD, NFLX is more global, more nimble, more tech-first, and has more flexibility with the Hollywood unions (called Guilds),” as quoted by CNBC. Just the other day, Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on NFLX. The firm noted, “We acknowledge that NFLX shares have been largely reactive to recent developments re: potential strategic outcomes. But we believe Netflix’s long-term fundamental outlook is increasingly strengthening, thanks to its highly compelling value proposition, its excellent execution track record, and its improved global, competitive positioning,” as quoted by CNBC.

Stock futures are holding steady as investors await the Federal Reserve's final decision of the year on interest rates; the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting today, weighing signs that the labor market is weakening against lingering concerns about inflation; Nvidia will be allowed to sell its H200 chips to companies in China, with 25% of revenue going to the U.S. government; the European Union is investigating Google's use of online data to train its AI models; and Home Depot shares are falling as the company issued an outlook for 2026 that came in below analysts' expectations. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are hovering near unchanged this morning ahead of the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated decision on interest rates, which is due Wednesday afternoon. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the benchmark S&P 500 were up less than 0.1% recently, while those linked to the the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. The major indexes each declined Monday after ending last week near record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was unchanged from yesterday's close at 4.17%, near its highest level in more than two months. Bitcoin was trading at $90,600, up from an overnight low of $89,500. Gold futures were up 0.3% at $4,230 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 0.2% to around $59 per barrel. The Federal Reserve's policy committee is scheduled to convene its two-day meeting today, with a decision on interest rates coming at the end of the gathering. The Fed is widely expected to lower its benchmark fed funds rate for the third consecutive meeting. In addition to awaiting the decision, market participants are eager to see the quarterly projections from committee members on key economic indicators and rates, and to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed, which is trying to balance fears about a weakening labor market against concerns that inflation remains too high, will get an important piece of data on Tuesday with the release of the Job Openings & Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for October. Nvidia (NVDA) got some good news Monday afternoon, when President Donald Trump said that his administration will allow Nvidia to sell its older generation of artificial intelligence GPUs, the H200, to "approved customers" in China, with a 25% cut going to the U.S. government. The Trump and Biden administrations each had concerns about Nvidia and other chipmakers selling their most advanced products to companies in China, amid worries that there could be national security risks in letting China develop its own AI models with the technology. Earlier this year, Nvidia agreed to give the government 15% of sales of its lower-powered H20 chip in China, but the plans fell apart when the Chinese government told companies not to buy them because of its own security concerns with bringing in American products with government involvement. Nvidia shares were up about 1% in recent premarket trading. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is the subject of a new probe from the European Commission, as the enforcement arm of the European Union will investigate whether Google acted anticompetitively by using online content and YouTube videos to train its AI models. The Commission is "concerned" that Google is using content from online publishers to create the "AI Overviews" at the top of search results pages without proper compensation and offering unfair terms when it does compensate, and that it is giving its own AI models "privileged access" to online content, putting other companies looking to train AI models at a disadvantage. The investigation is the latest in the region's antitrust push against big tech companies. The EU last week announced a probe into whether Meta Platforms (META) is violating antitrust law with policies prohibiting other AI companies from interacting with users in WhatsApp, potentially giving an advantage to its own chatbot Meta AI. Home Depot (HD) shares are moving lower Tuesday morning after the home improvement retail giant provided a lackluster outlook for next year ahead of its annual investor day. Expecting the broader home improvement market to either decline by up to 1% or grow by up to 1% next year, Home Depot said it expects its own total sales to grow by 2.5% to 4.5%. That compares with the consensus analyst forecast of 4.3%, according to Visible Alpha. Home Depot's adjusted earnings per share and comparable sales growth forecasts also came in short of what analysts expected. The retailer said it expects sales and profits to grow once the housing market picks up and "pent-up demand" for home improvement projects can be realized, and said it expects to continue growing faster than the larger home improvement market and its competitors. Home Depot shares were down nearly 3% before the opening bell.

Nvidia stock today: Nvidia shares jumped about 2% after President Trump approved H200 AI chip sales to China with a 25% revenue share to the US. The move restores access to a market that once drove 20–25% of Nvidia’s data-center sales. Xi Jinping responded positively. NVDA is up nearly 40% this year, easing major policy uncertainty and boosting long-term optimism.

Title: Nvidia-Backed CoreWeave's Stock Slumps. Here's What's Behind Monday's Slide
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-backed-coreweave-stock-slumps-here-is-what-is-behind-monday-slide-crwv-11864028
Time Published: 2025-12-08T19:18:50Z
Full Content:
Shares of CoreWeave (CRWV) lost ground Monday after the cloud computing company said it would sell $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The shares were down close to 5% in recent trading. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The data center provider backed by AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said the convertible senior notes coming due in 2031 will be made in a private offering, and initial investors would have the option to purchase an additional $300 million worth within a 13-day period from the issuance date. Convertible debt offerings can offer a relatively simple and inexpensive way for companies to raise capital. However, existing shareholders may view them negatively, as they can be dilutive and may raise concerns about a company's debt levels. CoreWeave said that a portion of the proceeds will be used for capped call transactions, with the rest for general corporate purposes. The move comes after a recent pullback in CoreWeave's shares amid worries about an AI bubble, after a big run-up in its stock following its public debut in March. Even with CoreWeave's recent losses, the stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price.
