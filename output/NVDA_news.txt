Title: An Intel Break-Up Could Follow Its CEO Shake-Up, Bank of America Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/intel-break-up-could-follow-ceo-shake-up-bank-of-america-stock-8753963
Time Published: 2024-12-02T21:27:24Z

Intel (INTC) could break up its operations after CEO Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement was announced Monday, according to Bank of America analysts. The analysts wrote Monday that Intel's internal manufacturing business and the foundry business that makes chips for other companies are now more likely to be separated, as the outgoing CEO was a proponent of keeping them together. Such a shake-up would still face a number of hurdles, like the strings attached to the nearly $8 billion in federal CHIPS Act funding announced last week. The BofA analysts said that the funding agreement dictates that Intel needs to retain at least a 35% stake in its foundry business. "Both businesses are undergoing their own strategic, structural, financial, and competitive issues, with no near term solution in sight," the analysts wrote, maintaining their "underperform" rating and $21 price target on the shares. Intel's stock finished Monday slightly lower. While Intel shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year, some of the company's few bright spots have come from reports of potential investments or acquisition offers, or after the chipmaker sold pieces of some assets. Bloomberg and Reuters reported Monday that Gelsinger met with the chipmaker's board last week over its concerns about the company's turnaround effort and its progress in catching up to competitors like Nvidia (NVDA)‚Äîand allegedly was given the choice to retire or be fired.

Title: AI Is All Picks And Shovels, No Gold

Time Published: 2024-12-02T20:53:57Z

When it comes to AI you may be better off betting on the the suppliers‚Äîthe ‚Äúpick and shovel‚Äù ... [+] providers. Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock‚Äîalong with the sell offs‚Äîfor almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived‚Äîlike the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today‚Äôs almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns: This last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI? AI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM‚Äôs Watson to ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to mimic human conversation, we‚Äôve come a long way in ‚Äúnarrow AI‚Äù advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of ‚Äúgeneral AI‚Äù‚Äîa system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that. Why is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you‚Äôll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain‚Äîrunning on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists‚Äîis still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While ‚Äúbreakthroughs‚Äù dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists‚Äîthe coders‚Äîtinker with existing frameworks. But you can‚Äôt invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the ‚Äúpick and shovel‚Äù providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, ‚ÄúWhen everyone is looking for gold, it‚Äôs a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.‚Äù Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high‚Äîfueled by a fear of being left behind‚Äîthe pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don‚Äôt think this trend can continue indefinitely. At its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense‚Äîembedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience‚Äîremains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy. Here are two early warning signals I have used as AI sell triggers: DeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth‚Äôs pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Great Enlightenment‚Äîthat forces a reevaluation of today‚Äôs runaway spending‚Äîhas begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum. While riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard. Disclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.

After an independent review revealing no board or audit committee misbehavior, Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financials) shares soared about 30% on Monday. The Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) partner will replace its CFO in line with improvements in governance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Initiated after auditor Ernst & Young resignation for governance and internal control issues, the special committee's review found no need for financial restatements. Since then, Super Micro has hired BDO USA as its new auditor and sent Nasdaq a compliance report meant to stop delisting. Over three months, the assessment turned significant procedural flaws but no proof supporting Ernst & Young's claims. Former vice president of finance Kenneth Cheung has been appointed chief accounting officer per committee recommendations. To improve governance, the business intends to name a new general counsel, chief compliance officer, and chief financial officer. Super Micro does not plan to restate financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 or other years; it intends to achieve Nasdaq's listing criteria within the discretionary time. Super Micro has been especially close to Nvidia, incorporating its GPUs into its server systems to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning uses. This cooperation has improved Super Micro's standing in the market for artificial intelligence servers. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Intel‚Äôs Turnaround CEO Pat Gelsinger Steps Down, Ending a Long Tenure at the Chipmaker

Time Published: 2024-12-02T18:26:13Z

After nearly four years of attempting to turn around Intel‚Äôs struggling semiconductor business, Pat Gelsinger is out as the company‚Äôs CEO. His resignation ends a tenure marked by plunging profits and a failure to capitalize on the A.I. boom that lifted rivals like Nvidia. ‚ÄúWe know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù said Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board member who will act as its interim executive chair in light of Gelsinger‚Äôs departure, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.‚Äù Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Gelsinger, 63, stepped down as CEO and left Intel‚Äôs board effective yesterday (Dec. 1), the chipmaker announced today in a press release. David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, two senior Intel executives, will act as co-CEOs while the company‚Äôs board works to find a permanent successor. Zinsner is currently the company‚Äôs executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of head of Intel Products and will oversee its client computing, data center and A.I., and network groups. Intel shares rose 4 percent today in response to the news. The resignation caps more than 30 years at Intel for Gelsinger, who first joined the company as a teenager in 1979 and went on to become its first chief technology officer at the turn of the century before leaving Intel in 2009. After taking a senior position at the tech company EMC and serving as the CEO of the cloud computing player VMware, Gelsinger in 2021 returned to Intel to take over from then-CEO Bob Swan. Despite ambitions to regain Intel‚Äôs leadership in the semiconductor industry, the company in recent years has failed to catch up with competitors and has seen its share price plunge by about 50 percent in 2024 alone. At the center of Gelsinger‚Äôs turnaround plan was a strategy to branch into contract manufacturing to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier to U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and Qualcomm. In the meantime, the company has also pivoted to making A.I. accelerators to compete with industry leaders like Nvidia, but with little success‚ÄîIntel‚Äôs current market cap is only 3 percent of Nvidia‚Äôs. Intel is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Biden administration‚Äôs Chips and Science Act, which is awarding the company nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants to expand its domestic manufacturing network‚Äîabout a quarter of Intel‚Äôs cost of goods sold in 2023. Gelsinger‚Äôs ousting also came amid rumblings of activist investor interest in Intel. The company, which in October reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, reportedly tapped advisors like Morgan Stanley (MS) earlier this year to defend itself from activist pressure. ‚ÄúToday is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,‚Äù said Gelsinger in a statement. ‚ÄúIt has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.‚Äù We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The tech-driven Nasdaq reached a high on Monday, driven by gains by Intel and Tesla (TSLA-1.61%), getting December off to a good start after a November that was the best month of 2024 for both the Dow and S&P 500. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.27% and the Nasdaq climbed 1%. This week, investors will see a diverse range of earnings reports from tech, meme stock, and entertainment companies. Salesforce (CRM+0.07% is set to release its earnings report Tuesday after the market closes. GameStop (GME+0.57%), a popular meme stock, will also report earnings Wednesday, and Lululemon (LULU+1.85%), which has been facing challenges due to sluggish sales, will report its earnings Thursday after the closing bell. In addition, the November jobs report will be released later this week. Shares of Intel (INTC-6.08% jumped 5% as the company announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel Corp. (INTC, Financials) announced that co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus would succeed Pat Gelsinger, who will retire on Dec. 1. Gelsinger also left Intel's board. INTC stock is up 4% in Monday morning trading following the news. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MU. Holthaus will also assume the newly established Intel Products CEO post. Frank Yeary is designated temporary executive chair. Intel is trying to become more competitive in semiconductor production and negotiate continuous obstacles, including pressure on its foundry operations, hence the leadership transition comes as natural. Previously running Intel's Client Computing Group, Holthaus will concentrate on centralizing resources for the product group. Joined Intel in 2022 Zinsner, a former executive vice president and CFO of Micron Technology (MU, Financials). KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts said that the action would show Intel's readiness to sell its foundry business, a prospect considered positive by some investors. Analyzers also pointed out the difficulties in selecting a leader suited to handle Intel's wide-ranging problems. Intel has had challenges growing its foundry operations to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM, Financials) and understood pressure from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD, Financials) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) in artificial intelligence. Aiming to save $10 billion in expenses and simplify operations, the business announced in August a 15% personnel cut. Intel reported a net loss of $0.46 per share in the most recent quarter as income dropped 6.2% year over year to $13.28 billion. Foundry income fell 8% to $4.4 billion during the same time frame. Part of its cost-cutting initiatives, the corporation also noted a $2.8 billion restructuring expense. Under the CHIPs Act, Intel this week earned a $7.86 billion grant, a drop from an earlier $8.5 billion allocation to improve manufacturing headquartered in the United States. Intel has not made any further strategic announcements after the CEO shift. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Intel (INTC-6.08%) shares climbed by over 4% during mid-day trading on Monday after the company announced that its chief executive is out. After over four decades at the chip pioneer, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger retired from the company and stepped down from its board of directors on Sunday, Intel said. Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner and chief executive of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus will now serve as interim co-CEOs while Intel‚Äôs board looks for another leader. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel‚Äôs board, will become its interim executive chair. ‚ÄúWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù Yeary said in a statement. Intel‚Äôs shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company‚Äôs (TSM+2.33%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm‚Äôs (ARM+0.05%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger‚Äôs stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA+1.15%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel‚Äôs Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion ‚Äî less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon ‚Äî an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired effective Dec. 1 and stepped down from the company's board of directors. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. Intel stock was up roughly 5% on the news midday before reversing direction. Shares fell as much as 2% in afternoon trading. A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that the board had lost confidence in Gelsinger and a change was needed ahead of 2025. The person added the decision was made by a small group of people inside Intel, and the leadership team was only made aware Sunday afternoon. It's unclear if Intel will continue with Gelsinger's expensive expansion into making chips for other companies, the source said. Intel has named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. The company said its board has formed a search committee and ‚Äúwill work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù Intel's board chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Intel is facing two separate lawsuits filed this year by investors claiming they were misled about the company's financial performance. The latest was filed by a pension fund in August following the chipmaker's announcement that it would slash 15,000 jobs. Gelsinger had previously spent 30 years at Intel but left in 2009. He rejoined the company in 2021, taking over the role of chief executive from Bob Swan. Gelsinger promised that his tenure would bring back a ‚ÄúGrovian‚Äù mindset to the company and right years of missteps that saw Intel lose its edge in the chip market to artificial intelligence chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA) and chip manufacturing giant TSMC (TSM). That goal referred to former CEO Andy Grove, who oversaw a spectacular turnaround for the company in the 1980s when Intel struggled to maintain its dominance in the memory chip market amid competition from Japan ‚Äî and made a dramatic shift toward producing another kind of chip, called CPUs, of which it became the leading manufacturer. Many of the problems facing Intel predate Gelsinger's tenure and will remain a challenge for its next leadership group. Intel is grappling with a slump in PC chip sales that‚Äôs only just beginning to improve and increased competition in that market from AMD (AMD) and British chip designer Arm (ARM), all while the CPU market as a whole is threatened by the rise of GPU chips, which are used to run generative artificial intelligence ‚Äî a market dominated by Nvidia. As Intel CEO, Gelsinger sought to bolster the company's foundry business by making chips for external customers. Intel makes its own chips but had never produced semiconductors for external customers, and its own chipmaking processes faced delays beginning in the mid-2010s. Gelsinger undertook aggressive efforts to improve Intel's manufacturing processes ‚Äî which he outlined at the start of his time as CEO in 2021 ‚Äî that aimed to reverse the foundry's former failures in five years. Intel has recently focused on upgrading to a manufacturing process called 18A that would allow it to directly compete with TSMC as a producer of AI chips. Gelsinger's departure casts doubt on the company's focus on its service foundry, which could affect Intel's ability to catch up in the AI space, according to analysts. "[W]hile keeping [the foundries] feels like deadweight (and a continuation of the strategy that got Pat out), scrapping them would also be fraught with difficulties around the product roadmap, outsourcing strategy, CHIPS act, and political navigation," Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note Monday. In late November, Intel was officially awarded $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding for its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also recently announced plans to split its foundry business into an independent subsidiary, and Gelsinger's exit could accelerate that change, according to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri. The move toward Intel's money-losing chip manufacturing business has so far failed to bolster faith in the company. Intel has recently become a takeover target, and shares of the company are down more than 50% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 26%. Intel stock was recently replaced by Nvidia in the Dow. As Bernstein's Rasgon wrote, "There don‚Äôt seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride."

Manage your account Intel (INTC) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest ‚Äî including a potential takeover bid ‚Äî as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel‚Äôs board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company‚Äôs mission to simplify and strengthen Intel‚Äôs product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. ‚ÄúWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù Yeary said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,‚Äù Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company‚Äôs shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize ‚Äî and stabilize ‚Äî the company, to little avail. ‚ÄúIt has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,‚Äù Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the ‚Äúmost consequential changes‚Äù in the company‚Äôs history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA).

Some shore. Any shore will do. At this point, the island on which 14 NFL playoff teams will reside five weeks from ... 'So easy to set up and use, I wish I'd gotten this years ago': Fans say the streaming gadget has made cord-cutting painless. Russia is landing military aircraft on newly refurbished runways under its control in Libya as the Kremlin quickly expands its footprint in Africa, satellite images show. Since leaving his post as Microsoft CEO in 2000, Bill Gates has become one of the world's most visible philanthropists.

Meta stock could be one of the best buys in the artificial intelligence industry right now. "Find a way to add at least one, maybe two or three of these companies, because these are so much part of what drives the economy and the market." Finding strong, market-beating stocks with a positive earnings outlook becomes easier with the Zacks Rank. Dividend stocks can be terrific investments. In addition to generating dividend income, they have historically produced strong total returns. The average dividend stock in the S&P 500 has delivered a 9.2% average annual total return over the last 50 years compared to a 4.3% return for nonpayers, according to data from Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research. These stocks can prove to be smart picks in the new year. Chinese chip companies targeted by Washington with fresh export controls have vowed to speed up supply chain localisation and said they would be able to continue production thanks to recent efforts to build equipment stockpiles. Empyrean, a maker of electronic design automation (EDA) tools also known as Beijing Huada Jiutian Technology, said its inclusion on the list would have little impact on operations. "The company will seize the development opportunity to accelerate the localisation process of full-process EDA tools," it said in a stock market statement. Strategic funding and NVIDIA partnership spark a 15% pre-market jump, positioning Nebius as an AI powerhouse. The past couple of years have been terrific for stocks, with the benchmark S&P 500 index up a whopping 57.1% since the end of 2022. The average stock in the S&P 500 index offers a yield of just 1.2%, but Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI) offer more than 6% at recent prices. Here's why adding them to a diversified portfolio now makes a lot of sense for most income-seeking investors. Pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) has had a strong year, with its stock price up about 30% as of this writing, while also paying out a very attractive distribution. Let's look at three reasons why investors should consider buying Enterprise Products Partners' stock at current levels. The first thing to note when looking at Enterprise as a long-term investment is that the master limited partnership (MLP) has an unparalleled track record of consistency in the midstream energy space. Super Micro Computer shares soared Monday after the computer server maker said an independent review of its accounting practices found no wrongdoing. This projection assumes that the capital expenditures being poured into AI training hardware will set the stage for the adoption of software solutions that make life easier for businesses and their consumers. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is up 26.8% through Dec. 2, and certain sectors are doing even better. Investment management firm Vanguard has an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the performance of the S&P 500's communications sector. The Vanguard Communications ETF (NYSEMKT: VOX) is up 33.4% at the time of this writing, and there's reason to believe the fund is still a great value for investors interested in communications stocks like Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Warren Buffett amassed a huge fortune investing in individual businesses. In 2019, he added exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett owns one Vanguard ETF that could be poised to plunge, according to a top Wall Street analyst. These great stocks have what it takes to bounce back and deliver wins for investors. As global markets continue to reach record highs, with indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index climbing steadily, investors are keenly observing how geopolitical factors and domestic policies shape economic sentiment. In this environment of cautious optimism, dividend stocks stand out as a potential source of reliable income, offering stability through regular payouts even amidst market fluctuations. Electricity demand is expected to surge in the coming years, fueled by a multitude of catalysts, including the electrification of the transportation sector and AI data centers. The smartest way to play this coming surge is investing in master limited partnerships (MLPs) with meaningful gas infrastructure operations. Since MLPs currently trade at lower valuations than pipeline corporations, they offer higher yields and total return potential. Art Cashin, a renowned market pundit and the UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange, has died at the age of 83, UBS said. Cashin, once dubbed "Wall Street's version of Walter Cronkite" by The Washington Post, was a regular on CNBC, delivering stock market commentary and analysis to the business news channel's viewers for more than 25 years. "It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of the passing of Arthur Cashin, Jr., a true giant in our industry," Bill Carroll, head of sales and development at UBS Wealth Management USA, said in a memo sent to employees on Monday. In President-elect Donald Trump's 20-point Agenda 47, his official platform of policies for his second stay in the White House, No. 14 promises to protect Social Security. But there are still many... Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs troubles at Intel show that boards would rather take big swings than hope for the best.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years.

Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Nvidia (NVDA) announced its new AI audio model, Fugatto, this week that can generate or transform ‚Äúany mix of music, voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.‚Äù Fugatto is short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, Nvidia said. With the new model, users can enter a text prompt and generate a music snippet, remove or add instruments to an already existing song, change accents or emotions in a voice, and ‚Äúproduce sounds never heard before.‚Äù ‚ÄúFugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties ‚Äî capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities ‚Äî and the ability to combine free-form instructions,‚Äù Nvidia said. Anthropic announced new updates to its Claude AI chatbot this week. With the new Google (GOOGL) Docs integration, Claude can use context from a user‚Äôs documents to improve the relevance and accuracy of its responses, Anthropic said. Claude can summarize long documents and ‚Äúreference historical context‚Äù from Google Docs files. The integration is available for Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. Claude‚Äôs new styles feature allows users to customize how the chatbot responds to follow a preferred communication style and work requirements. Users can choose a formal, concise, or explanatory style. Claude can also generate custom styles from uploaded sample content. Anthropic also added the ability to add global profile preferences for the chatbot to instruct it ‚Äúon things you always want it to keep in mind,‚Äù such as a preferred coding language. AI agents startup /dev/agents came out of stealth mode this week and announced a $56 million seed round. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and CapitalG. The startup, which is building an operating system for AI agents, was founded by former Stripe chief technology officer David Singleton, and former vice presidents at Google and Meta (META): Hugo Barra, Ficus Kirkpatrick, and Nicholas Jitkoff. ‚ÄúToday you can build an AI demo in hours, but getting something consumers can actually trust with their credit card is nearly impossible,‚Äù Singleton said. ‚ÄúJust as Android made mobile development accessible to virtually any developer, we‚Äôre building the platform that will help make AI agents mainstream.‚Äù Runway announced its new base model for image generation, Frames, this week. The new model represents ‚Äúa big step forward in stylistic control and visual fidelity,‚Äù the AI startup, which develops multimodal AI systems for video, image, and audio generation, said. Frames can maintain stylistic consistency when generating images, Runway said. Access to Frames is rolling out in its Gen-3 Alpha foundation model and through Runway‚Äôs API. Visual AI platform Luma launched its first image generation model, Luma AI Photon Image Model, this week. The text-to-image foundation model was built on Luma‚Äôs Universal Transformer architecture. The model is 800% faster and cheaper than other models, Luma said. Luma also announced a free and subscription-based service for its Dream Machine visual AI service on the web and iOS. The Dream Machine model was released in June and has 25 million registered users.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Here's a juicy bit of tech history: Back in 2013, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) legendary founder Morris Chang asked Nvidia's (NVDA) Jensen Huang to take over as CEO. It wasn't just a casual pitch. Chang laid out a 10-minute vision for Taiwan Semiconductor's future, convinced Huang's industry smarts and leadership chops made him the perfect successor. But Huang? He shut it down, quick, with a polite, I already have a job. That job, of course, was running Nvidia. And oh, how that decision paid off. Nvidia exploded into the AI juggernaut it is today, while Taiwan Semiconductor thrived under new leadership, cementing itself as the chipmaking kingpin for giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with TSM. This moment is more than just a fun anecdoteit's a masterclass in leadership and strategy. Huang's decision to stick with Nvidia wasn't just loyalty; it was foresight. By doubling down on Nvidia's potential, he steered the company to a $1 trillion market cap, driven by insatiable AI demand. Meanwhile, Chang's knack for partnerships and market positioning turned Taiwan Semiconductor into the semiconductor backbone of the digital economy. It's no coincidence these two companies remain tethered, with Taiwan Semiconductor producing Nvidia's cutting-edge chips. Their trajectories highlight the power of staying the course and playing to your strengthsa lesson Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now trying to catch up on as it chases the foundry crown. For investors, this is a clear signal: Leadership decisions aren't just boardroom dramathey're market movers. Chang and Huang's mutual respect and strategic brilliance laid the groundwork for today's AI and semiconductor boom. Nvidia's rise in AI and Taiwan Semiconductor's dominance in chipmaking didn't happen by luckit happened because of visionary calls like these. The takeaway? Bet on the leaders who see not just the game ahead but the game-changing partnerships that will take them there. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio
