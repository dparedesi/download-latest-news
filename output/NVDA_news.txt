Days after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off, a homegrown rival said its new AI model performed even better. Alibaba Cloud (BABA+5.39%) released an upgraded version of its flagship AI model, Qwen2.5-Max, that performed better than top open-source competitors, including DeepSeek’s V3 model and Meta’s (META+2.33%) Llama 3.1 model on various benchmarks, according to results published by the firm on WeChat. The cloud computing subsidiary of Alibaba Group also found its Qwen2.5-Max showed comparable performance to OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet — both closed-source models. The Chinese firm said its AI model “has demonstrated world-leading model performance in mainstream authoritative benchmarks,” including the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), which evaluates general knowledge, and LiveCodeBench, which tests coding skills. The Qwen2.5-Max announcement follows DeepSeek’s launch of its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week, which demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, O1-mini and O1, on several industry benchmarks, according to its technical paper. The release of DeepSeek-R1 prompted Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 futures to fall Monday morning. Nvidia’s (NVDA-2.74%) shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by the DeepSeek-R1 launch, which comes after the December release of DeepSeek-V3. While Alibaba Cloud hasn’t disclosed its development costs, DeepSeek’s claim that it built its model for just $5.6 million using Nvidia’s reduced-capability graphics processing units has caught the market’s attention, challenging assumptions about the massive investments needed for AI development. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek used a cluster of just under 2,050 Nvidia H800 chips for training its V3 model — a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100 that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. The cluster is also much smaller than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. DeepSeek’s release has called Big Tech’s tens of billions in spending on AI into question ahead of a slate of earnings results, as well as the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country.

Title: The paradox at the heart of the AI debate

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 7:50:24 AM PST by Red Badger Investors in energy stocks panicked this week over the release of a new, cheaper AI model, ignoring an argument that reducing the energy needs of such models could actually increase demand for energy overall. Why it matters: The news could end up being bullish for those stocks, which lost more than $40 billion in value on Monday. How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Title: DeepSeek: Lemon, It’s Wednesday
URL: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jzjph4yYtgAsLeWmg/deepseek-lemon-it-s-wednesday
Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:00:09Z
Full Content:
It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

Title: Microsoft thinks China's DeepSeek might have used OpenAI's tech before its big breakthrough

Microsoft (MSFT-5.86%) and OpenAI are investigating whether a group connected to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek accessed OpenAI’s data without permission, according to a new report. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Microsoft’s security team noticed unusual activity last fall in which individuals, believed to be linked to DeepSeek, accessed large amounts of data through OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The ChatGPT maker’s API allows software developers to license and use the company’s proprietary AI models into their own applications. However, the breach may have violated OpenAI’s terms of service and appeared to be an attempt to bypass restrictions on how much data can be accessed from the service. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, flagged the issue to the company, Bloomberg reports. Last week, the Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. At the same time, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.28%) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. The U.S. National Security Council is already reviewing the potential national security risks associated with DeepSeek, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Leavitt noted that President Donald Trump views the startup’s newly released AI model as a “wake-up call” for American developers. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led stocks lower on Wednesday morning as the broader mood stayed muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more 0.7%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will listen for answers to two key questions at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference: How much further will the Fed cut rates and has the central bank changed its stance in light of President Trump's early tariff moves? Meanwhile, a surprise rise in bookings for ASML (ASML), a key toolmaker in the AI chip chain, gave another boost to techs starting to recover from a bruising start to the week. Shares of ASML popped 5% in early trading, with peers like Applied Materials (AMAT) also making gains. Nvidia (NVDA), however, didn't catch a boost, with shares down nearly 5%, as its Tuesday comeback faltered. Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Nvidia (NVDA) stock tanked on Monday, falling more than 17% and losing nearly $600 billion off its market cap, as investors digested a new cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. But retail investors bought the dip. Data from VandaTrack shows retail investors bought more than $562 million of the name on Monday, the largest single day inflow into the stock in VandaTrack's data. On Tuesday, as the stock rebounded and rose roughly 9%, there was once again a large swath of retail buying totaling nearly $360 million. Across the two days of chaotic market action, retail investors sent more than $920 million into shares of Nvidia. Wall street strategists largely agreed with retail's bullish outlook on the name. "We think this is probably going to end up a buy the dip Nvidia moment," Fundstrat head of Research Tom Lee said in a video to clients on Monday night. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith the DeepSeek driven sell-off was "overblown." Rasgon added that the new developments don't spell out "doomsday for AI infrastructure." Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flat line. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line. And with Apple set to report results for its holiday quarter on Thursday — its most important quarter of the year for iPhone sales — Wall Street is bracing its clients for a mild disappointment.

We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction. To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Analyst Upside (as of January 27): 59% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA’s counterpart, specializes in manufacturing semiconductors, providing processors, and graphics solutions for gaming, data centers, and embedded systems, with a core focus on high-performance computing using AI use cases. Where NVDA led the AI boom in 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged over 35% in the last year. Earlier in December 2024, someone asked Jim Cramer if he was worried about AMD and the stock’s underperformance. Here is what Cramer said: “This is very difficult, and you’re absolutely right to bring it up, and I’m glad you did. Here’s the problem. It is absolutely true—it is absolutely true that they’re not doing as well as Nvidia. It is true that they do not have the big Amazon orders that I’ve been looking at. But can we just remember that Lisa Su has built an amazing company, taking a lot of shares from Intel? She got the number two when it comes to the data center, when it comes to AI, and come on, she just did the great deal where she got all these engineers to come in. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has transformed its business from a struggling company to a semiconductor leader, with its stock jumping from $3 to $115 over a decade, as of January 27. In 2024, AMD introduced the Instinct MI325X AI accelerators and next-generation networking solutions, focusing on strengthening its position in the AI data center market. The company’s majority of revenue comes from data center sales. In 2024, the company acquired ZT Systems for around $5 billion. The ZT Systems purchase will further help Advanced Micro Devices in improving its market share in AI data centers. During the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a revenue of $6.82 billion, up by 18% year-over-year and beating estimates by $104.33 million. The data center revenue accounted for $3.5 billion, up 122% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales. On January 21, Citi maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares and lowered the price target from $200 to $175. The firm expects a drop in semiconductor sales due to weaker demand in PC, automotive, and industrial markets. However, analysts project AMD’s data center business to expand, driven by AI sales. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeepSeek's AI breakthrough is calling Big Tech's big spending into question

Time Published: 2025-01-29T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Big Tech’s multi-billion dollar spending on artificial intelligence will be under investor scrutiny this week — even more so after China’s DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley with a cheap yet competitive AI model. Ahead of earnings results from Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, the AI-driven stock rally lost $1 trillion in value after the Hangzhou-based AI startup demonstrated AI reasoning models on par with OpenAI and Anthropic. Last week’s release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by DeepSeek, which in December released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta (META), for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. The tech giant and other U.S. rivals such as OpenAI have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company is planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and end up with more than 1.3 million GPUs. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced a new joint venture with tech heavyweights SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL) to invest $500 billion in building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Big Tech’s billions in spending on AI infrastructure — but it could also expand the market for AI. Despite questions over DeepSeek’s spending and distilled models, “there are a few clear breakthroughs which show the industry a path to cheaper means of both training and inference,” John Belton, a portfolio manager and analyst at Gabelli Funds, said in a statement shared with Quartz. Belton said DeepSeek’s methods raise questions of “great[er] innovation and therefore compute demand from Western customers,” who have more powerful chips than DeepSeek. Cheaper inferencing could expand the total-addressable-market, Belton said, as well as fulfill Jevon’s Paradox — the idea in economics that the more efficient it is to use a resource, the more likely consumption will increase. Meanwhile, cloud providers could see more demand as the cost of inferencing, or the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data, declines — also a “definite positive” for AI developers such as Meta, Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), Belton said. While Jefferies (JEF)’ analyst said in a note that they “still think there will be a significant capex ramp for AI,” the cost of inferencing needs to scale down to reach mass AI adoption. It’s plausible the efficiency will lead to more demand for hardware to train proprietary models, Mark Klein, chief executive of SuRo Capital (SSSS), said in a statement shared with Quartz, but developers are still unsure how DeepSeek’s approach can scale with larger chip clusters. In the near term, AI-focused chip companies will be “unlikely to see meaningful change” in demand due to DeepSeek, considering supply constraints with chips, data center capacity, and power, analysts at William Blair said in a note. “Longer term, however, the continued pressure to lower the cost of compute—and the ability to reduce the cost of training and inference using new, more efficient algorithmic techniques—could result in lower capex than previously envisioned,” the analysts said. This could lessen Nvidia’s dominance, William Blair analysts said, especially if companies realize they don’t need large-scale chip clusters for frontier models. However, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the world’s largest companies are not “going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.” “At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia,” Ives said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing.....launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Jefferies analysts agreed that Nvidia will be OK. “They were overvalued anyway considering that we are only in first generation of this technology,” a Jefferies analyst said in a note. “Even with less demand for giant GPU data centers, the demand for inference machines will be off the charts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump is turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President Donald Trump apparently has no qualms about turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war. When prompted by specific questions from reporters, the new president tossed out some of the biggest names in the tech world as possible buyers of TikTok’s US operations — a deal that would allow the platform to get around a ban imposed by Congress in the name of national security. Among the names floated so far by Trump are Elon Musk, owner of X; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL); and Microsoft (MSFT). It's not yet clear if any are involved in actual discussions. "I like bidding wars because you make your best deals," Trump said Monday as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump said he wants a deal done in 30 days. An executive order he signed on his first day in office actually gives TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, until April 4 to figure something out. Here is a closer look at the big names mentioned by Trump — and others who have also gone public with their bids: Microsoft, along with Walmart (WMT), made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump’s first term when Trump actually tried to ban the app. When asked Monday if Microsoft was among the companies interested this time around in an ownership stake, Trump answered in the affirmative: "I would say yes." It is not yet known whether Microsoft is actually involved in any talks. Microsoft’s prior bid in 2020 didn’t go anywhere. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later said after those discussions fell apart that the federal government had a "particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared." He called it the "strangest thing I've ever worked on." The Chinese government will certainly have a say in whatever happens. And government officials in that country, according to reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the social media app’s US business to Musk. Trump sounded intrigued by the idea when asked about it publicly. "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump said of Musk, the owner of X when a reporter at the White House wanted to know if he was in favor of such a deal. But Musk has not spoken on the subject yet, except to say on X, “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change." Antitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users. Another factor in his favor is that Musk has a close relationship with the incoming president, having spent more than $250 million supporting his reelection campaign and as he is helping lead a government cost-cutting effort as part of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He also runs an electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), that has a factory in China and sells a lot of its cars to that part of the world. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether Ellison could play a role in the TikTok situation. "I’d like Larry to buy it too," the president said last week, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment. "Larry, let’s negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on. "What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we’ll give you the permit. And they’ll have a great partner, the United States." "Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said. NPR later reported that the Trump administration was developing a plan that would move control of TikTok to Oracle, where Ellison is chair and chief technology officer, along with other outside investors. In that scenario, ByteDance would keep a minority stake in the company while Oracle would oversee the app’s algorithm and data collection. Oracle already acts as a service provider for TikTok, storing its videos and other content in data centers. But Trump denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject Sunday. "No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days." He also denied any actual discussions with Ellison, saying "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok." Another bidder in the mix not yet mentioned by Trump is Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by some Big Tech names: Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Nvidia (NVDA), and other venture capitalists. The AP reported this past weekend that Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance that would merge Perplexity with TikTok’s US business and then give half ownership in that new company to the US government following an initial public offering. The AP also reported that TikTok’s US business would be merged with Perplexity AI without the platform’s proprietary algorithm, and the existing investors in ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. One ByteDance board member, General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, told Axios last week during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that there could be a solution for TikTok that does not require a full divesture from ByteDance. General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), Sequoia Capital, and Susquehanna International Group are among the existing US investors in TikTok’s parent company. Former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who acknowledged last year he was assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok, said last weekend on Fox News’s "Sunday Morning Futures" that a new investor would "dilute down" Chinese ownership of TikTok. "I’d be very interested in participating," he said. Another billionaire interested in a potential TikTok deal is Frank McCourt, the founder of the internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers. "There's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business," McCourt has told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. "We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it." His group includes "Shark Tank" star Kevin O’Leary, who has told Yahoo Finance that he, McCourt, and a consortium of business professionals are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a "legacy opportunity." The famed investor told Yahoo Finance that the group’s proposal excludes the platform’s algorithm. McCourt told Reuters last week at Davos that he is open to teaming up with other investors. O’Leary is also still interested, he told CNBC, but the law banning TikTok, which went into effect on Jan. 19, makes things more difficult. "I would love to do a deal if the law provided for it, but I don’t have the luxury of breaching the order of Congress," he said to CNBC. One other group of investors has publicly announced its interest in buying TikTok, and it claims to have an internet celebrity in its corner. It includes Jesse Tinsley, founder and CEO of Employer.com. The web celebrity is Jimmy Donaldson, the popular YouTuber better known as "MrBeast." The group submitted an all-cash bid, according to a release from Paul Hastings LLP, which said it is representing the investors. The Paul Hastings team includes Brad Bondi, brother of Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick to be attorney general of the US. Tinsley said on X that "our goal is to ensure TikTok stays accessible, thriving, and aligned with the values that make America great," he wrote. His group, he added, is "ready to structure the deal in whatever way President Trump and our government wish."

Title: Taiwan may offer help for industry over Trump tariff threats

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government will soon look at whether it needs to help its domestic industry over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to put tariffs on semiconductors, Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Wednesday. Home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Trump said on Monday he plans to impose tariffs on imported chips, pharmaceuticals and steel to get the producers to make them in the United States. Responding to a question on Trump's remarks, Cho said the economy ministry and other departments have been paying close attention to the "developments of the past few days". "In a day or two we will urgently look at whether we need to make more cooperative plans and future assistance programmes for the industrial sector," he added. "I would like to reassure our compatriots that Taiwan's position in the world's industrial chain is not to be ignored, and that we will continue to maintain such an advantage." Taiwan has to continue to strive for more cooperation externally and to maintain its leadership in the industrial and technological sectors, Cho added. In 2020, under the first Trump administration, TSMC announced that it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in a win for efforts by the U.S. government to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. It later boosted those plans with the total investment now standing at $65 billion. TSMC has declined to comment on Trump's latest tariff remarks. This month, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he only expected a small impact from any tariffs imposed by Trump on semiconductor exports given their technological superiority. In another potential challenge for Taiwan, Trump last week directed federal agencies to investigate persistent U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States surged 83% last year compared with 2023, with exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

The White House is looking into national security concerns over Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek after its developer prompted a global tech sell-off. The National Security Council is reviewing the AI app’s potential national security implications, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing, according to Axios. Leavitt added that President Donald Trump sees the AI startup’s newly released AI models as a “wake-up call” for AI developers in the U.S., but that “we’ll restore American dominance.” Last week, Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.28%) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. DeepSeek also announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. Leavitt also said the Biden administration “sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,” according to Axios. During his final days in office, the former president introduced additional measures focused on curbing advanced chip exports to China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from certain semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development.

Title: 6 Semiconductor ETFs To Buy For 2025

Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their ... [+] weighting methodologies. Semiconductor stocks outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. The momentum will likely continue as global AI infrastructure spending keeps those chipmakers busy. The recently announced Stargate project funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX is an example. Stargate is slated to pour $500 billion into AI data centers over the next four years. Despite China's recent announcement about its DeepSeek technology, semiconductor stocks still have bright futures. A diversified semiconductor ETF is a smart choice if you are new to this space. Below, you will meet six high-performing semiconductor funds—one of which could fit nicely in your ETF portfolio. The universe of semiconductor ETFs is small. There are about two dozen of them in total. The list shrinks to about 10 when you exclude leveraged and inverse funds. Leverage funds use debt to amplify returns, but this also increases risk. Inverse funds produce the opposite return of an underlying index. So, if a semiconductor index rises 10%, the inverse ETF would lose 10%. Because leveraged and inverse funds are too risky for most investors, they are excluded from this list. The 10 remaining funds were sorted on their one-year total returns. Total return includes appreciation and dividends. None are dividend ETFs per se, but they do pay small yields. The list of 10 was then trimmed to the top six semiconductor ETFs, ordered from highest to lowest return. The table below introduces six semiconductor ETFs with total one-year returns ranging from 11.89% to 39.69%. Read on for an overview of each semiconductor fund. Metrics are current as of January 27 after close of trading. For more investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. SMH tracks the results of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index. The index and the fund include the 25 largest U.S. exchange-traded stocks that generate 50% or more of their revenues from semiconductors. The stocks are market-cap-weighted with a maximum weighting of 20%. VanEck's semiconductor ETF is the only pick on this list tracking the MVIS domestic semiconductor index. It is also the only fund that returned more than 30% to its shareholders over the last year. The secret is the aggressive weighting of Nvidia (NVDA) at 19.19% and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at 12.96%. This one-two punch of semiconductor stocks has delivered huge gains over the past year, but the combination is risky. Nvidia is TSM's second-largest customer, so the companies' futures are linked. This ETF bets heavily that Nvidia and, by association, TSM will continue monetizing the AI buildout. If Nvidia stumbles, you might regret the fund's high concentration of those two stocks. The Columbia ETF is an actively managed fund that invests in semiconductor companies with promising, long-term growth potential. Selection factors include the quality of the management team and intellectual property. Stocks in the portfolio are weighted by conviction—so the highest-potential securities, as determined by fund manager analysis, are held in the largest quantities. The stocks in the SEMI portfolio are picked by humans who continually research and analyze the semiconductor space. Other ETFs on this list use an index to define their holdings. The human component creates the potential to beat index performance. The trade-off is a higher expense ratio since actively managed funds are more expensive to operate. Nvidia and Broadcom are the two largest holdings. Combined, they account for more than 40% of this fund's portfolio. To date, SEMI's returns have been competitive but not segment-leading. Strive's semiconductor ETF tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index. The index and fund include the top 30 semiconductor stocks weighted with a modified market cap formula. The maximum weighting is 22.5% and the cumulative weight of stocks comprising more than 4.5% of the index is capped at 45%. Strive's fund was launched in October 2022, making it the youngest fund on this list. It has the highest average annual return since inception, partially due to good timing. The fund launched just as tech stocks started rebounding from a tough 2022. SHOC has benefited from high concentrations in Nvidia and Broadcom. The fund currently holds these stocks at 20.02% and 17.57%, respectively. ASML Holding NV (ASML) is also a top holding at 8.98%. The remaining positions are weighted at 4.5% or lower. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF tracks an index of semiconductor stocks in the S&P Total Market Index. As of January 2025, there are 41 companies in the index and the fund, and individual weightings are capped at 4.5%. The SPDR semiconductor fund includes large, mid and small cap stocks using a modified equal-weighting system. With a larger portfolio and an exposure limit of 4.5% on any one security, XSD is the most balanced of the funds on this list. Broadcom is the largest holding at 3.93%, while Nvidia is the 12th largest position at 3.01%. This fund is a nice choice for investors who want diversified exposure to smaller semiconductor stocks such as Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) and Ambarella (AMBA). Invesco's original semiconductor ETF, PSI, tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex℠ Index. Intellidex indexes identify companies with high capital gains potential by analyzing price and earnings momentum, quality, management and value. The index and fund use a modified equal-weighting system so individual stock exposures have a limited range of 1.74% to 6.47%. PSI's modified equal-weighting system reduces over-concentration risk in mega-tech stocks Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom is the fund's top holding, weighted at 6.73%, and Nvidia is number five, weighted at 4.76%. This weighting system removes Nvidia's dominance and allows smaller companies more influence over the group's performance. PSI has delivered solid growth in the past year, without relying on one or two tickers. This fund is a good choice for investors wanting more balanced exposure to the semiconductor space. PHLX is Invesco's newer semiconductor ETF, launched in 2021. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which includes the largest, U.S.-listed 30 semiconductor stocks. The stocks are weighted by market capitalization with some limitations. For example, the top three positions cannot exceed 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. SOXQ has the lowest expense ratio and the second-highest dividend yield among the ETFs here. The fund's weighting system moderates over-concentration risk while allowing the big players some room to carry the portfolio's performance. SOXQ also includes 4.45% exposure to Taiwan Semiconductor, which is left out of several other funds. Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their weighting methodologies. Market-weighted funds depend on the biggest companies, while equal-weighted funds capture more growth from smaller companies. Your risk tolerance and investing philosophy can reveal which strategy suits you best. Do you believe in letting growth stocks run? If yes, then choose a market-weighted fund. If you worry that ever-rising stock prices may ultimately retreat, opt for equal weighting.

Title: DeepSeek Is Causing Stock Market Panic. Here's Why It Matters.

Senior Reporter, Work/Life If you follow the stock market, then you know all about the bogeyman scaring Wall Street right now: DeepSeek. The Chinese ChatGPT competitor is currently the top-downloaded productivity app in the U.S. Apple app store. DeepSeek’s newest open-source model, R1, was released last week, and it is wowing the AI industry because it reportedly has advanced capabilities for a fraction of the price ― and without needing the same energy ― as U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. On Monday, Nvidia ― which largely makes the highly specialized, expensive chips that are powering the U.S. AI boom ― saw its shares plunge 17% in response to the news about DeepSeek’s AI model, causing the company to lose almost $600 billion in market value. It was the biggest one-day loss ever for a public company. Other AI-related stocks, including Broadcom, also saw their stocks slump by over 10% yesterday. In other words, a huge sell-off of stock just happened. This drop reflects “a sharp pullback in price because of an abundance of sellers,” explained Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “Stock prices are a reflection of future corporate earnings expectations. Anything that changes the assumptions in those earnings expectations can lead to a sharp correction in price,” he said. “In technology, the ever-present risk is that a competitor will come along with a better, cheaper or more efficient mousetrap and pose a threat to future earnings. When this happens, investors tend to sell first and ask questions later.” Many investors are clearly panicking and making bets on the future of AI, but should you? HuffPost asked financial experts about what, if anything, you should be doing with your money ― regardless of what you have invested. Some people are wondering if the sell-off of Nvidia (NVDA) stock makes it actually a good time to buy Nvidia stock, but financial experts advise against making any sudden changes. “You should never respond to one-off changes in the stock market, and you should not be investing in individual stocks or worried about the changes in individual stocks,” warned University of Houston economist Dietrich Vollrath. “You should, as always, be invested in broad index funds with the lowest possible expense ratios.“ It’s easy to get swept up in the success stories of individual stocks paying off loans or houses, but here are some sobering facts: Only about 1% of investors are successful at timing the stock market. Remember GameStop’s quick rise and fall? YouTuber David Dobrik said he lost $85,000 investing in GameStop during its short-lived hype. Ideally, you should diversify your investments so one stock’s financial losses do not crater or compound your own. “Investors should aim at having a diversified portfolio and are usually better off not trying to time the market,” Gil Luria, head of technology research for financial services firm D.A. Davidson, said Tuesday. “NVDA shares declined yesterday because there are new concerns regarding their ability to continue to grow at the same rate as the last couple of years.” And if you did invest solely in AI chip makers, use this stinging loss as your sign to spread your money around. “Yesterday’s market moves also underscore the risks of being too heavily concentrated in a narrow sector of the market,” McBride said. “If you have too much of your wealth tied up in a handful of closely related stocks, it serves as a wake-up call to spread the money out and cushion against a sudden downdraft.” Before you invest your housing payment in risky stocks, follow this basic financial advice: Make sure you have money set aside in your emergency savings, which ideally is three to six months of after-tax living expenses, so you always have money to fall back on. And do make clear financial goals, such as saving for retirement, so that your investment decisions are aligned with your risk appetite. Although AI chip makers had a bad day Monday on Wall Street, they are already beginning to bounce back a day later. Instead of being reactive to the stock market going up or down a lot in one day, look at the big picture. “Looking at trends over several years provides a more accurate picture, as markets can experience significant volatility within a single year. Over time, markets have a way of balancing out,” said Ramona Ortega, CEO and founder of WealthBuild, an AI-powered financial assistant. “There’s no exact timeline for when corrections will occur, but history shows they always do.” Vollrath said what happened to Nvidia is a “reminder that the economy is not the stock market. This means essentially nothing for the economy, in terms of economic growth, interest rates or employment.“ Is Monday’s chip-maker sell-off an overreaction, or is DeepSeek’s low-cost breakthrough a fundamental shift to where the AI market is heading? It’s too soon to tell whether this will have larger repercussions for AI jobs and consumer spending, experts say. The next four years will change America forever.

You and I will forget about this in a week.”

Title: Why DeepSeek’s cost-efficient R1 spooked Nvidia investors, according to a strategist

Time Published: 2025-01-28T21:25:00Z

Viraj “Raj” Patel, Head of Asset Allocation at Fiduciary Trust International, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Could DeepSeek’s rise signal increased global competition for Nvidia? And how should investors react? VP: We think that the announcement at DeepSeek over the weekend was certainly a wake up or an aha moment for AI. I think for a while a lot of investors were thinking that the US is the only game for AI. And this was obviously not just a breakthrough, but I think DeepSeek also told us that they can build AI models that could compete with the US at a much lower cost. So I think what spooked markets yesterday was not necessarily the development of an AI model by DeepSeek. I think the idea was always that while the U.S. had a lead, it was foolish to think that they would be the only game in town. I think the massive step function down in cost so soon spooked AI investors versus what you would expect on a technology to have more of a smoother glide path at early stages of implementation. So I think for the hyperscalers and AI companies that are spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I think this is maybe a little bit of a wake up call in terms of this is productive capital and productive investment behind a technology that is largely going to be transformative. But the new question in markets after DeepSeek’s announcement on what they’ve been able to accomplish at the cost they’ve been able to do that is is the return on investment that a lot of these Mag 7 hyperscalers and AI companies are throwing behind in CapEx and investment going to yield a sufficient return on investment? Our answer is yes. We wouldn’t extrapolate one day of market activity into a long-term thesis or just one announcement over the weekend on an AI competitor, but we think that this is a real technology that should have productive benefits to society in the intermediate to long term. But in the short-term here, lots to unpack in terms of investment, what the existing assumptions were regarding what it takes to build and train AI models may have been upended a little bit, but again, we are acutely focused on earnings this week where a lot of AI or hyperscalers are reporting earnings in the technology and Mag 7 space and it’ll be interesting to see what they have to say. AM: And Nvidia (NVDA) has said that DeepSeek-R1 actually is good, that it will mean that eventually they’ll have to buy more Nvidia chips. And the assumption is that Nvidia chips maybe are even being used secretly in this R1. Do you believe Nvidia when they say that? VP: Lots to unpack. As I said, I think early indications from AI experts are questioning whether the technology they have built at the cost they built it at could be built with Nvidia’s newest hardware, which is leading others to believe that okay, they might have built this technology or this AI model with older Nvidia chips, which you can use then to circumvent some of the export controls on chips that the US has in place. But again, I think a lot more is to be learned in the coming days and weeks in terms of just how they built this on the timescale they have, the cost they have and on the hardware they have. So if they build something circumventing some of the export controls on chips, they’re probably not likely to be transparent about it. But as more details come out and just how efficient and comparable these AI models are, or language learning models to some of the US counterparts which are using best-in-class chips and hardware will come to light over the coming days and weeks and see if they can really kind of compete on an apples to apples basis. AM: The DeepSeek news was a shock to investors. Are there sectors or opportunities you see elsewhere in the market where they should consider investing? VP: Yeah, we think if you think about the Mag 7 AI or technology trade, which has done really well and as you mentioned earlier, looking for places to rotate in the markets, i.e. areas that have done really well, Mag 7 and technology, and now we are facing four years of a new administration under President Trump. They are natural beneficiaries in other sectors like financials for example. We have a regime in place that is pro-business, pro-markets, wants decreased regulations. We should see increased activity in capital markets, increased activity by the investment banks, likely more IPO activity. These are natural secular tailwinds for financials. We think given the deregulation mantra that President Trump and his administration is talking about, we think there’s opportunities in cyclical areas like energy materials, industrials, especially if he’s thinking seriously about implementing some of his protectionist policies about making more at home, manufacturing at home and really boosting manufacturing inside of the us. Those areas should be natural beneficiaries as well. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq jumps to chip away at DeepSeek-fueled rout as Nvidia surges nearly 9%

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded on Tuesday, following a steep stock sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and the ripple effect its potentially cheaper AI model could have on Big Tech. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) was the standout of the trading day, with shares finishing the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap in the previous session. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. Notably, the tech sector notched its biggest two-day reversal in over two years after it notched its worst day since March 2020 on Monday. Stocks began to chip away at losses booked in Monday's tech-led rout, which came as buzz built for DeepSeek's potentially cheaper AI model. That risk to US leadership in AI raised questions about whether chipmakers and other tech names can follow through on high earnings expectations. With the DeepSeek risk in mind, focus is tighter on Big Tech earnings coming this week, with results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) on the docket. Investors also assessed a tougher tone on tariffs from President Donald Trump as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday where the impact of his policies will likely be discussed. The central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, given recent solid economic readings. The dollar (DX=F) strengthened after renewed tariff threats from Trump that revived worries about a trade war, already in focus after a brief standoff with Colombia. Trump said he wants universal tariffs "much bigger" than the 2.5% his incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, reportedly plans to introduce gradually. Starbucks (SBUX) stock rose over 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Same-store sales declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as the company looks to continue its recent turnaround plan. “While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released Tuesday afternoon. The company’s same-store sales, a key metric for restaurant chains, fell 4% year over year in the reported quarter, with traffic to its stores declining by 6%. Wall Street had expected same-store sales and foot traffic to decline by 5.30% and 7.28%, respectively, year over year. Outside of domestic markets, same-store sales also declined 4%, while sales in China — the company's second-largest market — fell by 6%. Stocks closed in the green on Tuesday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded from Monday's steep sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and its potentially cheaper AI model. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) finished the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap on Monday. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. The fourth volume of Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, released on Tuesday, tells the story of markets and economy through 44 charts. And given that we ask a broad question about what the most important chart is for investors right now, there's sometimes a takeaway in what respondents don't send. After the past several versions of this book included many charts making the case for interest rate cuts, there was little discussion of further easing from the Federal Reserve throughout our latest collection of charts. Dynamic Economic Strategy CEO John Silvia's submission helps explain why. Silvia pointed out that at 4.1%, the unemployment rate is hovering near where the Fed expects it to end this year, while private payroll growth has come off the boil. To Silvia, this shows a labor market that may be normalizing right in the area the Fed would like it to stay. This, Silvia said, provides "less room for the Fed to ease as job/economic growth continues to move ahead and long-run full employment is on the horizon." With inflation relatively sticky and the labor market holding up OK, many economists right now seem more interested in Trump's policies. Specifically the focus centers around how tariffs could impact inflation, and therefore Fed policy, before making further conclusions on the path forward for interest rates. Check out the full Yahoo Finance Chartbook here. Some breaking news that's not related to DeepSeek or Wall Street's AI trades: The Container Store has emerged from bankruptcy. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the latest: The struggling home goods store emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, Yahoo Finance learned exclusively. In a release, the company said it "achieved the objectives it set for this process" in late December. That includes refinancing its short-term debt, reducing "previous long-term debt obligations," gaining access to $40 million in new money financing, and "modifying its asset-backed lending facility to add $40 million in upsized capacity." Throughout the process, the business operated as usual across stores, online, and in-home services. It was also able to "[meet] its obligations to vendors, employees and customers." No employees were let go, but the company did close down two stores since the bankruptcy filing. The closings were separate from the bankruptcy process. Formerly under the ticker TCSG, the company is now private after the restructuring process. For the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2024, the Container Store listed total liabilities of $836.4 million against $969 million in total assets. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 7% Tuesday afternoon as tech stocks rebounded from a sharp sell-off. The AI chip giant bounced back from its 17% drop on Monday sparked by investor anxiety related to a new AI model recently launched by Chinese startup DeepSeek. The artificial intelligence assistant, seen as more efficient and less expensive than its American-made rivals, spooked investor sentiment over AI dominance in the US and raised questions about valuations and spending. AI-exposed power stocks attempted a rebound on Tuesday after getting crushed in the tech rout prompted by fears that energy demand for the artificial intelligence boom may be ahead of its skies. Constellation Energy (CEG), the largest nuclear plant operator in the US was relatively flat after tumbling 21% during the prior session. Electricity generator Vistra Corp (VST) rose more than 4% after sinking by a record 28%. Power equipment maker and servicer GE Vernova (GEV) also gained 2%, retracing a fraction of its one-day 21% drop. AI-exposed energy stocks were recovering from a beating on Monday after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model viewed as more competitive and energy-efficient compared to its US rivals. The sell-off rattled investors given the optimism over electricity needs to power the booming AI data center industry. Power stocks are coming off a ripping rally in 2024 and start of the year. Paul Zimbardo, managing director for US power utilities & clean energy research at Jeffrries, said data center deployment is "very likely intact" in the medium term as the race remains "on." The question going forward is what happens in the later part of the decade and 2030s. "Does that trend accelerate in the future? Does it kind of stabilize and even see some moderation of demand growth out later in the decade?" asked the analyst. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: New mixed messages this week about President Donald Trump's implementation of tariffs are flummoxing markets and businesses hoping for quick clarity on the 2.0 version of Trump's trade policy. The main point of confusion is that public signals from Trump’s orbit often appear at odds with Trump himself. The sometimes contradictory back and forth — a feature of the debate around tariffs since Trump's win — is taking on an outsized importance with the approach of Trump’s self-imposed Feb. 1 deadline, whe he has promised to install 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% duties on China. Read more here. OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models and it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data. "By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people," the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool. Read more about ChatGPT Gov's product launch here. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining more than 1% on Tuesday. Apple (AAPL), an outlier during Monday's tech rout, extended gains to rise more than 3%. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% in early trading, retracing a fraction of its 17% plunge from the prior session. JetBlue (JBLU) shares fell as much as 22% on Tuesday, their biggest drop since 2020 after the air carrier posted disappointing first quarter outlook for revenue per available seat mile (RASM). For the current three month period, JetBlue forecasts revenue per available seat mile between a decline of 0.5% and an increase of 3.5%, versus estimates for growth above 4%. JetBlue's fourth quarter loss came in narrower than expected, at an adjusted loss per share of $0.21, versus estimates for - $0.31. The domestic low-cost carrier also faces higher costs. JetBlue has faced a number of challenges over the past year, including a blocked merger with peer Spirit in 2024. US home prices hit a record high in November as the pace of price increases picked up. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3.8% from a year earlier in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, higher than the 3.6% annual increase in October. The data captures a three-month period through November when mortgage rates were climbing toward 7%, providing little relief for would-be buyers in a seasonally slower selling season. Despite the rise in borrowing costs, the national index hit a record high for the 18th consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Still, on a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.4% over the prior month in November, up from October's 0.3% monthly increase. Brian D. Luke, head of commodities at S&P CoreLogic, said in a statement, “With the exception of pockets of above-trend performance, national home prices are trending below historical averages.” The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 4.3% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 4.2% increase in the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data. New York remained the top state for annual gains, with a 7.3% increase. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 attempted to recover on Tuesday from a sharp tech-led rout prompted by AI worries. The Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting which started earlier in the morning was also in focus for investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4% after sliding 3% in the prior session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, attempting to recover from a 17% plunge in the prior session as the buzz around Chinese startup DeepSeek raised questions of overvaluation and spending in much of the US artificial intelligence space. Investors are keeping a close eye on any additional tariff talk from President Trump and how that may impact economic growth. The market now awaits the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected on Wednesday afternoon following their two-day meeting. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% pre-market Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% free-fall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday but began to recover Tuesday morning. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: General Motors (GM) chair and CEO Mary Barra has made her case on tariffs to President Trump. "We've done a lot of scenario planning and we know the levers that we can pull to minimize any impact. But, having the opportunity to talk to the president, I really believe he wants a strong manufacturing sector because it's good for the economy," Barra told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. GM on its earnings release today said it assumes a "stable" policy environment. Its full-year 2025 EPS guidance of $11 to $12 was ahead of consensus forecasts for $10.75 and doesn't assume any impact of additional tariffs. Read more here.

The Nasdaq and other major indexes rebounded on Tuesday, recovering from the sharp sell-off triggered by DeepSeek’s crash, which had sent AI stocks tumbling. Nvidia, which plunged over 16% on Monday, regained more than 7% in the rebound. By the late afternoon, the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 408 points, or 2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, due on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Other major chip stocks also recovered a bit on Tuesday, including Broadcom (AVGO+6.63%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.93%). This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL-0.28%), Tesla (TSLA+2.26%), Meta (META+2.33%), and Microsoft (MSFT-5.86%). Other than tech giants, Visa (V+2.18%), Mastercard (MA+4.56%), Novartis (NVS+0.26%), and others will also share their financial report cards. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: “DEEP-CRASH!”
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/deep-crash/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:05:49Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted January 28, 2025 The opening salvo of a hot artificial intelligence battle just dumped a bucket of cold water on the stock market. Big Tech spiraled lower to kick off the trading week after a Chinese AI firm called DeepSeek made huge waves in the industry. The ten-second version of this story is DeepSeek can do everything the other major AI firms can do, and more — all for a fraction of the cost, time, and equipment. As far as I can tell, there’s still plenty of arguing about the details of just how powerful this thing is by folks a lot smarter and more tech-savvy than me. The first rumblings of DeepSeek’s amazing achievements hit the market Friday, causing scattered selling in chip king Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). Shares ended the day down more than 3%. Not a great day — but also not the end of the world, as NVDA was able to post its second straight week of gains. But tech investors became noticeably nervous Sunday evening. By Monday morning, the DeepDeek fiasco sparked a mini-panic that ripped through the semiconductors and tech at large. The Nasdaq Composite gapped down nearly 3.5% to kick off the new trading week, while NVDA steadily dropped all morning, losing 17% by the closing bell. NVDA isn’t the only casualty of the DeepSeek crash. Speculators dumped their Big Tech shares, Bitcoin, and anything even remotely associated with the AI boom. The financial media wasted no time playing up the ugly numbers. Bloomberg was one of the first to note that the NVDA rout was the biggest in market history. “Nvidia shares tumbled as much as 18% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020,” Bloomberg reports. “In early afternoon trading in New York, the decline erased $560 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history.” What Bloomberg failed to note in its headline (and what is obvious from the above graph) is that due to its sheer size, NVDA’s notable drops during its incredible two-year rally make up 80% of the biggest single-day market-cap losses in history. The lesson: big numbers are big! Plus, these huge drops didn’t stop the stock from rallying more than 1,200% off its 2022 bear market lows. In case those gains fail to impress you, please note that yesterday’s drop shoved NVDA below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. I know it’s all too easy to get sucked into the bearish narrative after watching yesterday’s action unfold. But instead of focusing on the hundreds of billions in market cap that disappeared, I’m far more interested in what the rest of the market has to say in reaction to the NVDA situation. We’ve already witnessed the premarket panic, NVDA dropping double-digits, and other big tech names falling in sympathy. And while most market-watchers are hung up on hoping and praying NVDA catches a bid off these panic lows, we can use the confusion to our advantage. For starters, I’m keeping an eye on tech names that have little involvement in the AI ecosystem. While the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by more than 3% on Monday, more than 1,600 components finished the day in positive territory. Of these stocks, 150 gained more than 5%. Sharp declines in NVDA, ORCL, AVGO, MSFT, GOOG, and TSLA masked many of the positives happening under the surface. Then there are stocks outside of the tech sphere (Yes, they exist!)… Perhaps you’ve heard of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Big Board had a big day Monday. While everyone was sweating NVDA, the Dow posted a modest gain of 0.65%. But here’s the kicker: Every single stock in the Dow finished the day in the green. This looks more like a rotation than a selloff. While investors are ditching NVDA, they’re clearly putting money work elsewhere. Consumer staples, discretionary, and financials all managed to post gains yesterday. Finally, is the DeepSeek revelation a catalyst for a major trend reversal in China? The iShares China Large-cap ETF (FXI) posted a gain of almost 1% on Monday while the American tech sector faltered. At this point, we don’t know how much of the DeepSeek news is hype, panic, or somewhere in between. But investors are reacting favorably to Chinese names. Remember, these stocks have been a sloppy mess for years. They stopped going down as of early last year and have been trying to produce a steady uptrend ever since. We’ll see if this news is a game changer and leads to a bigger move higher in FXI. NVDA is not the stock market – no matter how much the financial media insists otherwise. Judging by Monday’s action, we’ll have little trouble finding viable trade ideas outside of the AI trainwreck. We might even get a reprieve from AI insanity thanks to a slew of tech earnings hitting later this week. TSLA, META, MSFT, IBM, and NOW report on Wednesday afternoon. AAPL and INTC follow on Thursday afternoon. If these aren’t enough distractions for you, we also have a Fed meeting and rate decision on Wednesday, GDP Thursday, and this morning’s durable orders to dissect. The market tends to have a short memory during busy trading periods. With a full slate scheduled this week, the NVDA strife could fall off the front page faster than you could imagine…

Title: Why Dell Technologies Stock Is Down 9% In A Day?

POLAND - 2025/01/11: In this photo illustration, a Dell logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) suffered a 9% stock drop on Monday, January 27, amid concerns sparked by DeepSeek’s affordable AI chatbot. This emerging technology has disrupted the industry, posing a significant threat to U.S. tech leaders and raising questions about the long-term viability of AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia’s stock(NASDAQ: NVDA) also felt the ripple effect, and plummeted 17% on the same day. See Why Is DeepSeek Sinking Nvidia Stock? Chinese AI DeepSeek has open-sourced its R1 model, which has been shown to outperform leading models from OpenAI and Meta in various benchmarks. What’s more, this breakthrough technology is not only freely available but also offers a cost-efficient solution that requires fewer computing resources, making it an attractive proposition for the industry. The situation could have particular significance for Dell’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI servers. Dell’s revenue streams are diversified, with roughly half derived from personal computers (PCs) sales and related products, while the remaining half comes from its robust infrastructure business, including servers, where the company holds a dominant market position. While Dell’s Q3 sales grew 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $24.4 billion, the company’s client solutions group experienced a 1% y-o-y decline in revenue to $12.1 billion. Consumer sales within this segment plummeted 18% y-o-y. However, Dell’s infrastructure business emerged as a bright spot, growing 34% y-o-y to $11.4 billion - with server and networking revenue surging 58% y-o-y to $7.4 billion. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Dell’s investment in AI servers is poised to drive substantial growth in its infrastructure business, as the AI server market is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2029. While AI-powered servers are typically low-margin, the sheer scale of the market presents a compelling growth opportunity. This growth will likely be complemented by increasing revenue from AI-optimized PC sales on the consumer side. While Dell’s revenues may be held back somewhat by the struggling PC segment, a substantial PC upgrade cycle is anticipated in 2025. The current economic climate and rising inflation have led to delayed tech upgrades. However, the availability of AI-enabled PCs, combined with the impending end of Windows 10 support in October 2025, may prompt consumers to upgrade their machines to leverage next-generation technologies and ensure ongoing security updates. With AI empowering both legitimate users and hackers, the need for enhanced protection may further incentivize upgrades. Dell’s stock valuation remains relatively modest, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, suggesting that the shares may still be undervalued. However, with the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned that the sales growth may be slower than anticipated. DELL stock has seen a 38% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -27% in 2022, 96% in 2023, and 53% in 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In conclusion, Dell’s attractive valuation, robust server and networking sales, and the impending PC refresh cycle position the company for potential outperformance, making it a compelling AI stock pick for 2025 and beyond. However, investors should exercise caution, as Dell’s business remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting industry trends.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

January 28, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz At the risk of repeating myself ad nauseam, this is as good a time as any to remind ourselves how little we know about the present and how completely unexpected events can be in the future. Our story so far: The technology sector has been booming for well over a decade. Software, mobile, e-tail, big data, LLM, and now AI have all been in growth mode. Expectations have been that this is the story of the next generation. Powerful semiconductors and sophisticated software will drive the demand for freestanding, energy-hungry data centers. That was upended by a scrappy China-based hedge fund that created an innovation to perform the functions of ChatGPT but with much less semiconductor horsepower needed. Free and Open Source, it created an order-of-magnitude decrease in costs. At one point yesterday markets were off 3-4%, NVIDIA was down almost 20%, and nearly a trillion dollars in market cap disappeared. As a short reminder, almost nobody had in their forecasts: 2020: Global pandemic that shut the world’s economy 2021: Inflation spikes, heads toward 9% 2022: Russia Invades Ukraine (February 24) 2023: Hamas surprise terror attack on Israel begins Gaza war (October 7) 2024: DeepSeek roils markets, challenges US advantages in AI If these surprises or random events were rarities, then perhaps we could dismiss them. Was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 a one-off? Pearl Harbor? JFK assassination? 9/11? The reality is that events that are wholly unexpected and feel random occur with shocking regularity. The years that DON’T have a big surprise are the outliers, not the shock years. I sure as hell did not see DeepSeek coming. Very few others did, either. But we should never expect any company to own their sector forever. In “How Not to Invest,” I wrote, “It may be hard to imagine today, but your great-grandkids would probably laugh at the reverence once shown for Starbucks, Facebook, Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and even Apple.” I was referring to Aswath Damodaran’s latest work, “The Corporate Life Cycle: Business, Investment, and Management Implications.,” where he compares all companies to people. They are born, go through growth spurts, mature, and eventually die. Even once-dominant firms like Intel, GE, or Cisco – all eventually lose a step and fade. As the chart above shows, NVDA goes through regular drawdowns — 66% in 2022-23. My colleague Callie Cox discussed this a week ago — only she was referring to Apple, not Nvidia. We were less than 4 weeks into the new year when a random event that no one had on their bingo card upended everybody’s market forecasts and sector picks.

Title: Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia’s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn’t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 "an excellent AI advancement" in a statement Monday. Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek’s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called “distillation” — in other words, it relied on Meta’s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model — the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” Sur wrote. Danley added: “Given Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.” Even so, DeepSeek “clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Title: DeepSeek is the 'Temu of AI,' analysts say

After traders sold off global technology stocks en masse Monday on news of a Chinese artificial intelligence competitor, some aren’t too concerned with DeepSeek’s seemingly meteoric rise. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a note Tuesday that they “view the DeepSeek fear across the tech world as in essence a ‘tech AI head fake’ that will be short lived as more details and analysis comes out about DeepSeek’s model and China resources.” The sell-off led to a $1 trillion loss in market capitalization, with much of that driven by heavy bleeding in the tech sector. Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) alone, which closed down 17% on Monday, shed $600 billion in market value — the largest single-day loss of any company in U.S. history. It ended the day with a share price of $118.68, bringing its market cap to $2.9 trillion. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading. Contracts for major U.S. indices were relatively flat early Tuesday. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.33%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.28%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. It also said it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. But Wedbush said it’s not worried about DeepSeek disrupting the planned $2 trillion in capital expenditures expected on AI in the coming years. “DeepSeek created an awesome LLM model (and credit to its software developers) however this Chinese AI small lab/LLM model is not bringing down the entire US tech ecosystem with it,” the analysts wrote. “Just like Temu was the ‘Amazon (AMZN-0.92%) model destroyer’ a few years ago... Amazon’s team adjusted and now look,” they said, referring it to the Chinese-origin e-commerce company that was feared to pose a major threat to competitors with its rock-bottom prices.

Title: Trump says DeepSeek's AI bombshell should be a 'wake-up call' for Big Tech

The release of DeepSeek-R1, a new open-source reasoning model from a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, should be a “wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry, President Donald Trump said. While speaking at a gathering of House Republican lawmakers on Monday night in Miami, Trump called for American tech companies to be “laser-focused” on competing with rivals like DeepSeek. “When you hear a DeepSeek, when you hear somebody — somebody come up with something, we always have the ideas. We’re always first,” Trump said at the event. “So, I would say that’s a positive... instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.” DeepSeek in December released a model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia. The release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks on Monday. DeepSeek also published a new set of AI models that the company said can outperform OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion Xl. DeepSeek’s Janus-Pro model family is published under a license that allows it to be used commercially without restrictions. Last week, Trump invited executives at OpenAI, Japanese investment bank SoftBank (SFTBY+3.82%), and software company Oracle (ORCL+5.17%) to the White House to announce Stargate, a joint venture that plans to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years. The project is planned to exclusively serve OpenAI, The Financial Times reported. Through a sweeping executive order, Trump has also revoked his predecessor’s 2023 executive order on AI safety and security, which was praised by a trade group representing U.S. tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN-0.92%) and Google (GOOGL+2.40%). He also signed a new order directing a group of White House tech and science officials to develop a new AI action plan within 180 days. “DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and top Trump advisor on cryptocurrency and AI, wrote on X. “I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” he added. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+3.82%), Broadcom (AVGO+6.63%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.91%), Micron (MU+3.97%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.93%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.33%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.28%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS+1.60%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT-5.86%), Amazon (AMZN-0.92%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL+2.40%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. DeepSeek's R1 AI model seems to have undermined the prevailing narrative around hyperscalers, wounding NVIDIA in the process. Even so, NVIDIA remains the strongest horse in the proverbial stable. As evidence, look no further than AMD, which has just received another downgrade, and that too on a vector wholly unrelated to the ongoing DeepSeek-related saga. Melius Downgrades $AMD to Hold from Buy, Cuts PT to $129 from $160, Cites Increased Pressure on Profit Pools Analyst comments: "We should have done this 10 months ago after an epic run for AMD (up over 40% at one point in 1Q24) - so we better have a reason. Believe it or not,… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 28, 2025 To wit, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes has now downgraded AMD to a 'Hold' rating, while conceding that he should have done so "10 months ago." Reitzes then points out that his AMD downgrade is wholly unrelated to the DeepSeek saga or the likely disappointing 2025 sales numbers for the MI300 GPU: "Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek. We cut numbers already on January 6th on GPUs, and the stock actually went up 3%, so a guide down on disappointing MI300 sales for 2025 is already expected." Instead, Reitzes asserts that Melius is now "more cautious on x86 server and PC over the long term for AMD," based on the conviction that "NVIDIA is going to increasingly 'come for them' in both markets [CPU and GPU] with their Arm-based CPUs that are optimized for accelerated PCs." The analyst goes on to note: "We are increasingly concerned that custom CPUs and Nvidia CPUs will cannibalize even more of the x86 server market long-term, even though AMD's current chip, Turin, is doing well." Accordingly, Melius Research has reduced its target for AMD shares from $160 to $129, implying an upside potential of ~12 percent relative to the stock's current pre-market price of $115.25. Bear in mind that HSBC recently noted that "AMD's AI GPU roadmap is less competitive than previously anticipated, limiting its penetration into the AI GPU market." Also, Wolfe Research noted in December 2024 that "AMD won’t be in a position to guide AI for CY25 – which will in itself drive concerns."

Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat Research, discussed Monday's market sell-off as an "overreaction". On CNBC, Lee said that the double-digit drawdown in NVIDIA (NVDA) is the biggest opportunity since the covid outbreak and will prove to be a great buying moment. "Markets don't like uncertainty, to me, it's an overreaction, and this overreaction will be a great opportunity for investors," Lee said. Lee's call seems good so far. After Nasdaq sold off 3% and NVIDIA dropped 17%, ,Nasdaq futures are up 1% while NVDA is 5% higher in pre-market trading. Monday's sell-off in NVDA was the biggest single-day market cap loss in history, with NVIDIA losing $465 billion in market cap, according to Bloomberg Data. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $97,500 on Monday and is already back above $103,000; but was as high as $105,000 before the news came out on the AI China's DeepSeek; this will be a level bulls will look to reclaim in the short-term. AI bitcoin miners also saw massive drawdowns, as much as 30%, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which is now slightly higher in pre-market. Lee also alludes to a healthy market structure in U.S. equities and notes that bitcoin has outperformed small caps and financials year to date. Wednesday turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting which is largely expected for the federal funds rate to be paused at the 4:25-4:50 rate. Lee says there is some uncertainty going into the meeting as markets are currently too hawkish and believe the market is putting too much emphasis on a potential rate hike in 2025.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The market reacted negatively to DeepSeek's open-source AI release through shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and U.S. tech stocks, but Wedbush analysts urge investors to see the dip as a chance to buy. DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, announced its R1 AI model development took two months to complete while spending less than $6 million. The model achieved explosive popularity and ascended to become Apple's App Store's number one position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. DeepSeek's R1 model threatens American giants OpenAI and Meta (META, Financial), yet Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismisses its impact on Nvidia and competitor performance. DeepSeek's remarkable achievements face multiple hurdles because of strict U.S. chip export regulations, according to Ives' assessment. DeepSeek's ability to contend against established U.S. tech infrastructure is in serious doubt, according to his analysis. Ives interprets the current decline in United States tech shares because he notices frequent market patterns that make these price levels attractive to investors. The extensive corporate investment by U.S. firms in AI across numerous applications, including robotics and autonomous mobility, makes it difficult for DeepSeek to create meaningful competition. The analyst confirmed Nvidia continues to reign as the dominant AI hardware market leader. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Short-Term BTC Holders Quit, CME Open Interest Slid by Record During Monday's Price Drop

Short-term bitcoin (BTC) holders exited the market at a loss Monday as tumbling prices also saw derivative traders throw in the towel, leading to a significant decline in open futures bets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as addresses with a history of holding coins for less than 155 days, sent over 21,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to exchanges at a loss as the largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 4.7%, the most in two weeks, according to CoinDesk Indexes pricing. The transfer to exchanges, often a precursor to sales, was the second-biggest this month and may reflect that purchasers who'd bought when the price was near record highs around $108,000 toward the start of the year were spooked by the sudden slide back into the five digits. These addresses, owned by active traders, new entrants and weak hands, tend to be sensitive to price gyrations and often succumb when prices slide. BTC fell to under $98,000 as the weekend release of the Chinese startup DeepSeek challenged U.S. leadership in AI and technology. Other corners of the market also hinted at capitulation, often observed at local price bottoms. For instance, the perpetual funding rates for BTC flipped negative, a sign of stronger demand for bearish bets. That’s usually when bitcoin reaches a low such as on Jan. 13, when bitcoin dipped below $90,000 and Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind. The de-risking also happened on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, which saw the biggest notional drop in open interest (OI) alongside a double-digit slide in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Notional bitcoin OI fell a record $2.4 billion (17,000 in BTC terms), driving the basis lower, according to Glassnode data. U.S. listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a massive outflow of $457.6 million. A similar outflow occurred Jan. 13, according to Farside data.

Title: Big Retail is bringing out Big AI. Consumers might not even notice
URL: https://qz.com/nrf-2025-retail-big-show-ai-nvidia-amazon-google-1851740452
Time Published: 2025-01-28T10:00:00Z

AI is no longer just a buzzword in retail. It’s a tool retailers are increasingly deploying to transform their business operations. Major retailers are partnering with tech giants such as Google, Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia as they explore AI’s potential. At least at the moment, the technology’s biggest impact is being felt on the supply side, not the point-of-sale. Carrie Tharp, Google Cloud’s vice president of global solutions and industries, said this month that AI’s evolution, particularly its shift from text-based applications to multi-modal tools that process images and videos, can increasingly boost retailers’ bottom lines. “What this looks like for businesses is brand new experiences,” she said at the National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail’s Big Show in New York. AI-driven marketing will gather deeper insights into consumer behavior to enhance personalization, Tharp said. But the real value, she said, is in improving internal processes. Take Home Depot (HD). The home improvement giant has tested pilot projects to create hyper-personalized experiences for customers. While there are customer-facing benefits, the focus remains largely operational. AI is streamlining operations and optimizing Home Depot’s supply chain — which ultimately leads to better experiences for customers, whether or not they see it. Tharp emphasized the importance of equipping store associates and corporate teams with AI tools to drive efficiency. AI is enhancing speed and reducing human error by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more critical decisions. AI’s growing value to retailers was evident during discussions at this month’s NRF Big Show. Companies are eager to optimize their core operations — meaning that’s where they’re most willing to spend money on AI. Tharp highlighted how Google’s (GOOGL) AI products are being integrated into the retail journey behind-the-scenes. Google’s advancements in search and consumer metrics allow retailers to track up to 10 touch points, or the interactions a customer makes with an item or product before they make a purchase decision. With AI-powered systems, retailers can predict what products will be in demand before they go out of stock “This has important implications for supply chain optimization and demand forecasting, two areas where AI capabilities can be especially useful,” Tharp said. Quantum AI is expected to take retail to even greater heights — although Tharp stressed the importance of mastering basic AI use cases first. “The priority is not only to enhance customer experiences,” she said, “but also make back-end operations more nimble and responsive to changing market conditions.” Fast food chains and discount retailers are also catching on. Greg Fiddes, Google’s director of Chrome enterprise software partnerships, shared at NRF’s Big Show how Chrome OS, a cloud-based operating system, is being used to streamline in-store operations at pizza giant Domino’s — a chain that touted using AI to make pizzas “before people ordered them” last year. Chrome OS now essentially runs interactive kiosks and digital signage across Domino’s more than 6,700 U.S. locations. Fiddes also noted the security AI provides. The software has never experienced a ransomware attack such as the one seen by CrowdStrike last year. This is crucial during peak times such as Super Bowl Sunday , when Domino’s delivers up to two million pizzas. “If you don’t make, take or bake the pizzas, you support those who do,” Michael Crumley, Domino’s manager of store technology, said of TK. “The ability to remotely manage and support devices is a major benefit, especially for a large retail chain with multiple locations.” Other big food chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s are using some form of AI, all with the goal of feeding customers faster. Retail giant Costco also relies on Chrome OS to manage operations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) is using AI and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to streamline operations. This is especially helpful in rural areas where connectivity can be challenging. The move could help Dollar Tree better handle operations as it considers a sale of its Family Dollar brand. Retailers are already using AI autopilot systems — in which AI handles routine tasks and humans intervene only in critical situations — said Andrew Sun, who heads Nvidia’s (NVDA) AI for retail division. “No one ever feels like you have enough time to do the very manual work, moving a box off a truck, making sure it’s unpacked, getting it onto the shelf at the right price, and serving the customer,” Sun said, noting that the shift could simplify a hard job in a high turnover industry. The AI chip maker is moving beyond gaming and entertainment to look at how AI can make more efficient use of labor and reduce human error – two key factors that can make or break a supply chain. The real win for the retail industry might not be in delivering more sophisticated customer experiences, but in building a stronger, more resilient infrastructure. For now, AI’s on the supply side, but as the tech matures, it will seep more substantially into every customer interaction and companies lagging behind in AI adoption may be in for a rude awakening. “While companies are making strides, the majority are still medium to slow followers in AI adoption,” said Jerry Sheldon, vice president at global research firm IHL Services. “This gap could lead to significant competitive advantages for early adopters and heavy investors.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Apple (AAPL-0.28%) is expected to release its fiscal first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. The company’s shares were up by 3.25% at the market close on Monday, while it reclaimed its title as the most valuable public company in the world from chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-2.74%), which suffered from the global tech sell-off sparked by China’s DeepSeek. The iPhone maker is expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter — an increase of more than 3% from the previous year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.87%). Apple is also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion. Earlier this month, Jefferies (JEF+2.45%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform,” citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” The company rolled out its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, in October, which “has yet to gain traction with consumers,” Jefferies analysts said. Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities. However, the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the older iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro both have three cameras. This potentially makes them more attractive options, especially if they have a lower price tag, Jefferies said. Shipments of the iPhone were also down by 4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, Jefferies noted, citing data from the International Data Corporation. The firm cut iPhone shipment growth expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) fell 33.78% overnight. The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) and T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) plunged 33.8% and 33.77% respectively. All three funds reported their largest loss in a single day, according to data from FactSet. Conversely, funds betting against Nvidia like the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) rose more than 33%. "This sell-off has been a difficult lesson for investors who have seen Nvidia as invincible and have taken aggressive bets on its growth without understanding the risks of single stock ETFs," said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The funds were designed to deliver twice the performance of Nvidia on a single-day basis. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which boasts the largest assets under management out of the three, saw AUM decline by $2.4 billion from its peak last November to $4.3 billion as of Monday, according to data provided by by Global X ETFS. The AUMs of T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) are currently hovering around $419 million and $497 million, respectively. "While these ETFs can magnify gains, they can also magnify losses and may not be appropriate for investors without a high risk tolerance," Islam told CNBC. Since their approval in 2022, single-stock ETFs have seen an explosion in popularity, with over 60 products available in the U.S. worth $18 billion in assets, data from Global X ETFs showed. Single-stock ETFs strive to deliver amplified returns compared to the underlying asset. "In other words, they're more volatile," said Morningstar. "It could be a matter of time before some of them implode depending on the intensity of market movements of individual stocks," said Marc Jocum, product and investment strategist at Global X ETFs. Nvidia lost almost $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in the U.S. The sell-off was triggered by fears of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek intensifying AI competition and calling into question America's dominance in the sector. Last week, DeepSeek launched R1, an open-source reasoning model that was claimed to have taken only two months and less than $6 million to build. It was reported that DeepSeek's reasoning model outperformed Open AI's latest o1 model in several third-party tests. Single-stock ETFs come with a huge risk, however, they can be useful trading tools when employed correctly, in particular for speculators, market watchers told CNBC. These ETFs are best suited for traders who want to take advantage of volatility to express a strong bullish or bearish view over a single day, said Islam. "While they're powerful tools for tactical day traders, they may not suit buy-and-hold long-term investors," warned Jocum. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 experts
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-invest-10000-right-now-market-experts-stocks-bonds-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Do you have $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket? If you're looking to invest it, you've come to the right place. Investing can be tricky. How much should you allocate to stocks and bonds? What if you need the money in five years? When should you come into the market if stocks are in the middle of a volatile period, like they seem to have entered on Monday? Ultimately, everyone has different goals and needs with their money, and deciding where to put it calls for individualized plans that account for timelines and how much potential losses one can stomach. If you're looking for ideas, we've got you covered. In recent weeks, we asked six experts where investors sitting on a chunk of money should consider putting their cash for the months and years ahead. Answers, which came before Monday's stock market sell-off, varied across asset classes and timelines and are listed below. Stock market valuations are high, leading some of Wall Street's biggest names to worry that the S&P 500 is a bubble ready to pop. While Ragan recognizes valuations are elevated, he still sees opportunities for investors to put cash to work. "We're still pretty comfortable adding funds to the market," Ragan told BI. "We still like the S&P 500 and large-cap US equities." Among large-cap companies, technology stocks have pushed the market higher, which is why Ragan believes it's important to maintain a dedicated allocation to tech. "On one hand, we're saying don't get too overweight there, but I think you still want to have exposure in that sector," Ragan said of tech. However, it's important to have diversified sector exposure, and Ragan sees opportunities in communication services, healthcare, and financials. Companies in these sectors tend to have low price-to-earnings-growth ratios, meaning they're undervalued relative to their earnings growth rate. These sectors will also benefit from increased deregulation under President Donald Trump, Ragan said. Dividend stocks are also trading at attractive valuations, he added. These stocks can benefit a portfolio by providing a steady income stream. With rising yields, Ragan also sees opportunities in fixed income, particularly in short-term bonds. Don't just stick with Treasurys, though. Ragan recommends adding corporate and municipal bonds to the mix. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these areas of the market include the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) and the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWY). On the heels of two stellar years for the stock market, Dobler said he's inclined to be a bit more defensive and cautious in the year ahead — especially if an investor is looking at a short-term time horizon. Price-multiple expansion won't come as easy, and investors are going to be looking for real earnings results, he said. Broadly speaking, that boils down to taking a three-part approach: allocating to fixed-income amid robust yields, so-called real assets as inflation stays elevated, and defensive parts of the stock market amid stretched valuations. Within the fixed-income category, Dobler likes investment-grade credit, Treasury inflation-protected securities, and municipal bonds. US money-market funds and high-yield savings accounts are also attractive options, he said. As for real assets, he said real estate, commodities, and infrastructure plays would get a boost as inflation remains sticky. And for defensive stocks, he said quality companies — those with stable and consistent earnings track records — would benefit if growth stocks start to hit trouble like they did in 2022. "The economy is slowing, financial conditions are tightening, and so it'll reward more of a defensive- and quality-focused strategy," Dobler said. Some examples of exchange-traded funds offering exposure to Dobler's ideas include the GMO US Quality ETF (QLTY), the VanEck Real Assets ETF (RAAX), and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). Quinzel believes that US exceptionalism will drive the stock market in 2025. Stocks have posted strong earnings, the US GDP is slated to grow at 2% to 3% this year, and secular tailwinds such as AI will provide a significant boost to the economy, he said. If you're looking to grow $10,000, "you certainly want to have diversified equities, and you certainly want to be focused on the US," Quinzel told BI. In this environment, investors shouldn't feel constrained by the 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, especially if you have a long time horizon, Quinzel said. It's perfectly OK to take advantage of the robust economy and allocate 80%, or even all, of your portfolio to equities, he said. For those who want to add more stability to their portfolios through fixed income, Quinzel recommends steering clear of high-yield bonds and going for Treasurys, corporate credit, and asset-backed securities. Quinzel also echoed Ragan's suggestion that investors branch out from the Magnificent Seven. He sees plenty of opportunities to play the Trump trade, such as financials and industrials. Both of these sectors will benefit from deregulation, M&A activity, onshoring, and defense spending, which Quinzel anticipates will increase under the new administration. Quinzel is also a fan of momentum and quality investing. "One great way to start investing is by simply utilizing funds that have those traits of momentum and quality because both of those can do really well in this kind of late cycle mode that we're in," he said. Funds that provide exposure to these market areas include the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). For those up for a more hands-on project, buying a multifamily property could be a good option, said Brian Rudderow, a real-estate investor and the CEO of HBR Colorado. While that may sound like it's outside the realm of possibility with just $10,000, Rudderow pointed to a Fannie Mae program launched in late 2023 that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy multifamily properties with just a 5% down payment. That's $10,000 for a $200,000 property. That's still relatively cheap for a multifamily property, let alone for a single-family home, in many areas around the US. But they do exist. "If you can find a lower-income city or a cheaper side of town, then you can do it with $10,000," Rudderow said. The monthly mortgage payment on a property at this price point would be around $2,500, Rudderow said. So, if you charged around $1,500 per unit, you could generate a positive cash flow of $500 a month. The stock market performed strongly in 2024, and Milan believes investors should be optimistic about its continued growth. There are plenty of opportunities for investors to put their cash to work. Industrials, financials, and energy are popular sectors for investors looking to take advantage of the Trump trade, Milan said. He also sees individual opportunities within those broad sectors. Investors should keep an eye on energy in particular. "For the first time in a number of years, there's a significant amount of value and strength in the energy sector," Milan said. If Trump's first term is any indicator of what's to come, Milan is bullish that the president's policies will be extremely beneficial for energy companies. Milan is less focused on big oil companies and more interested in natural gas. "Natural gas pipelines are showing extraordinary strength from a momentum standpoint right now," he said. His top picks include Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) and Energy Transfer (ET). Within financials, Milan is bullish on large private equity firms such as Blackstone (BX), Apollo Global Management (APO), and KKR & Co (KKR). "I think we're at the beginning stages of the next evolution within those types of firms, especially with regards to private credit," Milan said. These firms have poured a significant amount of resources into the private credit business, and Milan believes the asset class will take off in the coming years. Looking into the next 12 months, Roberts said he's increasingly leaning into the AI trade with the $2 billion portfolio he manages as infrastructure investment continues to grow. "It's coming, and it's coming fast," Roberts said. Part of that trade means investing in software and chips companies, like Twilio (TWLO), Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD), he said. Another piece of that play is in the energy companies that will provide the power to run data centers, he said. Some of his holdings include American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy (DUK), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and GE Vernova (GEV). But Roberts isn't blanketly bullish on AI-related stocks. Investors will start to put more of an emphasis on fundamentals, he said, and parts of the growth factor may start to get washed out in the year ahead. This may come amid a move into safer, dividend-providing stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), he said. "I think the unobvious trade is a rotation potentially from high-beta growth," Roberts said. "Dividend value has been really ignored over the last couple of years, and it's very out of favor." Jump to

(Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Even if you don't pay much attention to the stock market, chances are you've heard about Nvidia and its share price today. The company broke the record for the biggest one-day loss in value for a company on the US stock market. Nvidia's share price dropped by 17 per cent. This equated to a huge $US593 billion ($948 billion) loss in value — that's nearly $1 trillion in Australian currency. Here's what you need to know about the company everyone's taking about. Nvidia is a technology company that makes chips, systems and software that power things like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and graphics. It was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. At the time, the aim was to "bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets". In 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256, the world's first dedicated PC graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia, which goes by the a four-letter code NVDA on the stock market, became the world's most valuable company in June last year. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. Nvidia suffered a blow in September, when share prices dropped by 9.5 per cent — at the time, it was the deepest ever single-day decline in market value for a US company. That was until Monday, when Nvidia broke its own record. Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU. (Reuters: Robert Galbraith) As of the close of trade on the US stock market on January 27, it was $US118.42. Compare that to just a few weeks ago on January 6, when it was $US149.43 — its highest ever closing price. When you look at the share price across three months, you'll see it's a pretty significant dip: You can see the price taking a dive at the far right side of the graph. (Supplied: Nvidia) Because of the success of an AI chatbot called DeepSeek that creators claim only used cheaper versions of Nvidia chips. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 and touted its chatbot as being just as good as ChatGPT — but free. DeepSeek's AI assistant — a direct competitor to ChatGPT — has become the number one downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. Last week, a research paper was published about DeepSeek's new model called R1 that said it had advanced "reasoning" skills. The kicker was that this model was supposedly created using an earlier, less advanced versions of Nvidia chips. While this claim has been disputed, it still made people wonder how much of a threat this would pose to Nvidia. That's because the paper claimed DeepSeek only spent $US6 million to make it, which is really, really cheap compared to what other AI companies spend. For context, analysts estimate that big US companies will spend $US250 billion this year on AI infrastructure. So this lead people to question if Nvidia would keep making as much money as it had been. This set the wheels in motion for panic among investors, but it wasn't until DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple's app store on Monday that things really took off. Investors started selling their shares and, by the time the US stock market closed, close to $US600 billion had been wiped off the company's market capitalisation or "market cap" — which is the total value of a public company's stock currently held by all its shareholders. At closing, the price of one Nvidia share was $US24.20, or 17 per cent, lower. DeepSeek's success spooked investors. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Obviously losing nearly $US600 billion isn't ideal for any company. But it's worth noting that the stock price for the company is still pretty high. Have a look at this chart, showing the growth of Nvidia's share prices across the past year: The stock price is about double what it was this time last year. (Supplied: Nvidia) You'll see that, even with Monday's losses, it's still worth more than it was last January. On January 29 last year, it was only worth $US62.47 — a little more than half of what it's worth today. And now look at its growth since 2013: Nvidia's stock prices skyrocketed from 2023 — and it is still significantly higher than it was even when you take Monday's losses into account. (Supplied: Nvidia) Nvidia was worth just $US14.32 at the start of 2023, so it's still up by more than 700 per cent in less than two years. It has added more than $US100 to its share price in that time. ABC North America correspondent Carrington Clarke suggests we could be in for a waiting game to see how this pans out for Nvidia. "Often we see in markets when new information is being divested, the immediate concern is perhaps panic," he says. "The concern [is] that lofty expectations about future profits were not based on firm ground. "We [will] wait to see how this is processed. "Nvidia has a history of seeing major sell-offs and then rising again." Take, for example, the September drop — share prices got down to $US102.83 at its lowest point on September 6. A month later, the price had gone up to $US124.92.
