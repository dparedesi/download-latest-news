Title: Everything NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at its CES 2025 keynote

NVIDIA held its CES 2025 keynote last night with CEO Jensen Huang and it was surprisingly eventful. The company finally unveiled its much awaited GeForce RTX 5000 GPUs that promise a considerable performance uplift, to start with. The company didn't stop there, also announcing Project Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, along with DLSS 4 and more. Here's a wrap-up of what happened — and you can watch the whole event uncut, via the YouTube embed below. (Spoiler alert: It's more than 90 minutes long.) Huang strode out in a new snakeskin-like leather jacket and revealed the much-anticipated RTX 5090 GPU. With 32GB of GDDR7 RAM and an impressive 21,760 CUDA cores, the new flagship can deliver up to twice as much relative performance, particularly for ray-tracing (RT) intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077. In fact that particular title ran at 234 fps with full RT on in a video demo, compared to 109 fps on the RTX 4090. It's not cheap, though, priced at $1,999. The company also revealed the $549 RTX 5070 with a far more modest 6,144 CUDA cores and 12GB of DDR7 RAM, along with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $999 RTX 5080. A key part of the RTX 5000-series launch was the introduction of DLSS 4, the latest version of the company's real-time image upscaling technology. It features a new technology called Multi Frame Generation that allows the new GPUs to generate up to three additional frames for every one frame the GPU produces via traditional rendering — helping multiply frame rates by up to eight times. It also represents what NVIDIA calls the "biggest upgrade to its AI models" since DLSS 2, improving things like temporal stability and detail, while reducing artifacts like ghosting. Finally, NVIDIA launched Project Digits, a "personal AI supercomputer" designed for AI researchers, data scientists and students. It uses NVIDIA's new GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, providing up to a petaflop of performance for testing and running AI models. The company says a single Project Digits unit can run models 200 billion parameters in size, or multiple machines can be linked together to run up to 405 billion parameter models. And for its intended audience, Project Digits is relatively cheap at $3,000. On top of all that, the company introduced NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for robot and AV development, the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform for autonomous vehicles and AI Foundation models for RTX PCs "that supercharge digital humans." It's all explained in the video above and NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote blog. CES — and Huang's keynote — are happening against the backdrop of continued volatility in the company's stock price. NVIDIA shares (ticker NVDA) spiked ahead of Huang's address, closing on Monday just shy of Apple's market cap pinnacle. But Tuesday saw a reversal, with the stock down more than 6 percent. Still, some are betting it's a toss up between the two tech giants as to which will hit the $4 trillion market valuation first. Update, January 7 2025, 4:18PM ET: This story has been updated with new details on Nvidia's stock price.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq leads stock declines as traders pare rate cut bets, Nvidia plummets after record close

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's racing to get next-gen Blackwell chips 'into every data center in the world'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects the rollout of its next-gen Blackwell chips to be the company's biggest revenue driver soon. "We're racing to get Blackwells into every data center in the world," Huang said in an interview with Yahoo Finance from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Huang added that he expects Blackwell revenues to eclipse sales of Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper chips "early this year." Analysts expect Nvidia’s data center business to continue its blockbuster growth thanks to the rollout of its Blackwell lineup. In its most recent quarter, nearly 90% of its revenues came from this segment. The company is currently ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. Fourth quarter revenue at Nvidia tallied $35.1 billion. On Monday, Huang spent much of his CES keynote address talking about the opportunity in robotics and self-driving cars, which he expects will be one of the biggest computing industries in the world. "We've been working on self-driving cars now for some time," Huang said, noting that Nvidia’s technology for autonomous driving is already set to generate $5 billion in annual sales for the AI chipmaker. "If it's already a $5 billion business for us, imagine how big it's going to be when we have 100 million new [self-driving] cars per year,” Huang added. "This is likely going to be one of the largest robotics industries in the world and one of the largest computing industries in the world." On Monday, Huang unveiled the company’s Cosmos platform for developers to simulate their self-driving vehicle software, its latest push into the auto market. The executive also unveiled Nvidia’s partnerships with Toyota (TM) and autonomous trucking company Aurora Innovation (AUR), which will use its specialized chips for self-driving vehicle systems. Its newest DRIVE Thor chip for autonomous driving is based on the architecture for its latest Blackwell AI chips. Aurora stock rose more than 30% following the news on Tuesday. Nvidia stock, which opened at a record high on Tuesday, was down more than 5% in afternoon trade. Nvidia's Automotive and Robotics segments currently make up a relatively small portion of its overall revenue. In Q3, the division brought in $449 million compared to its Data Center business, which brought in $30.8 billion of its $35.1 billion in total revenue. At CES, Nvidia also unveiled a new, pint-sized artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its (also new) client supercomputer. The supercomputer — sized to fit on the average-sized desk — is part of Nvidia’s Project DIGITS announced Monday, advertised to developers, researchers, and students. The device will be available in May for $3,000. "In the case of AI, we started in the cloud," Huang told Yahoo Finance. "We're coming into PCs, into personal computers … we want people to be able to access Nvidia AI, however you like to do it."

Nvidia stock (NVDA) fell Tuesday, reversing direction after a rally fueled by CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son has pledged to invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years. Masa's longtime friend and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang weighs in on the pledge. Nvidia announced a host of new software and hardware technologies at CES 2025. Here are the three most important debuts. Nvidia unveiled its latest RTX 50 series of desktop and laptop graphics chips, including the $1,999 RTX 5090.

In a recent interview with the BG2Pod podcast, Nadella talked about the initial AI boom created by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and Microsoft's efforts to catch up in anticipation of the higher demand for AI services. Nadella was asked about Microsoft's constraints right now and said, "Power yes ... I am not chip supply constrained." The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has taken the stock market by storm. Wall Street is currently fixated on AI agents, which differ slightly from traditional AI copilots. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is well positioned to capitalize on that spending, and the stock price is quite attractive. What companies should consider before making major decisions. Topping the list of 10 stocks is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing — also known as TSMC stock.

Title: Nvidia Is Officially on the A.I. Agents Train With New Family of LLM Models

Nvidia (NVDA) is going all-in on A.I. agents as it seeks to cash in on what CEO Jensen Huang calls a “multi-trillion dollar opportunity” that could change how IT teams operate. During his keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) yesterday (Jan. 6) in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s Nemotron family of large language models that developers can use to build A.I. agents—autonomous bots that can perform complex tasks without human control.

Applications include customer support, fraud detection, and inventory management optimization. By deploying A.I. agents, companies can “achieve unprecedented productivity,” according to the company. “In the future, these A.I. agents are essentially a digital workforce that are working alongside your employees doing things for you on your behalf,” Huang said during his keynote. “The way you would bring these specialized agents into your company is to onboard them just like you would on-board an employee.” In a live demonstration, Huang showcased examples of A.I. agents with digital replicas of his face. The A.I. research assistant agent for students, for instance, is designed to take documents like lectures, academic journals and financial results and synthesize them into an interactive podcast for “easy learning.” The software security agent can scan software and alert developers if vulnerabilities are detected so they can take immediate action. Other A.I. agents displayed included roles like financial analyst, employee support and factory operations. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of A.I. agents in the future,” Huang said. Major companies are already lining up to use Nvidia’s Nemotron models. One early user is the enterprise software giant SAP. Philipp Herzig, chief A.I. officer at SAP, said in a release the company expects “hundreds of millions of enterprise users” to interact with Nvidia’s A.I. agents to “accomplish their goals faster than ever before,” Another enterprise software giant, ServiceNow, will use Nvidia’s new models to “build advanced A.I. agent services” that can solve a complex range of problems in a move to “achieve more with less effort,” Jeremy Barnes, the company’s vice president of platform A.I., said in a release. Nemotron is just one of many products Huang announced during his nearly two-hour-long keynote. The CEO also unveiled a new family of its latest Blackwell chips which the company claims is three times more powerful than previous generations of GPUs. The Blackwell family is expected to create a $100 billion market opportunity for Nvidia, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in a note last November. On top of that, Huang announced the GB200 NVl2, a super chip that it claims will supercharge the capacity for data centers to run A.I. workloads. Nvidia isn’t just betting big on its highly sought-after chips. Huang also announced the Cosmos foundation model to advance physical A.I. like humanoid robots, the DRIVE Hyperion platform to train self-driving vehicles, and Project Digits, a $3,000 personal supercomputer that Nvidia says is 1,000 times more powerful than a typical laptop. Nvidia also announced two autonomous driving partnerships, one with Toyota and the other with Aurora, a self-driving truck startup. The latest A.I. developments cements Nvidia’s position as a global leader in the A.I. revolution. Prior to Huang’s speech, Nvidia’s stock jumped more than 3.4 percent to a record high of $149.43 per share after market close in anticipation of the CES announcements. That surge sent Nvidia’s market value up to $3.47 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s. Nvidia’s market value grew by over $2 trillion last year.

Title: Nvidia's (NVDA) Conference Fails to Reverse Crypto AI Token Downswing
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/07/ai-tokens-fail-to-mirror-2024s-epic-surge-despite-bullish-nvidia-conference

Artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nividia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. This year, however, AI tokens have shown their fragility. NEAR is down by more than 8% in the past 24 hours while FET slumped nearly 9%. NVDA in contrast began the year trading at $133 and rose by 15% to $153 on Monday as the conference began. There are several reasons why AI tokens are no longer getting the attention they once received. One of those is the emergence of AI agent tokens, which share similarities with memecoins due to their volatile nature and cult-like followings. Investors are more inclined to trade these tokens as they have the potential for triple, even quadruple-digit gains compared to regular AI tokens, which are harder to move due to their larger market caps. And just like memecoins, AI agent tokens have more potential for deeper losses as well. Another reason is simply a lack of interest; Google search trend show that searches for "NEAR token" and "Fetch.ai" are down by 47% and 84% respectively since March. The fall from grace is hardly surprising, the crypto market is very fickle and has a habit of punishing sectors that rise rapidly in a speculative nature. Last year's rally was exactly this: people invested in AI tokens as they believed it would be the primary narrative of the crypto bull market, but instead, it was bitcoin that stole the show with 10's of billions dollars of ETF inflows and bullish sentiment around Donald Trump's presidential victory. AI tokens are still in their infancy, however. Few crypto AI projects were used in the mainstream, as many of the products were still being built. Nvidia, meanwhile, announced a $3,000 mini supercomputer called Digits, which will be available to purchase in May. Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.18%) shares tumbled Tuesday morning after rallying the previous day to close at an all-time high. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 4% during late morning trading — a reverse after climbing 2.5% at the market open and setting a new intraday all-time high of $153.13. The previous day, Nvidia’s shares climbed more than 3% to reach a record close of $149.43 per share — cents higher than its previous record close of $148.88 in early November. The chipmaker’s shares rallied Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual Las Vegas trade show Monday night. The chip leader also unveiled its next generation RTX Blackwell GPUs for gaming ranging between $549 and $1,999. To end the keynote, Huang announced Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer that can run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — more than OpenAI’s GPT-3. The device, which is aimed toward AI researchers and developers, will be available from Nvidia and its partners in May, and starts at $3,000. The chipmaker designed the AI supercomputer with Taiwanese semiconductor company MediaTek. The chip company’s Taiwan-listed shares were up by 4.5% at the market close. Ahead of Huang’s keynote, Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note, with research analyst Vivek Arya describing CES as “a positive catalyst” for the chipmaker. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said about the chipmaker’s robotics strategy. In a note on Tuesday, Bank of America maintained its buy rating on its top pick, and Arya said Huang’s keynote highlighted the chipmaker’s “continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains as cautious investors weighed new economic data in the midst of Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell around 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.1%. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI indicated the manufacturing sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," wrote Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Less hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from the 2.1% seen in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. In corporates, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall around 5% after hitting a record high close. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Despite Nvidia's declines, other chip stocks extended their rally, with Micron Technology (MU) up about 4% and Asia names making gains. Meanwhile, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: The Market Survived The Holidays. Now What?

By Greg Guenthner Posted January 7, 2025 We waited (and waited) for stocks to find a bottom and recover during the December slide. Then, we crossed our fingers for a low-volume melt up in that magical window between Christmas and New Year’s Day. But nothing happened. Santa was a no-show over our little holiday break. We were instead hit with wave after wave of selling as speculators ditched their broken trades and pouted about the lumps of coal filling the pages of their brokerage accounts. Perhaps I suffer from a fair amount of stock market PTSD, because the failed December rally prompted flashbacks of late 2021. If you have a short memory, this was exactly when the market started to show serious signs of cracking lower, which it promptly did as the final stalwart stocks broke through support in January 2022, dragging investors into a grinding bear market that lasted almost the entire calendar year. Fortunately for the bulls, the market stabilized when the calendar flipped to January. So it’s a bit premature to begin leaning on any bearish calls. Not yet, anyway. Today, we’ll dig into what’s ailing this market. I’ll explain what I think is going on since the melt-up stalled in early December, where stocks might be headed in 2025, and the tickers you need to watch to keep up with the snapback moves that are brewing this week. First up: let’s talk about the Santa Rally phenomenon. Technically, the Santa Claus Rally is a period of unusual market strength falling on the final five trading days of the year, and finishing up on the second trading day of the new year. No, stock’s don’t have to go up during this low-volume period. But they tend to do just that as investors and traders “get ahead” of the best plays of the next calendar year. Here’s the thing… When it comes to these little seasonal quirks, we tend to gain more information when they fail to materialize. Everyone was watching and waiting for choice holiday trading conditions. When the big man didn’t show (and stocks continued to drop), speculators started to get worried. Is the market completely broken after Santa failed to show? Not quite! Here’s my best guess to explain what’s going on: First, Trump’s victory emboldened the bulls and pulled much of what would have been the December melt-up gains ahead by about a month. November featured a massive crypto breakout and a stock market run that featured some bubbly groups extending higher. I think it’s fair to say that the market became way too frothy by the time December rolled around. That’s when market breadth began to deteriorate. Fewer and fewer stocks were moving higher, and we once again found ourselves in a market propped up by the mega-caps as crypto pulled back, many of the snapback tech-growth names cooled, and investors started to get more defensive. Yes, there’s still plenty of froth out there. But the market’s sluggish holiday performance caused some ugly numbers to creep into the picture. For starters, the percentage of stocks outperforming the S&P hit an all-time low over the holiday break, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This adds even more fuel to the arguments about a few big stocks propping up the rest of the market… Next, we witnessed a handful of failed breakouts – small-caps, biotechs, and many of the popular growth stocks are the most prominent names that ripped above resistance, only to get yanked right back down once the market softened. Then there are some not-so-bullish seasonality patterns emerging. Now that it’s January, we’re entering a bit of a soft spot for the market. One of the worst quarters during the four-year Presidential Cycle starts now, Carson Research’s Ryan Detrick reminds us. In year one of the presidential cycle, Q1 is the weakest. The Stock Trader’s Almanac also says that a failed Santa rally can precede bear markets, or at the very least time where stocks can be found at lower prices later in the year. While I don’t think the sky is falling, I do believe we should do our best to keep our heads on straight as we dive deeper into the first quarter. Trading conditions could get more difficult by February. Perhaps we see new highs in the averages, followed by some chop and then the beginning of that elusive 10% pullback that the market has managed to avoid (the last one ended in Oct. 2023). Are conditions about to get a lot more difficult over the next three months? This question continues to run through my mind as stocks continue to recover this week. For now, we’ll see if some of these fresh 2025 bounces stick. If the market continues to recover from here, we might enjoy a little pre-earnings season rally for a couple of weeks. While I’m staying tactically long here, I’m still on alert for any evidence that supports a weakening market. If I do start to see these cracks widen, it will be time to look for some downside plays. Here’s what you should be watching this week to help cut through the noise: Semiconductors: The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is beginning to break out of a six-month consolidation this week. It’s hard to be bearish if the chip stocks are back on top, and NVIDIA Inc. (NVDA) is back to teasing all-time highs following Monday’s 3.4% rally. Tech-growth: Many of the tech snapback trades fell flat over the holidays. But our tech-hype proxy ARK Innovation (ARKK) is working to get back on track after just barely kissing its 50-day moving average. If these “growthier” tech names can make another run, the market’s likely repairing our late December breadth worries… Crypto: The air came out of Bitcoin just before the holidays as the flagship crypto fell from a high of $108K all the way down into the low 90K range, revisiting support from late November. But crypto started perking up again late last week, and Bitcoin was able to sneak back above the magical $100K level to kick off the trading week. Bitcoin (and the rest of the crypto space) did exactly what the bulls needed. It established a floor without eating too much into its early November rally. It’s safe to assume that with crypto moving higher to kick off 2025, there’s still plenty of speculative firepower left out there. Bottom line: If these charts continue to look healthy, there’s no need to get too bearish over shorter time frames. But if we do see market conditions deteriorate, we’ll discuss ways to prepare (and profit!) in the days and weeks ahead.

Micron Technologies (MU) is climbing for a second straight day after Nvidia (NVDA) noted that it was using MU's chips in its new products. After advancing 10.5% yesterday, the shares are climbing 6% today. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reported yesterday that Micron's high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) chips were being incorporated into NVDA's new GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell gaming chips. 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors Considered a key component of AI, HBM has been an important growth engine for Micron. During the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call, held on Dec. 18, Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana noted that HBM, combined with SSD chips, had enabled the company's revenue from data centers to soar 400% versus the same period a year earlier during the quarter. Adding that HBM had become a multiple billion-dollar business, Sadana noted that more than half of the company's revenue was being generated by data centers. Foxconn's Strong Results and Micron's Presence on Evercore's List MU stock was also likely lifted yesterday by the slightly stronger-than-expected Q4 results reported by electronics maker Foxconn. The largest manufacturer of Apple's (AAPL) iPhones, Taiwan-based Foxconn reported Q4 sales of 2.13 trillion New Taiwan dollars or $65 billion. Analysts had expected the company’s revenue to come in at 2.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars, according to an average compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate. Micron sells chips to Apple. Also yesterday, Micron was included on a list of stocks called “AI Enablers, Adopters and Adapters.” Compiled by investment bank Evercore ISI, the list includes members of the Russell 3000 index whose market caps are above $3 billion and whose previous earnings calls include more references to AI than average for Russell 2000 members in the previous four quarters. Additionally, the stocks on the had to have had a positive reaction to their earnings, while their forward P/E ratios trade below their five-year average. Finally, Evercore ISI predicts that the earnings per share of all of the names on the list will increase by at least 9.6%. While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Benchmark On NVIDIA’s CES Keynote Address: “We Believe Many Investors Were Hoping For More Concrete Progress Updates On The Ramp Of Blackwell And Some Input As To The Company’s Progress With Its Next Generation GPU Platform, Rubin”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. By all accounts, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang managed to deliver on elevated expectations during his CES keynote address, one that Wedbush's Dan Ives describes as imbued with more of "a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech." However, the address did not satiate the ravenous appetites of all listeners, as per the latest commentary from the investment banking firm Benchmark. $NVDA Buy Following CES - Benchmark While Jensen Huang, as expected delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements that together further extend the company’s hardware and software… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) January 7, 2025 To wit, while conceding that NVIDIA's Jensen Huang "delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements," Benchmark believes that "many investors were hoping for more concrete progress updates on the ramp of Blackwell and some input as to the company’s progress with its next generation GPU platform, Rubin." Benchmark did take pains to highlight Huang's declaration that NVIDIA's latest Blackwell platform was in full production phase now, but asserted that most of the content of the keynote address was "already well understood by the market and again there was zero mention of Rubin, although to be fair, this next-generation design is not expected until 2026." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Huang touched on the following points in his CES keynote address on Monday (the list also includes several material developments that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the address): Coming back, Benchmark does feel that, on the whole, Huang's keynote address provided "a strong kick-off to this year’s CES." The firm, therefore, reiterated its 'Buy' rating for NVIDIA shares, replete with a $190 stock price target, which implies a 25 percent upside potential relative to the current price level.

Shares in artificial Intelligence (AI) favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will remain in the spotlight on Tuesday after CEO Jensen Huang provided several important technology updates last night during his keynote address at the CES 2025 conference in Las Vegas. During the highly anticipated event, Huang unveiled next generation AI-powered gaming chips, introduced technology that speeds up the training of robots, launched the chipmaker’s first desktop computer and announced a deal with Japanese automaker, Toyota (TM). Nvidia is coming off another banner year during which insatiable demand for AI infrastructure helped drive its stock price up about 170%. Those gains followed a more than three-fold increase in 2023. Nvidia shares, which hit a record closing high of $149.43 on Monday, were up another 2.5% in recent premarket trading and poised to hit an all-time intraday high today. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching as investors react to Huang’s CES update. Nvidia shares broke out above the top trendline of a descending channel on Friday, with bullish momentum continuing into Monday’s trading session ahead of Huang’s presentation. While the stock set a record closing high yesterday, the price closed significantly below its intraday peak to form a shooting star, a candlestick pattern that can signal a potential reversal. Looking ahead, investors should watch for increasing trading volume, which would signal conviction behind recent buying. Although share turnover registered its highest level in more than a week on Monday, it remains below longer-term averages, suggesting that larger market participants remain on the sidelines. Let’s identify several key overhead areas to watch on Nvidia's chart and also point out two major support levels that may come into focus during retracements. The first immediate overhead area to watch sits around $150. While the price has traded above this key level on multiple occasion since early November, it has failed to decisively close above it. To project a potential price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the bars pattern tool. This works by extracting the uptrend from April to June last year and repositioning it from last month’s low. Such analysis forecasts a target of around $225, about 50% above Monday’s closing price. We selected the prior trend because it began from the lower trendline of an earlier descending channel on the chart, closely replicating how the current move higher has started. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $140 level. Those who prefer not to chase breakouts may look for entry points in this area near the descending channel’s top trendline, which also closely aligns with the stock’s prominent June peak. Finally, the bulls’ inability to defend this area could see Nvidia shares retrace to around $130, a location on the chart where the may find support near the August swing high and December swing low.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures held steady on Tuesday as cautious investors weighed Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans and puzzled over tariff prospects, with fresh jobs data on deck. Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) were up 0.1%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) inched higher by 0.2%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) hovered around the flatline. Buzz around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote is providing a bright spot for markets used to moving tentatively amid uncertainty around policy from the incoming Trump administration. Shares in Nvidia rose over 2% in pre-market, coming off hitting a record high close, after Huang revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Chip stocks extended their rally in its wake, with Micron Technology (MU) up over 5% and Asia names making gains. At the same time, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) continued to come under pressure, having sunk to one-week lows. An update on JOLTS job openings in November later in the day will feed into the debate over the path of interest rates, as well as setting the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation.

Title: Nvidia goes all in on AI agents and humanoid robots at CES

As the AI world races toward next-generation breakthroughs, Nvidia (NVDA-0.18%) fortified its position with a flood of new chips, software and services designed to keep the industry plugged into its expanding tech ecosystem. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang announced a suite of AI tools and updates during the first keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Monday, focusing on AI agents — systems that can complete tasks autonomously. Huang demonstrated these capabilities through animated versions of himself in different outfits, showing how AI agents could handle roles like customer service, coding, and research assistance. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future,” Huang said in the keynote. The chipmaker unveiled AI Blueprints, which will help companies build and deploy these AI agents using technology built on Meta’s (META-1.54%) Llama models. These “knowledge robots,” as Nvidia describes them, can analyze large amounts of data, summarize information from videos and PDFs, and take actions based on what they learn. To make this happen, Nvidia partnered with five leading AI companies — CrewAI, Daily, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Weights & Biases — who will help integrate Nvidia’s technology into usable tools for businesses. “These AI agents act like ‘knowledge robots’ that can reason, plan and take action to quickly analyze large quantities of data, summarize and distill real-time insights from video, PDF and other images,” Justin Boitano, Nvidia’s vice president of enterprise AI software products said in a statement. Nvidia also made a major push into robotics, unveiling new tools to help companies simulate and deploy robot workforces. The centerpiece is “Mega,” a new Omniverse Blueprint that lets companies develop, test, and optimize robot fleets in virtual environments before deploying them in real warehouses and factories. “The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,” Huang said during his keynote. To back this claim, Nvidia announced a collection of robot foundation models, including new capabilities for generating synthetic motion data for training humanoid robots. The company says these pre-trained models were developed using massive amounts of data, including millions of hours of autonomous driving and drone footage. A key part of this effort is the new Isaac GR00T Blueprint, which helps solve a major challenge in robotics: generating the massive amounts of motion data needed to train humanoid robots. Instead of the expensive and time-consuming process of collecting real-world data, developers can use GR00T to generate large synthetic datasets from just a small number of human motions. “Collecting these extensive, high-quality datasets in the real world is tedious, time-consuming, and often prohibitively expensive,” Nvidia said in a press release. With the Isaac GR00T blueprint, developers can generate the large data sets needed to train AI models from a small number of human motions. The new tools are already attracting major industry players. KION Group, a supply chain solutions company, is working with Accenture (ACN+0.24%) to use Nvidia’s Mega blueprint to optimize warehouse operations that involve both human workers and robots. Nvidia’s efforts into the physical world didn’t stop there: it announced the expansion of its automobile partners, including with the world’s largest automaker, which will use its accelerated computing and AI for driving assistance capabilities and autonomous vehicles. Toyota (TM-0.53%) will use Nvidia’s DRIVE AGX Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for its next-generation vehicles for driving assistance. Meanwhile, the chipmaker said Aurora (AUR-4.11%) and Continental will both use Nvidia’s DRIVE accelerated compute to deploy driverless trucks through a long-term strategic partnership. On the consumer front — it is CES, after all — Huang showed off the next generation of its RTX Blackwell GPUs, with the four versions priced between $549 and $1,999. The popular gaming chips will be released later this month and in February. And to cap off the keynote, Huang lifted the curtain on Project DIGITS, a palm-sized personal AI supercomputer powerful enough to run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters while GPT-4 is rumored to have 1.76 trillion parameters. The device, which will be available starting at $3,000 from Nvidia and its partners in May, aims to put AI development in more hands. “AI will be mainstream in every application for every industry,” Huang said in a statement. “With Project DIGITS, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers. Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.” Nvidia stock was up 4% before Huang’s CES keynote, with Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday, with an analyst describing CES as a “positive catalyst” for the company. The stock closed at a record high of $149.43. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

With these blueprints, developers can create podcasts from PDF documents, generate stunning images guided by 3D scenes and more. The blueprint for PDF to podcast extracts text, images and tables from a PDF to create a podcast script that can be edited by users. It can also generate a full audio recording from the script using voices available in the blueprint or based on a user's voice sample. In addition, users can have a real-time conversation with the AI podcast host to learn more about specific topics. The blueprint uses NIM microservices like Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct for language, NVIDIA Riva for text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition, and the NeMo Retriever collection of microservices for PDF extraction. The AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI gives artists finer control over image generation. While AI can generate amazing images from simple text prompts, controlling image composition using only words can be challenging. With this blueprint, creators can use simple 3D objects laid out in a 3D renderer like Blender to guide AI image generation. The artist can create 3D assets by hand or generate them using AI, place them in the scene and set the 3D viewport camera. Then, a prepackaged workflow powered by the FLUX NIM microservice will use the current composition to generate high-quality images that match the 3D scene. NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints will be available starting in February with initial hardware support for GeForce RTX 50 Series, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional GPUs. Additional GPUs will be supported in the future.

January 06, 2025 22:06 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA LAS VEGAS, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today unveiled the most advanced consumer GPUs for gamers, creators and developers — the GeForce RTX™ 50 Series Desktop and Laptop GPUs. Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor Cores and fourth-generation RT Cores, the GeForce RTX 50 Series delivers breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry and lighting. “Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Fusing AI-driven neural rendering and ray tracing, Blackwell is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.” The GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — the fastest GeForce RTX GPU to date — features 92 billion transistors, providing over 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS) of computing power. Blackwell architecture innovations and DLSS 4 mean the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU by up to 2x. GeForce Blackwell comes to laptops with all the features of desktop models, bringing a considerable upgrade to portable computing, including extraordinary graphics capabilities and remarkable efficiency. The Blackwell generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology extends battery life by up to 40%, and includes thin and light laptops that maintain their sleek design without sacrificing power or performance. NVIDIA DLSS 4 Boosts Performance by Up to 8xDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. It works in unison with the suite of DLSS technologies to increase performance by up to 8x over traditional rendering, while maintaining responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex technology. DLSS 4 also introduces the graphics industry’s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture. Transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models use 2x more parameters and 4x more compute to provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scenes. DLSS 4 will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs in over 75 games and applications the day of launch. NVIDIA Reflex 2 introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technique to reduce latency in games by updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display. Reflex 2 can reduce latency by up to 75%. This gives gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games and makes single-player titles more responsive. Blackwell Brings AI to ShadersTwenty-five years ago, NVIDIA introduced GeForce 3 and programmable shaders, which set the stage for two decades of graphics innovation, from pixel shading to compute shading to real-time ray tracing. Alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX Neural Shaders, which brings small AI networks into programmable shaders, unlocking film-quality materials, lighting and more in real-time games. Rendering game characters is one of the most challenging tasks in real-time graphics, as people are prone to notice the smallest errors or artifacts in digital humans. RTX Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face and 3D pose data as input, and uses generative AI to render a temporally stable, high-quality digital face in real time. RTX Neural Faces is complemented by new RTX technologies for ray-traced hair and skin. Along with the new RTX Mega Geometry, which enables up to 100x more ray-traced triangles in a scene, these advancements are poised to deliver a massive leap in realism for game characters and environments. The power of neural rendering, DLSS 4 and the new DLSS transformer model is showcased on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with Zorah, a groundbreaking new technology demo from NVIDIA. Autonomous Game CharactersGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs bring industry-leading AI TOPS to power autonomous game characters in parallel with game rendering. NVIDIA is introducing a suite of new NVIDIA ACE technologies that enable game characters to perceive, plan and act like human players. ACE-powered autonomous characters are being integrated into KRAFTON’s PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS and InZOI, the publisher’s upcoming life simulation game, as well as Wemade Next’s MIR5. In PUBG, companions powered by NVIDIA ACE plan and execute strategic actions, dynamically working with human players to ensure survival. InZOI features Smart Zoi characters that autonomously adjust behaviors based on life goals and in-game events. In MIR5, large language model (LLM)-driven raid bosses adapt tactics based on player behavior, creating more dynamic, challenging encounters. AI Foundation Models for RTX AI PCsShowcasing how RTX enthusiasts and developers can use NVIDIA NIM microservices to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices and AI Blueprints for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span LLMs, vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation, PDF extraction and computer vision. The NIM microservices include all the necessary components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across all NVIDIA GPUs. To demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user’s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more. AI-Powered Tools for CreatorsThe GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs supercharge creative workflows. RTX 50 Series GPUs are the first consumer GPUs to support FP4 precision, boosting AI image generation performance for models such as FLUX by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware. The NVIDIA Broadcast app gains two AI-powered beta features for livestreamers: Studio Voice, which upgrades microphone audio, and Virtual Key Light, which relights faces for polished streams. Streamlabs is introducing the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, powered by NVIDIA ACE and Inworld AI, which acts as a cohost, producer and technical assistant to enhance livestreams.

Several stocks, including Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA, look to have a strong year on the back of their AI-related offerings and services. Let’s take a closer look at each. Broadcom has quickly risen to the top concerning AI players, with its latest set of quarterly results fully confirming robust demand. Its FY24 has just ended, with annual revenue of $51.6 billion reflecting a new record and growing 44% year-over-year on the back of strong demand for its solutions. Impressively, record annual semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion in FY24 was driven by its leading AI XPUs, with AI revenue overall growing 220% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Broadcom’s earnings outlook has also shifted positively across the board following the latest set of results, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its next quarterly results are scheduled for March, with early consensus expectations alluding to 36% EPS growth on 22% higher sales. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Palantir’s robust share performance has been fueled by the AI frenzy, with the company’s latest set of quarterly results pleasing investors in a big way.

Title: Nvidia stock pops ahead of Jensen Huang's CES keynote. Here's what investors can expect to hear from the top chip exec, according to BofA.

Nvidia stock surged 5% on Monday and was edging close to record highs as investors awaited CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech. at the Consumer Electronics Show. Shares of Nvidia hit an intra-day high of $152.16, just shy of its record high of $152.89. Huang is scheduled to kick off CES with an opening speech on Monday at 6:30 p.m. PST in Las Vegas. Bank of America noted that Nvidia stock tends to surge around Jensen Huang's CES remarks. The stock jumped 6.4% on the day of Huang's CES speech in 2024, which was followed by an extended surge in the two days following his speech. "It was a monstrous Monday, with NVDA being the most notable move," Bank of America said in a recent note. "NVDA had been extremely range bound for the 4-5 months heading into it, and the buyside was obsessed with the inevitable cloud capex cliff." The bank alluded to the fact that Nvidia is facing a similar setup heading into this year's trade show as investors continue to worry about the possibility of an end to the AI capex boom. Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has traded in a sideways range for about six months. For Huang's upcoming CES speech, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said the integration of AI into robotics could be a big topic of discussion. "We look for updates on Robotics strategy from silicon to software and emergence of 'physical AI' theme," Arya said, adding that he expects Nvidia to make "a strong push" into robotics. Other areas Arya is watching include Nvidia's launch of new PC gaming cards that will be variants of its next-generation AI chip architecture, Blackwell, and the potential for Nvidia to enter the PC market via an AI PC that would likely be made via a partnership but could also be a standalone Nvidia product. Arya is also looking for an update on Nvidia's data center business, specifically surrounding the ongoing ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell chips and upgraded variants expected to launch in the second half of the year, including the GB300 and B300. Finally, Arya said he expects a teaser from Nvidia on its Rubin AI GPU, which is scheduled to succeed the Blackwell chip in 2026. "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA's platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets," Arya said. Analysts at Citi also have Nvidia stock on "positive catalyst watch" during this week's CES event. Arya rates Nvidia at "Buy" and calls it a "top pick" with a $190 price target, representing upside of 26% from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Nvidia stock jumps 4% before CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote

Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.18%) shares climbed by close to 5% on Monday in anticipation of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. The chipmaker is expected to make major artificial intelligence-focused product announcements at the annual Las Vegas trade show. Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday outlining its expectations for CES. “[W]e still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets,” Vivek Arya, a research analyst at Bank of America Global Research, said in the note. Arya said the bank is expecting updates on Nvidia’s robotics strategy, such as its Jetson Thor robot computer, which would leverage its silicon and software capabilities for physical AI. “The challenge in our view is however making the products reliable enough, cheap enough and pervasive enough to spawn credible business models,” Arya said, adding that robotics could be seen as “cool but niche,” similar to the metaverse and autonomous cars. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said. Bank of America is also looking for Nvidia to announce the launch of its RTX 50-series GPUs, “[p]otential entry into” the AI PC market through a partnership or on its own, and updates to its data center business, including on its current-generation Blackwell platform. The chipmaker’s shares stalled toward the end of last year after reaching record highs driven by the AI boom. Production and shipping of the highly anticipated Blackwell chips were delayed due to a now-fixed design flaw that sent its shares falling. The company also saw its shares tumble after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws. In June, Huang announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for this year and a next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin coming in 2026. Arya said announcements on “timeline acceleration” for Rubin could help the chipmaker “regain control of the (overstated) narrative around custom-chips from cloud vendors overtaking/reducing need to buy NVDA’s merchant silicon.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
