Title: Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears

The jobs report was so broadly strong that it signaled the end of the recent labor market cooling ... [+] trend. The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger. Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000. Monthly Job Growth The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%. Unemployment Rate Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January. Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks. Initial Jobless Claims Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well. Stock Returns Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting. U.S. CPI Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Friday’s job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue.

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is gearing up to showcase new tech at its 2024 Advancing AI event on Thursday, which Bank of America analysts said could be a "catch-up catalyst" for the chipmaker. AMD is expected to highlight its line of Instinct GPU accelerators and EPYC server processors at the event, and could potentially offer a glimpse into how it plans to capture a larger share of the AI accelerator market. Analysts expect a followup to AMD’s MI300 series of accelerators launched in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company is off to a strong start in its first year of accelerator sales, Bank of America analysts said in a note Wednesday, guiding for more than $4.5 billion in sales this year. The big question is how large of a market share can it command with Nvidia (NVDA) dominating the AI sector. The current analyst consensus suggests that AMD is expected to hold a roughly 5% to 7% share of the AI accelerator market over the next couple years (while Nvidia's share is north of 80%). However, if it could show a path to 10% by the end of 2026, the company would add about $5 billion in sales, Bank of America said. What could help is the announcement of high-profile companies that use AMD's MI300 series accelerators. Analysts said they believe AMD's MI300X is already used by Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Meta (META), and others could be announced at the event. Shares of AMD jumped nearly 10% the day after last year’s AI event in December, and could surge again after this year's event. The stock climbed nearly 5% Friday to $170.90 and is up about 16% so far this year, thanks to surging AI demand.

Title: NVIDIA’s Blackwell Now In “Full-Force” Production ; Jensen Says That The Demand Is “Insane”

Time Published: 2024-10-04T08:40:36Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang has revealed that the next-gen Blackwell AI product portfolio is already in production and that demand is "insane." Team Green's Blackwell AI architecture has been a victim of "supposed" delays after it was initially said that the firm had faced an issue with the packaging technology incorporated in the architecture. It was said that NVIDIA would delay Blackwell into Q1 2025, but later on, Jensen revealed that Blackwell is on track, shipping by Q4 2024, but in small quantities. In an interview with CNBC, here is what NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang had to say: The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, this new AI infrastructure generation every single year, and so we're going to update our platform every single year. And, the reason for that is if we can increase the performance as we've done with Hopper to Blackwell by 2-3x each year we're effectively increasing the revenues or the throughput of our customers on these infrastructures by a couple (2-3x) each year, decrease, or how you can think about it decreasing cost every 2 or 3 years. - NVIDIA's CEO via CNBC Another interesting point announced by NVIDIA's CEO in the interview is that the firm is working towards reducing energy consumption by its AI products. However, given the vigorous innovation cycle the firm is currently in, they have faced difficulties in this matter. Jensen claims that everything is on track, and NVIDIA is spot-on regarding following product roadmaps. However, there are inconsistencies present, which we'll talk about next. It was recently reported by the prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that NVIDIA plans to halt the development of its GB200 NVL36*2 AI server racks and will instead only offer NVL36 and NVL72 servers to its clients. It was said that Team Green is facing manufacturing complexities and that moving with three different AI server configurations is difficult for the firm. While this certainly doesn't mean that the future of Blackwell is at stake, it does show that even a firm as large as NVIDIA is facing manufacturing and supply troubles. Nvidia $NVDA CEO just said the demand for Nvidia’s next chip Blackwell is “insane” pic.twitter.com/B7IoVnLwwQ — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 2, 2024 NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is right on its way to being the firm's "most successful" product in its history, and based on the initial impression shown by the likes of Jensen, Blackwell is going to be explosive for the markets.

OpenAI's latest fundraising round has made the ChatGPT maker one of the world's most valuable startups, and an unusually costly investment from a historical perspective. On Wednesday, Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion fundraising round that valued the nonprofit startup at the center of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) craze at more than $150 billion, nearly double its valuation just a few months ago. If OpenAI were a public company in the S&P 500, it would be among the index’s 70 largest components and have a market value roughly equivalent to that of AT&T (T) and Pfizer (PFE). But OpenAI, if it was a public company, wouldn’t be eligible for the S&P 500 because it's never been profitable. Nor have many of its major competitors like Amazon (AMZN)-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, or Safe SuperIntelligence (SSI), the organization born out of the recent schism between OpenAI and its former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. The valuations of AI startups have skyrocketed this year as they’ve attracted billions of dollars in investment from tech giants and venture capital firms. Anthropic is in the midst of a fundraising round and is expected to be valued at as much as $40 billion. xAI has been valued at $24 billion and SSI is worth an estimated $5 billion just three months after its founding. These unprofitable firms trade at a high multiple. A Deutsche Bank analysis estimates Anthropic is likely to be valued at 50 times its full-year sales, while OpenAI is valued at almost 40x sales. At the height of the dotcom bubble, Microsoft's and Oracle's (ORCL) price-to-sales ratios peaked around 30. Their valuations also dwarf those of America's largest tech companies. Nvidia (NVDA), expected to book $90 billion in profit in the next year, trades at 30x annual sales. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft, two of the most profitable companies in the world, trade at price-to-sales ratios in the low teens. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit organization with a for-profit arm through which investors can stake a claim to future profits. Last month, reports emerged that the company was planning to convert to a for-profit company, and its latest fundraising reportedly made the investments conditional on its completing that conversion in the next two years. Even so, it could be a while before the company does turn a profit. OpenAI as a whole is expected to lose $5 billion this year, according to analyses by The New York Times and The Information. The number of monthly users of its chatbot ChatGPT, OpenAI's main source of revenue, more than tripled between March and June of this year, and ChatGPT's revenue is expected to quadruple to $2.7 billion this year. But those users come at a high cost—renting the servers to run ChatGPT will cost an estimated $4 billion this year. Growing revenue will be vital to the profitability of OpenAI, and the company has set ambitious goals for itself. According to documents reviewed by the Times, the company expects to grow sales from nearly $4 billion this year to $11.6 billion in 2025. It's targeting $100 billion in revenue in 2029, which would require a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 90% over the next five years. By comparison, analysts forecast Nvidia's revenue will grow at a CAGR of 33% through 2026.

Title: Why Vistra Stock Jumped to Another Record High on Thursday

The gains keep coming for shares of independent power producer Vistra Corp. (VST), which jumped more than 5% on Thursday to notch one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and set a new record closing high. The Texas-based electricity provider has ridden a wave of enthusiasm about using nuclear capacity to power energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) processes. These AI-driven expectations have helped Vistra surpass Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, up a whopping 244% year to date. The most recent push higher for the red-hot Vistra stock came after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), said the tech giant is exploring ways to power its data centers using electricity from nuclear plants. Vistra shares gained 5.7% on Thursday to close at $132.45, bucking a broader downturn for U.S. stocks. In an interview with Japan's Nikkei, Pichai said Google is evaluating investments in a variety of energy technologies as it aims to achieve its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. The CEO provided no details as to where Alphabet might source nuclear power. However, announcements this year by other big tech firms support the idea that U.S.-based nuclear generators are poised to benefit from the opportunity. For instance, Amazon (AMZN) said in March that it would lean on nuclear generation to meet some of its power demand. Microsoft (MSFT) also reached an agreement in September with Vistra competitor Constellation Energy (CEG) to procure power from the currently shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Analysts have expressed optimism that Microsoft's deal with Constellation Energy could set a precedent for more agreements between big tech and nuclear generators. On Thursday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets increased their price target on Vistra stock to $141 from $105.

Title: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son Says A.I. Will Soon Be 10,000 Times Smarter Than Humans

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is flush with cash, thanks to the likes of Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank (SFTBF). The Japanese conglomerate chipped in $500 million during a recent funding round that valued the Sam Altman-led company at a staggering $157 billion. Announced yesterday (Oct. 2) and led by Thrive Capital, the $6.6 billion round also drew in A.I.-focused companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) and investment firms such as Tiger Global Management, ARK Invest and Altimeter Capital.

You can opt out anytime. Son didn’t directly address his investment while speaking today (Oct. 3) at the SoftBank World 2024 conference. But he praised OpenAI and the capabilities of the company’s recently released GPT-o1 A.I. models, codenamed “Strawberry,” describing them as having “developed the ability to think.” Son said he recently tested out the reasoning model by asking it a series of difficult questions, such as how to increase his savings account to 100 million Japanese yen ($681,000), and was impressed by its answers. Son, currently the second richest person in Japan, is estimated to be worth $31.4 billion. A.I. is on track to become even more powerful in the near future, Son said. His vision for A.I. includes personal agents that will be able to conduct a variety of everyday tasks, ranging from grocery shopping and making reservations to aiding in investments and monitoring the health of family members. “This technology will evolve to a point where your happiness will be its greatest reward,” said Son, adding that human happiness will be the “greatest reward” for personal agents. Such comments aren’t out of character for Son, who is known for his unrelenting optimism when it comes technological developments. This attitude has caused SoftBank’s Vision Funds to make ambitious tech bets that typically realize either major gains or losses. During the dot-com crash, for example, SoftBank lost some $170 billion on its internet investments. Son also infamously shed some $14 billion after backing the now-bankrupt WeWork. While Son spent the past few years laying low following a series of losses, he told investors last year that SoftBank was going on “offense mode” and was preparing to invest heavily in A.I., having amassed more than $35 billion since 2020. According to Son, A.I.’s developments will come fast and furious. Artificial general intelligence (A.G.I), a type of A.I. that matches the intelligence of humans, will come to fruition in the next two to three years, Son said at today’s event. And artificial superintelligence, (A.S.I.), which is 10,000 times more capable than humans, can be expected to be achieved in a decade, he claimed. Noting that the human brain consists of some 100 trillion synaptic connections, referring to points where neurons communicate with each other, Son said that “generative A.I.’s parameters—which are equivalent to these synapses—are growing at a furious pace.” (GPT-4 reportedly has about 1.7 trillion parameters.) To take advantage of the technology’s potential, the SoftBank CEO has ambitious plans to turn his conglomerate into an A.I. powerhouse. SoftBank’s A.I. strategy is currently anchored by Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer it acquired for $32 billion in 2016. Son has previously laid out his desire to eventually establish a variety of A.I.-focused divisions within SoftBank, complete with sectors dedicated to A.I. chips, data centers and even industrial robots. Besides SoftBank’s recent backing of OpenAI, the conglomerate in 2024 alone has also invested in Perplexity AI, an A.I.-powered search startup, and acquired Graphcore, a chipmaker and Nvidia rival.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) next-generation artificial intelligence chip is in full production, and demand for it is “insane,” according to CEO Jensen Huang. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said about the company’s highly anticipated AI platform, Blackwell, during a Wednesday evening appearance on CNBC. Shares of the chipmaker were up almost 3% during midday trading Thursday. Nvidia’s stock has climbed over 152% so far this year. When the company reported second-quarter earnings in August, Huang said that the company had shipped samples of Blackwell to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. In early August, the chipmaker saw its shares fall after a report that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws, possibly pushing deliveries back by at least three months. However, during its earnings call, Nvidia said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,” in the fourth quarter. The company added that demand for its Hopper chips remains strong and that it expects shipments to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. Huang said demand for Blackwell, which he previously said “is well above supply,” was making customers “emotional” and “tense,” during an interview at Goldman Sachs’s (GS) technology conference in September. “At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,” Huang said during his interview on CNBC (CMCSA). “We’re on a path to do that, and everything’s on track.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Over the Past 30 Years Might Surprise You
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/best-performing-s-and-p-500-stocks-8720206
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:01:59Z

When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks—those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings—these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed’s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like German healthcare company Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home décor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a "treasure hunt"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 2,100 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1981 in Louisiana and later incorporated in 1993, Pool has steadily grown into one of the world’s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions of several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen’s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care—but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2023, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iTunes Store in early 2001, followed by the iPod months later, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world’s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple’s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products—its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events—that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple’s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is "land light," contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through four key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; alcohol brands, which handles a selection of craft beers, hard seltzers, and flavored malt beverages (FMBs); and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics—focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture—helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola’s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2022, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world’s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon’s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world’s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon’s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2018, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company’s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company’s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia’s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company’s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of October 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), delivering impressive returns of 242%, 165%, and 143%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

Title: OpenAI will fall the hardest when the AI bubble bursts, analyst says
URL: https://qz.com/openai-multibillion-dollar-funding-chatgpt-ai-bubble-1851664344
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:01:00Z
Full Content:
OpenAI is now worth more than people were expecting. Wednesday, the artificial intelligence startup announced it had completed a $6.6 billion funding round, valuing it at $157 billion. The ChatGPT-maker’s raise is the largest private investment ever and puts OpenAI among the top three largest startups with venture backing, Bloomberg reported. Before the deal was finalized, OpenAI was expected to raise $6.5 billion in a round that would value it at $150 billion. “OpenAI needs follow-on funding to expand model training efforts and build proprietary products,” Brendan Burke, senior emerging technology analyst at PitchBook (MORN), said in a statement shared with Quartz. With the funding, OpenAI can keep up with its new competitor, xAI, which recently raised $6 billion, in building custom data centers, Burke said. He added that both multibillion-dollar raises show “the quantum of funding needed to remain competitive for frontier training efforts with the latest hardware.” However, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note after OpenAI’s raise that the startup “has capitalized on investors’ desperation to invest” in AI and set “very unusual terms that are yet another indication that AI remains in the midst of its 4th and largest bubble.” In OpenAI’s funding announcement, the company said ChatGPT has over 250 million users globally every week. The company said in September that it had reached one million paid business users, and an unnamed person told CNBC (CMCSA) the company has 11 million subscribers to ChatGPT Plus. In August, the startup’s monthly revenue reached $300 million — up 1,700% from the start of 2023, the New York Times (NYT) reported. OpenAI expects to end the year with $3.7 billion in annual sales, according to financial documents that reporters at the New York Times reviewed. The report also found that OpenAI expects $11.6 billion in revenue next year. According to PitchBook, the startup is “progressing toward $5 billion in annual recurring revenue,” mostly due to ChatGPT. Burke said OpenAI’s “revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believes the company can grow into.” But OpenAI’s revenue expectations will require its number of subscribers to grow by four times what it currently is, according to Windsor. “This is supposed to be achieved with no price erosion despite an increasingly bewildering number of competitors and Mark Zuckerberg’s contention that everyone is already ‘slashing prices’ to compete with Llama 3 priced at $0 per month,” Windsor said. In a note prior to the raise, Windsor said OpenAI “is no longer miles ahead of the competition,” and that with Meta’s (META) release of its flagship open-source Llama models, “the stage is set for rapid price erosion.” Another sign of a bubble, he said, is that free generative AI services are adding more features. “This is the pin that bursts the [AI] bubble in my opinion and given how much it has been inflated, there will be a significant correction to reality,” Windsor said. The startup also anticipates losing around $5 billion this year due to expenses such as running its AI models and paying employees, according to the New York Times’ review. But according to Windsor’s calculations, “ChatGPT+ should be hugely profitable by itself leading me to wonder where the rest of the money is going.” According to Windsor, the valuations of companies adjacent to generative AI, such as alternative energy startups and chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) — where Windsor said he sees most of the $6.6 billion raise likely going — “are far more reasonable and both will still perform well even if generative AI fails to live up to expectations.” Meanwhile, valuations of OpenAI and its competitors, who the startup has reportedly asked its investors not to back, “will only be able to defy gravity for so long” before a correction happens, Windsor said. According to Crunchbase, global venture funding for startups slowed in the third quarter of this year, but startups in the AI sector were at the top for investments. OpenAI’s new funding comes amid a spate of executive resignations and other governance issues, Windsor said, which means the startup will likely “fall the furthest and the hardest when the bubble eventually does burst.” OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the release of the company’s “reasoning” model, o1, and internal testing on frontier models “justifies continued investment in model development,” PitchBook also noted OpenAI’s executive departures, saying the company will likely evolve “with different executive leadership than that of the ChatGPT era.” According to PitchBook estimates, the generative AI software market is on track to double next year, exceeding $30 billion.

The Dow Jones dropped over 250 points on Thursday afternoon following the release of the latest jobless claims data, which showed a slight uptick. In addition to the labor data, persistent tensions in the Middle East and an ongoing port strike have fueled fears of inflationary pressures. According to data released by the Labor Department, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims rose to 225,000 for the week ending September 28, up from a revised figure of 219,000 the previous week. The increase slightly exceeded the expectations of economists, who had forecasted 222,000 claims. This report will be followed by the U.S. employment report on Friday, which includes key metrics such as the unemployment rate and changes in hourly wages, which will help gauge the overall health of the labor market. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 262 points, or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%. Oil prices continued to rise as West Texas Intermediate and Brent surged nearly 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively, in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly to 3.8%. Despite the decline across major indexes, AI stocks surged on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) were among the top-performing stocks. Meanwhile, healthcare stocks like Universal Health Services (UHS) and Humana (HUM) were among the weaker performers on Thursday.

Artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding at a $157 billion valuation—more than the market caps of companies like Uber Technologies (UBER) and Lowe's (LOW). The latest funding values the startup behind ChatGPT at nearly double the $86 billion it reportedly was valued at early this year. "The new funding will allow us to double down on our leadership in frontier AI research, increase compute capacity, and continue building tools that help people solve hard problems," the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company said. OpenAI didn't disclose the investors but according to The Wall Street Journal, venture capital firm Thrive Capital led the funding round, which also included Microsoft, AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank, and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management. Investors in the funding round will have the right to pull out their cash if OpenAI doesn't convert into a for-profit firm within two years, according to the Journal. The company reportedly told the investors it doesn't want them to invest in its largest private rivals, including Elon Musk's xAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. OpenAI didn't immediately return an Investopedia request for comment.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels After CEO Cites "Insane" Demand for AI Chips

Nvidia (NVDA) shares will remain in the spotlight Thursday after CEO Jensen Huang said during a CNBC interview late yesterday that demand for the company’s next generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips is “insane.” The AI darling also announced an expanded partnership with IT consulting firm Accenture (ACN). The chipmaker’s stock, which has gained 140% so far this year and helped fuel a broader rally in the S&P 500, continues to surpass Wall Street’s lofty expectations amid insatiable demand for its silicon as companies and governments invest heavily in AI infrastructure to power the technology. The stock was up 1.4% at $120.50 in premarket trading Thursday about two hours before the opening bell. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels to focus on. After topping out in late June, Nvidia shares have oscillated within a symmetrical triangle, a chart pattern that indicates a period of consolidation, typically followed by a new trending move in the direction of a breakout and longer-term trend, which in Nvidia’s case, signals further bullish price momentum. Indeed, If the stock moves above the triangle, with above-average trading volume confirming the breakout, investors can determine two potential upside price targets using the measuring principle and a bars pattern. To forecast a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For example, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target in the shares of $180. We can also use a bars pattern, which analyzes a prior trending move to predict a future directional move, assuming price patterns tend to rhyme. To use the technique on Nvidia’s chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from January to March and reposition it from this week’s low. Doing so forecasts an upside target of about $210, around 77% above Wednesday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier symmetrical triangle, offering investors insight how a trend higher from the current pattern may potentially play out. Despite the bullish technicals on Nvidia’s chart it’s also worth keeping a key breakdown area in mind given the stock’s history of significant price fluctuations. That level sits around $97, a region likely to attract support near a trendline linking the twin March peaks with the upward sloping 200-day moving average.
