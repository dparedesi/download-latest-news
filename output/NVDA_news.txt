Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting.

Title: End Of An Era: NVIDIA Replaces Intel In The Dow Jones Index

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel was one of only two tech stocks - the other being Microsoft - to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the dot-com bubble of the 90s. Chronic under performance, however, has consequences, and Intel is now being replaced with the poster child of the ongoing AI mania, NVIDIA, within the iconic index. $NVDA, $INTC [Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel] — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) November 1, 2024 To wit, we had noted about a month back that Intel was likely to get booted off the Dow Jones index as part of its upcoming rebalancing. Bear in mind that the DJIA rebalances quarterly, when stocks are added or removed systematically from the market cap-weighed index based on an extensive criteria. Now, that prognostication has panned out, with NVIDIA replacing Intel within the benchmark index. Of course, this development comes as Intel is showing nascent signs of stabilization. For the third quarter of 2024, Intel not only exceeded Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate but also provided a relatively upbeat guidance. However, the stock's initial euphoric reaction was tempered by the qualifier given by Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, within the ensuing earnings call, wherein he conceded that the uptake of the AI accelerator Gaudi 3 was "slower than expected" and, therefore, the chipmaker would miss its $500 Million initial target for AI Accelerators. Of course, as we reported recently, Amazon has now emerged as the anchor customer for Intel's chip fabrication ambitions. In the first phase of their planned collaboration, the chipmaker will leverage its "Intel 3" process to build a custom Xeon 6 chip for Amazon's data center workloads. In the second phase, the company will produce an "AI fabric chip" for Amazon's AWS on its 18A manufacturing process, which is compatible with TSMC's 2nm process and is expected to enter the commercial phase in 2025. Meanwhile, Intel is still waiting for the Biden Administration to start releasing the grants and loans that were promised under the CHIPS Act.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Intel will lose its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a 25-year run to Nvidia, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday, the latest blow to the struggling chipmaker that was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel’s shares (INTC) have declined 54% this year, making it the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. The stock fell about 1% in extended trading on Friday, while Nvidia (NVDA) was up 1.5%. Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company’s shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia’s graphics processors, the company is now the second-most valuable in the world and is seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company’s 10-for-one stock split in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders.

Title: Nvidia to replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) will be replaced by Nvidia (NVDA) on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index after a 25-year run, underscoring the shift in the chipmaking market and marking another setback for the struggling semiconductor firm. Nvidia will join the index next week along with paint-maker Sherwin-Williams , which will replace Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel's shares have declined 54% this year, making the company the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. Shares of Intel fell 1.6% in extended trading on Friday, while those of Nvidia were up 2.2%. This development comes a day after Intel expressed optimism about the future of its PC and server businesses, projecting current-quarter revenue above estimates but warning that it had "a lot of work to do." "Losing the status of Dow Jones inclusion would be another reputational blow for Intel, as it grapples with a painful transformation and loss of confidence," said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. "It would also mean that Intel is not included in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which track the index, which could impact the share price further." Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, "Intel Inside" stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Intel's revenue was $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from 2021, when Pat Gelsinger took over as CEO. Analysts expect Intel to report its first annual net loss this year since 1986. The company is worth less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. That pales in comparison to Nvidia, which is sitting at a $3.32 trillion valuation, making it the world's second-most valuable company. NVIDIA'S AI LEAD Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company's shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia's graphics processors, it is now seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company's 10-for-one stock split that took effect in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders. Intel, on the other hand, has struggled to gain share in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia, with the front-runner's chips hard to get and even harder to replace in AI datacenters, owing to the processors' technological edge and the high costs of replacing them.

Title: Amazon is still figuring out Alexa's AI brain

A decade after making waves with its voice assistant, Alexa, Amazon (AMZN-1.07%) seems to be struggling to bring it into the generative artificial intelligence era. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said the company is continuing “to rearchitect the brain” of its voice assistant with a set of next-generation foundation models — or larger models trained on broad, generalized data sets. “When we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world’s best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea,” David Fildes, Amazon vice president of investor relations, said. “And I think if you look at what’s happened in generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you’re kind of missing the boat if you don’t believe that’s going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen.” By rearchitecting Alexa with its foundation models, Fildes said Amazon believes it has “an opportunity to be the leader” in the next generation of voice assistants and generative AI applications. The next generation, he said, will not only be better at answering questions and summarizing data, “but also taking actions.” Jassy said Amazon would share the new models with customers soon, and that the company is “increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices,” including the Kindle. Amazon declined to share more specifics on its release plans in an email to Quartz. Alexa AI’s postponed release is due to technical challenges, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. One person told the publication that Amazon’s Alexa AI teams were recently told their target deadline is now in 2025. In June, Fortune reported that the AI-powered Alexa — which Amazon demoed last September and said would be available for a free preview on its Alexa-fitted devices in the U.S. — is not even close to being ready. Former employees told the publication that the company doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its voice assistant. The company also reportedly deprioritized Alexa AI to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon said its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.55%) graphics processing units (GPUs). “We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices,” an Amazon spokesperson previously told Quartz in a statement. “We are excited about what we’re building and look forward to delivering it for our customers.” On Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call, Jassy said Amazon has a “very deep partnership with Nvidia” and plans to “be their lead partner on most of their new chips.” Production of the second version of Amazon’s training chips, Trainium, will start ramping up in the next few weeks, Jassy said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped, set for a comeback on Friday as investors digested a big miss in the monthly jobs report, and welcomed Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8%, both coming off a steep selloff fueled by worries about Big Tech's AI spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added roughly 0.8%. Markets took in their stride the disappointing headline numbers in the all-important jobs report. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, significantly missing expectations. The government said those numbers were weighed down by recent hurricanes and strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA). The report is the last major economic data before the Federal Reserve's next policy decision on Nov. 7. Market expectations for that meeting moved little in its wake, with traders pricing in about 98% odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed meeting next week, per CME FedWatch. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Meanwhile, upbeat earnings from Amazon helped dissipate the gloom around Big Tech's prospects that drove Thursday's slump in stocks. Its shares jumped over 6% in morning trading after CEO Andy Jassy said its cloud unit's AI business was seeing triple-digit revenue growth. Morale also got a lift from Intel's (INTC) earnings beat and outlook, which revived hopes for the chipmaker's turnaround and boosted the stock. But Apple (AAPL) shares slipped as its results and outlook left Wall Street wanting more. Elsewhere in corporates, Boeing shares tipped higher after the union backed its latest offer to end a significant factory workers' strike. The sweetened deal would lift wages by 38%. Meanwhile, oil prices rose over 2% amid revived Mideast fears, after a report that Iran is planning a strike on Israel via militias that it backs in Iraq. Brent (BZ=F) crude futures traded at around $74 a barrel after briefly nudging $75, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures were not far off the $71 level. Wall Street positioned itself for a turnaround Friday after a strong showing from Amazon (AMZN) lifted investor sentiment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped 0.5% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, both coming off steep losses fueled by after-earnings tumbles in Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.4%. But impressive reports from Amazon and Intel (INTC) set stocks on a comeback trajectory. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend "more than that" in 2025, showing investors that heavy AI spending can coincide with profit growth. Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) stocks jumped Friday, lifting Nvidia (NVDA) shares with them. Amazon stock jumped as much as 7% premarket as the company proved it can balance hefty AI spending with profit growth. The company’s profit jumped more than 50% to over $17 billion in the third quarter, and its 11% operating margin came in above Wall Street’s expectations of just over 9%. At the same time, CEO Andy Jassy said the company will likely rack up $75 billion in expenses for the full year and spend even more next year. That’s good news for Nvidia, which rose 1.5% premarket. The AI chipmakers’ shares had fallen a day earlier amid fears of moderating AI spending from Big Tech firms. The stock was also helped by positive sentiment on Intel, which itself jumped 7.6% premarket after giving an upbeat fourth quarter outlook. Intel’s guidance lifted chip stocks across the board after a rough few days. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) fell roughly 2% on weaker-than-expected China sales, a hefty EU tax payment and a soft sales outlook for the current period. Apple projected sales will rise in the low-to-mid single digits in the December quarter, lower than the 7% expected by analysts. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, fewer than the 100,000 economists expected. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. Recent strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA), and weather-related disruptions weighed on the labor market last month, the government said.

Title: Mizuho: NVIDIA Might Miss Its Guidance If Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Fails To Find Operational Funding

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is in a veritable maelstrom at the moment, battling allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, an audit-related nightmare where the firm has lost its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. Now, a Mizuho analyst is arguing that NVIDIA might not be able to emerge from this saga unscathed, especially as Super Micro Computer constitutes its third-largest customer. Mizuho on $SMCI $NVDA $DELL Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) October 31, 2024 To wit, Mizuho believes that, as an enterprise with a negative working capital paradigm that necessitates extensive external funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid-cooled products "to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems," Super Micro Computer might not be able to tap the requisite external liquidity in the coming days, owing to a growing host of risk factors. Should SMCI face a funding deficit, it will have a direct bearing on NVIDIA, which is "now at risk of missing guidance," as per Mizuho's assessment. The analyst goes on to note: "My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL." Meanwhile, as noted above, Super Micro Computer's travails are only getting more entrenched. First, Hindenburg Research leveled hard-hitting allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, asserting that the server provider engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. BREAKING: Super Micro Computer was warned if it fails to provide an audited compliance plan by Nov 16, it will be delisted from the Nasdaq. This news comes 1 day after auditor Ernst & Young resigned. $SMCI is $NVDA's 3rd largest customer & heavy user of $NVDA's vendor financing. https://t.co/SQKE9Oc3zB pic.twitter.com/cBSEFfFVQi — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 31, 2024 In the aftermath, Super Micro Computer delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, 2024, presumably in a bid to undertake a comprehensive internal review. Under the prevailing statutory requirements, that report had to be filed by the 30th of August. What's more, SMCI's continuing dilatory tactics have now attracted the wrath of the Nasdaq exchange, which has warned of a potential de-listing action should the firm fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. What's more, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. Elsewhere, as we recently reported, Ernst & Young (EY) sent a letter to Super Micro Computer's audit committee earlier this week, tendering its resignation as the company's officially designated accounting firm: “We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.” Bear in mind that, with EY's resignation, Super Micro Computer has lost its second auditor in around 18 months. $SMCI said it "disagreed" with the accounting firm's decision and does not expect the "resolution of any matters raised by EY" to result in the restatement of its quarterly reports for fiscal 2024 or prior fiscal years. — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) October 30, 2024 Interestingly, throughout this saga, SMCI has continued to profess innocence and has maintained that its annual report for the fiscal year 2024 will not undergo "any material changes." Over the past five trading days, Super Micro Computer shares have recorded a whopping loss of 37 percent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In jobs-related data, initial jobless claims declined to a five-month low of 216,000, lower than estimates. Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a fifth straight week as pre-election volatility continued to rock the bond market. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.72% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, up from 6.54% a week earlier. 15-year mortgage rates also increased to 5.99% from 5.71% a week ago. Read more here. Technology stocks led the overall market declines on Thursday. The S&P 500 Technology Sector (XLK) ETF slid 2.8% by mid-session. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning. Read more here. Stocks accelerated their losses on Thursday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped as much as 2% with technology sliding. Among the biggest laggards, Nvidia (NVDA) sank 4% while Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO) also fell 4%. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Stellantis (STLA) reported third quarter revenue and shipments that missed estimates, though the company said it's making "progress addressing operational issues." The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock. Economic data: Core PCE index, (September); Initial & Continuing jobless claims, (week ending Oct. 26); Employment cost index, (third quarter); Challenger jobs cuts, (October); Personal income & Spending, (September) Earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Conoco Phillips (COP), Estée Lauder (EL), Kellanova (K), Intel (INTC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines(NCLH), Peloton (PTON), Merck (MRK), SiriusXM (SIRI), Comcast (CMCSA); Uber (UBER) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Microsoft stock slides as investors weigh earnings Meta beats, but stock falls on heavy spending plans Peloton names former Apple exec as CEO to steer turnaround 'Shadow campaigns': Microsoft-Google legal feud heats up Merck beats Q3 expectations, but China Gardasil sales lag Tesla chipmaker STMicro trims revenue outlook for 3rd time Gold climbs to record amid US election jitters Starbucks (SBUX) shares are indicating a slightly higher open today despite more details about the dreadful quarter the company preannounced last week. And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on fears of AI spending slowdown

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are getting dragged down by Microsoft and Meta
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-smci-amd-mu-avgo-ai-stocks-down-microsoft-and-me-1851686429

Despite posting robust quarterly profits, Microsoft (MSFT-0.44%) and Meta (META-1.13%) shares slumped Thursday as both tech giants signaled substantial future AI spending requirements and slower growth prospects. The companies that have emerged as leaders in the AI sector saw their stocks decline despite heavy investments in generative AI that had previously fueled investor optimism. The downward pressure rippled through the broader AI ecosystem, dragging down shares of key semiconductor and hardware providers. Nvidia (NVDA+0.55%) fell 4.5%, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-0.84%) dropped 2.8%, Micron Technology (MU+2.06%) slid 4.4%, and Broadcom (AVGO-0.21%) was down 4.8%. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.12%) faced an even steeper decline, plummeting 15% amid an ongoing dispute with its auditor. The AI hardware company is now at risk of potential delisting from the Nasdaq, adding further uncertainty for investors. In Microsoft’s (MSFT-0.44%) third-quarter earnings report Wednesday evening, it acknowledged that it can’t build data centers fast enough to meet the AI demand. Microsoft’s “inability to build data centres fast enough has constrained its guidance for the coming quarter,” Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. During a post-earnings call with analysts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company has run into external constraints due to high demand for artificial intelligence training and inferencing. “[Data centers] don’t get built overnight,” Nadella said. “Even in Q2 for example, some of the demand issues we have, or rather our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. That’s the constraints we have.” The tech giant’s shares were down over 5% during trading on Thursday, trading at $409 per share. The stock is approaching its worst performance in months, having dropped nearly 2% over the past three months. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META-1.13%) has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence as it looks to keep pace with its Magnificent 7 competitors. The tech giant warned that this spending will only grow into next year and beyond. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg gave analysts a hint of what some of those investments could look like on a call Wednesday but said the company would offer more details once it finalizes its budget in the fourth quarter. “First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Zuckerberg said. “So, I think we should invest more there.” “And second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too,” he added. The shares of Meta were down 3.75% on Thursday afternoon. – Britney Nguyen and Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AI darling Super Micro Computer could get booted off the Nasdaq as the stock plunges another 15%

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.12%) fell an additional 15% on Thursday, trading at $28 per share, following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young. Although the server company joined the S&P 500 in March 2024, this year hasn’t been smooth, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. Meanwhile, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh has maintained a neutral rating and a $45 stock price target amid concerns over the company’s internal financial controls. The company faced a recent setback when its accountant, Ernst & Young, decided to resign after months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. The conflicts between Ernst & Young and Super Micro Computer began in late July, as the auditor raised concerns regarding the company’s internal financial controls, governance, and transparency. In response, Super Micro formed a special board committee to investigate the issues. But Ernst & Young ultimately concluded it could no longer stand behind the company’s financial statements. In its resignation letter, EY said it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,” citing recent information that allegedly made it impossible to rely on representations from Super Micro’s executives and audit committee. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.55%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course. Despite the recent sharp downturn, the firm’s current price remains nearly 13% higher than it was a year ago. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Buy Dell stock on SMCI's auditor woes - analyst

Investing.com --- AI server maker Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) plunged 33% on Wednesday and is down another 12% today after the company disclosed that its registered public accountant Ernst & Young LLP resigned amid an audit of the company fiscal year results. Amid the chaos at SMCI, analysts say another AI server maker stands to benefit – Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL). Dell rose 6% on Wednesday, but Mizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein thinks there is more upside and is now bullish on the stock. “If you are not paying attention to the mess that is SMCI, you should,” Klein said. As a result, the analyst sees material upside for Dell over the next two to three quarters and would remain a buyer on any weakness. “My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL,” the analyst added. Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling product to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems. “NVDA will probably start to move the majority of their GPU supply away from SMCI until they get clarity on the situation,” the analyst states. He said this benefits Dell. With SMCI potentially hamstrung, this “removes a price aggressor on Gen AI server rates systems," according to the analyst. “Dell walked away from large tier one cloud supply agreements over weak margins (they preferred not to lose money on the revenues),” the analyst said. “Their focused on profitable tier 2 cloud customers. But maybe they can go back and WIN TIER 1 CLOUD SERVER DEALS WITH MORE GPU SUPPLY AND LESS PRICING PRESSURE FROM SMCI.” Dell stock is down 3% in early trading Thursday.
