Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: The mystery of Nvidia’s underperforming stock

Nvidia may be the biggest name in the artificial-intelligence boom, but the stock has lagged behind peers over the past few months. “Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, it’s hard to find a stronger performer than Nvidia," Bespoke Investment Group wrote on Wednesday. The market research group noted that Nvidia shares were up 982% from that date through their record close on Aug. 12. However, Nvidia’s footing has looked increasingly shaky, especially relative to other AI-linked stocks. A basket of stocks including foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, data-storage company Seagate Technology, and memory-chip maker Micron has gained 68.2% since Oct. 31, 2024; Nvidia has gained just 28.3% since then. The underperformance is evident even when comparing Nvidia to other stocks, not just chip makers. Bespoke’s “Picks & Shovels" basket, which includes energy and data-center infrastructure stocks like Constellation Energy, Vistra, NRG Energy, and Quanta Services has gained nearly 61% since Oct. 31—more than twice as much as Nvidia. The latest leg of the performance gap was kicked off by earnings from Oracle earlier this month, Bespoke noted. It revealed a significant increase in Oracle’s backlog for contracted work. “We don’t have a strong thesis as to why NVDA has been such a relative underperformer over the past month," the research group admitted. Investor expectations were high, but Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report was far from a bust. Adjusted earnings, revenue, and third-quarter revenue guidance all came in above expectations. One might think the company’s troubles in China are spooking investors. Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed last month to give the Trump administration a 15% cut of their AI-chip sales in the country. Then, on Wednesday, a report suggested Chinese companies had been banned from purchasing Nvidia’s semiconductors. But the stock actually inched up following confirmation from the White House in August. And even though shares tumbled on Wednesday, closing down 2.6%, they bounced back on Thursday. Even if Chinese sales are challenged, “other buyers appear to be as desperate as ever to get their hands on NVDA GPUs," Bespoke added. The market for GPUs, however, may not be as strong as it once was. Bespoke notes that the cost to rent GPU’s has been declining, and a look at the Silicon Data H100 Rental Index, which tracks the hourly cost of renting a graphics processing unit, suggests that is accurate. The index climbed to $2.89 an hour in mid-April, but was down to $2.41 one month later, before slipping to $2.15 on Thursday. “Part of that is thanks to the introduction of their Blackwell line, which is generally more efficient, but it remains the case that data centers are chasing falling prices for a given level of capacity," Bespoke added. It’s difficult to predict where Nvidia will go next—and the stock isn’t falling, just lagging. In fact, the concerns may be much ado about nothing. But the market has a way of sniffing out problems before investors do, creating something of a quandry. “It wouldn’t be the first time that a secular winner faces a narrative test before continuing to surge if that ends up playing out," Bespoke wrote. “But we are somewhat surprised at how little attention the underperformance of the largest listed U.S. stock is getting, especially relative to other adjacent names." And now investors have to make sense of Nvidia’s partnership with Intel to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers, an announcement that sent shares up 3.5% on Thursday. It’s almost enough to make one give up on AI altogether. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Is a deal with AI darling Nvidia enough to win investors over to Intel's stock? A $5 billion investment and a promise to co-develop chips for data centers and PCs from the chip designer at the heart of the AI boom sent Intel (INTC) shares soaring 23% to around $31 Thursday. That brought the stock to levels not seen since July 2024, before a wider-than-expected loss and massive restructuring plan announced that August dealt a blow to investor confidence and sent its stock reeling. Roughly a year later, the struggling chipmaker has welcomed a new CEO, laid off workers, and struck a deal with President Donald Trump to sell the government a 10% stake. That inspired enough confidence to bring the stock up 24% this year heading into Thursday's session. Intel was for years a blue-chip stock and a member of the Dow industrials. It's fallen on hard times recently, with the stock at half its 2021 highs. Thursday's vote of confidence from Nvidia, which replaced it in the Dow, could be seen as a turning point not only for the stock but for a company that has struggled to engineer a turnaround. Today's Nvidia-fueled (NVDA) momentum has Intel's year-to-day gains above 50%. Some analysts now think the momentum could mark a turning point in sentiment for the stock, which Wall Street has largely viewed with caution and currently sits at around half of its 2021 highs. All 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha held "hold" ratings for Intel's stock up until Thursday. The Nvidia news is "a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game," Wedbush's Dan Ives told clients in a note Thursday. Wedbush said it expects the move, which could lend Intel some of Nvidia's AI-driven tailwinds, to help stem further losses of Intel's existing market share in server and PC products and boost the company's longer-term prospects. "The chip landscape remains [Nvidia's] world with everybody else paying rent," Ives said. Bernstein analysts led by Stacy Rasgon called the blessing from Nvidia "priceless." Some analysts said Intel may need further support. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead called it a “step in the right direction” in an interview with CNBC Thursday, though he suggested Intel likely requires another $5 billion to $10 billion to build out its chip manufacturing capabilities. However, Moorhead said, there’s now a “pretty long line of people” the chipmaker could turn to in exchange for some concessions. "The question becomes control, ownership, and voting rights," he said.

September 18, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally. Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups. “This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.” The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups. “NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.” NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone. Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators. “In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.” “We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.” “We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.” “The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.” “Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.” About NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest public company by market cap, said it will invest $5 billion in Intel (INTC) and work with the chipmaker on developing custom data-center and PC products as artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive. AI crypto tokens rose on the news. The Santa Clara, California-based maker of the graphic processing units (GPUs) that underpin AI computing will buy shares of its neighbor at $23.28 each, 6.5% lower than Wednesday's closing price of $24.90, according to an announcement on Thursday. NEAR, the largest AI crypto token by market cap, climbed to over $2.95, its highest in a month, gaining more than 10% in 24 hours. TAO advanced 5.75% and FET 6.75%, outperforming the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index added 3.41%. While Nvidia is known for its GPU production, Intel was a leader in developing microprocessors and entered public consciousness as the provider of central processing units (CPUs) that drove IBM-compatible microcomputers. Its fortunes have declined as AI, with its intensive computing requirements, has taken root. Intel stock surged 24% on Thursday, taking its market cap to $143 billion. That's just a fraction of the $500 billion it boasted in 2000, according to companiesmarketcap.com. Nvidia, with a value of $4.23 trillion, rose 1.85%. The U.S. government bought a 10% stake in Intel last month for $8.9 billion in an attempt to shore up the future of American chip manufacturing. The crypto industry watches Nvidia's performance with a keen eye as a proxy for market sentiment, which may reflect in AI tokens and the broader crypto market.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia said on Thursday that it would buy $5 billion worth of Intel’s common stock, becoming another major shareholder in the beleaguered company just weeks after the US government took a roughly 10% stake. The tech giant, which makes artificial intelligence chips, will pay $23.28 per share, it said in a joint press release. The purchase will give Nvidia around 4% or more of Intel after new shares are issued to complete the deal, Reuters reported. Intel shares (INTC) surged 22.77% on Thursday and posted their biggest single-day gain since 1987. Nvidia shares (NVDA), meanwhile, gained 3.49%. Last month, US President Donald Trump and Intel announced that the government was making an $8.9 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, with Trump calling it “a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.” “This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. The investment is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and cement America’s position as a leader in the global chipmaking industry. Trump has said that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, excluding suppliers that have committed to building products in the United States. Although Intel was once one of America’s most important tech companies, it has fallen behind rivals after failing to anticipate successive technology waves. Lip-Bu Tan, who took over as CEO in March, has been attempting to turn the company around. The two tech companies also announced that they would jointly develop custom data center and personal computing products. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the overall agreement was “a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game.” “Today’s announcement further strengthens the US lead in the AI arms race against China as Intel now goes from a laggard to a catalyst,” they wrote in a note.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are sharply higher after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year; Intel (INTC) shares are soaring on news that AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker; Meta Platforms (META) revealed its AI-powered glasses; and StubHub (STUB) stock is pointing lower after shares in the ticket reseller fell in their first trading session. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings. Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%. Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading. Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday.
