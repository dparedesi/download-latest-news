We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks. In an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop. He also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market. Regarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform. Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data. Lee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction. Regarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins. While some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s GPUs are widely utilized in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. Notable customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is positioned for ongoing growth, driven by its strong presence in the data center market and the upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is highly sought after by companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, who are building AI data centers to support their products. The Blackwell GPUs, priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, are already being distributed to data centers and industrial customers for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025. In a CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that "Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane," adding, "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first." NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in accelerated computing and generative AI is also a key factor in its growth outlook. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas. In Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024. With its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company’s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Investors seeking sustainable returns will need to look for companies with solid long-term growth potential. To this end, top Wall Street analysts, with their expertise, can help investors understand the key drivers that could support a company's long-term growth and pick stocks that are likely to deliver lucrative returns. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is cybersecurity company Fortinet (FTNT). The company aims to become a leader in the secure access service edge space. Fortinet leverages machine learning and AI technologies to offer cybersecurity solutions. Recently, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reaffirmed a buy rating on Fortinet stock and raised the price target to $90 from $75. The analyst stated that channel checks and discussions with industry participants indicate continued recovery in FTNT's business and healthy demand across the company's broad product portfolio. In fact, channel checks suggest that Fortinet's third-quarter revenue and billings will reach the top end of the company's outlook, with the possibility of a modest upside. Also, the analyst is confident about his Q4 revenue growth estimate of 12%, given "healthy closure rates and further pipeline building into a seasonally strong 4Q24." Eyal also noted that one of the key drivers supporting Fortinet's ongoing recovery is the solid traction in the company's operational technology products, backed by a long-term replacement cycle that will replace legacy OT systems. The analyst added that FTNT is also gaining from the adoption of AI-led networks and the company's growing focus on cloud security, which was bolstered by the recent acquisition of Lacework. Eyal ranks No. 12 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. (See Fortinet Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks) We move on to GitLab (GTLB), an AI-powered, cloud-based software company that helps organizations enhance developer productivity, improve operational efficiency, and reduce security and compliance risks. Following meetings with the company's management, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated a buy rating on GitLab stock with a price target of $62. The analyst noted that management is highly confident about capturing further opportunities in the $40 billion total addressable market. Currently, the two vendors, GitLab and Microsoft's GitHub, together account for just about 5% of the market share in the software development life cycle space. In particular, management expects the momentum for GitLab's Duo Pro product to pick up in 2025, fueled by the generative AI wave. The analyst also highlighted the company's optimism about the GitLab Dedicated offering, which is witnessing better-than-anticipated customer interest and driving higher average revenue per unit. Overall, Moskowitz remains "constructive on GTLB's ability to execute and grow at a high level over the medium-to-longer term, due in large part to multiple upside levers that include seat expansion, price increases, and upsell potential." Moskowitz ranks No. 321 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. (See GitLab's Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) Finally, let's look at semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA). The company has been seeing stellar revenue growth rates, driven by robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) in building artificial intelligence models and applications. Following an investor meeting with Nvidia's management, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock and raised the price target to $150 from $135. The analyst's optimism after the meeting reflects a "better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand." Hari noted Nvidia's confidence about the demand backdrop, given continued spending on accelerated computing and GPUs by data center operators amid the generative AI wave. Management also highlighted the prospects for its Blackwell platform. The analyst thinks that Blackwell's launch and ramp-up are not just near- and medium-term revenue growth drivers, but also key factors that will enhance Nvidia's competitive advantage. Hari increased his revenue estimates for fiscal 2025-2027 to reflect recent industry developments like increased cloud spending, solid order trends at the major AI server original equipment manufacturers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and an improved chip-on-wafer-on-substrate shipment outlook. Hari ranks No. 32 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%.

Title: Details Better Than The Headline This Earnings Season
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/20/details-better-than-the-headline-this-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
The blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter, but 79% ... [+] of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings this season. Within the S&P 500, 42 companies reported earnings last week. 79% of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The third-quarter earnings season enters its second busiest reporting week, with 112 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Among the companies scheduled include Coca-Cola (KO), Tesla (TSLA), Union Pacific (UNP), 3M (MMM), and Honeywell (HON). A more detailed preview of the earnings season is available here. S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose by 0.9% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a gain of 0.7%. Interestingly, despite the S&P 500 setting a new all-time closing high on Friday, the Magnificent 7 remains about 5% below its July high. However, the Magnificent 7 still dominates the year-to-date performance. Stock Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical outperformed, the less economically exposed defensive stocks. The spike in cyclical outperformance followed the much better-than-expected monthly jobs report, which removed the short-term fear of recession. The outperformance of smaller-capitalization stocks is another sign that markets are becoming less concerned about the risk of recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The financials sector was the most significant contributor to earnings growth, led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Progressive (PGR), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS), according to FactSet. Conversely, the energy, healthcare, and industrials sectors have been the most significant detractors of S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings estimates for energy companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), were cut, sending the energy sector estimates to -26.0% year-over-year after expecting a -19.1% at the start of the earnings season. Boeing (BA) announced much worse than expected preliminary results last week, which caused analysts to slash earnings estimates, sending the industrials sector estimates to -8.4% year-over-year versus 1.3% growth at the start of the earnings season. Boeing is scheduled to make its official earnings report on Wednesday. Healthcare sector earnings, expected to be a bright spot this quarter, have fallen to an expected 5.7% growth rate compared to 11.2% year-over-year at the end of the quarter. The primary culprit was Eli Lilly (LLY), which saw earnings estimates revised lower after an announcement that acquisition-related charges for in-process research and development (IPR&D) would lower profits by approximately $2.83 billion or $3.08 per share. 3Q 2024 Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth likely solid year-over-year for the first quarter, topline revenue growth for companies should have a tailwind. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has matched expectations. 3Q 2024 Sales Growth By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +3.4% year-over-year, below the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Based on the better-than-expected consumer spending data last week, the Atlanta Fed estimates 3.4% 3Q GDP growth. The hurricanes and the threatened dock worker strike complicate the analysis of economic data since the more robust retail sales could have been driven by pulling forward demand, which will then be a headwind for upcoming consumer spending data. In any case, the economy remains resilient; it is just a matter of how strong the normalized growth is. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate The additional rate cuts expected in 2024 are two successive 25 basis point (0.25%) cuts in November and December. While the probability, based on the pricing of Fed Fund futures, remains high, they have fallen from even higher conviction levels as recent economic data has been robust. Federal Reserve Expected Rate Cuts The heart of earnings season kicks off this week with the laggard of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), reporting earnings. Even though the current estimated third-quarter earnings growth doesn’t reflect it yet, almost eighty percent of companies have outperformed earnings forecasts. Forward guidance remains critical, with less fear of an economic downturn and consensus estimates calling for double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and 2025.

Title: SCHD: Split or Not, This Is a Strong Dividend ETF
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schd-split-not-strong-dividend-181846209.html

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market today with a massive $63.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund recently made some waves by executing a 3-for-1 split which went into effect on October 10th. We’ll discuss the rationale and details regarding the share split in this article. But more importantly, we’ll evaluate the merits of holding SCHD in an investment portfolio. I’m bullish on this well-known dividend ETF based on the strength of its attractive yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated dividend stocks, and an ultra-low expense ratio. According to fund sponsor Charles Schwab, SCHD’s strategy is simply to invest in an index called the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index is “focused on the quality and sustainability of dividends.” The fund also “invests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.” As one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market, SCHD recently made some waves when it conducted a 3-for-1 stock split that went effective on October 10, 2024. It’s much more common for company stocks to split than ETFs, and here is a rare case where an exchange-traded fund has split. The split doesn’t have any fundamental impact on SCHD’s investment prospects. What’s occurred is that investors now own three shares of SCHD for every one share previously held, while the market price of the ETF is 1/3 the value it would be without the split. A share split has some minor benefits, such as the lower price per share making it easier for smaller investors to establish an investment. A stock split can also enhance liquidity. It may also trigger increased options activity on the ticker (an options contract consists of 100 shares). But with all that said, the outlook for SCHD stock should be no different now than if no split had taken place. Many popular stocks that have engaged in stock splits over the past year, like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), had share prices of well over $1,000 a share, making a split more meaningful. Those splits made it significantly more affordable for investors to buy a share, or one lot (100) of shares. SCHD, on the other hand, was trading at just under $85 per share before the split, so the need for a split seemed less apparent here. The ability to buy fractional shares on brokerages like Robinhood (HOOD) and others also mitigates the need for stock splits to some degree. Regardless, at the end of the day, this is the same solid dividend ETF with the same holdings it had prior to the share split. The SCHD ETF offers sound diversification to investors. It owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 41.0% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of SCHD’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool. As you can see, the fund owns a plethora of well-known dividend stocks, ranging from top holding Home Depot (HD), to BlackRock (BLK), to Lockheed Martin (LMT). In addition to being blue-chip dividend stocks, another thing that these top holdings have in common is that they offer strong Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human interpretation. Impressively, eight stocks from SCHD’s top 10 holdings have Smart Scores of eight or better. The Smart Score system also rates SCHD itself favorably, giving it an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8. Beyond being top dividend stocks, another nice thing about SCHD’s holdings is that overall, they are fairly inexpensive. The ETF’s holdings currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6x. This is another reason I’m bullish on the ETF. While a 17.6x P/E ratio isn’t dirt cheap, it’s considerably more affordable than the broader market at a time when the S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7x. This means that SCHD and its holdings probably offer a bit more downside protection than the broader market, and potentially have a bit more room for upside from multiple expansion. The fund also carries a beta of 0.74. This means that SCHD’s share price is only about three-quarters as volatile as the broader market. This adds credence to SCHD’s defensive qualities (as discussed above in the valuation section) which can be attractive for investors seeking to avoid volatility. SCHD has generated solid returns for its shareholders over the years. As of September 30th, the ETF has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.2%, a five-year annualized return of 13.0%, and a 10-year annualized return of 11.7%. It’s worth noting that SCHD has lagged behind broad market funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) over each of these time frames (for reference, VOO has posted an annualized five-year return of 15.9%). That is likely attributable to the growth opportunities many non-dividend paying companies have available. SCHD’s underperformance against the S&P 500 index (SPX), and its tracking ETFs, comes at a time when many large-cap tech stocks with small (or no) dividends have powered the index. If we return to an environment where more value-oriented dividend stocks are favored again, SCHD could outperform the broad market. For example, SCHD has slightly outperformed VOO over the past three months in what has been a volatile time for tech stocks. Regardless of comparisons, double-digit returns over a 10-year time horizon, like SCHD has delivered, are nothing to scoff at. Furthermore, for investors who own a large number of high-flying tech stocks, SCHD could provide worthwhile diversification benefits. The SCHD ETF currently yields 3.4%. This is an attractive yield and more than double the current yield of the S&P 500. That’s pretty attractive. Furthermore, the fund has a track record of dividend consistency. SCHD has paid a dividend for 12 straight years, and increased its payout annually. The dividend payout has been growing at a solid 12% clip over the past five years, so investors can likely expect continued increases in payouts over time. Unless, of course, hard times hit Corporate America, forcing some companies to cut their dividend. SCHD charges a bargain-bin expense ratio of just 0.06%. This means that an investor with $10,000 in the fund will pay just $6 in fees over the course of a year. It’s hard to argue with this expense ratio; it’s less than the price of a fast-food lunch these days. The savings from a low-fee investment fund like SCHD can really add up over time. Assuming that the current expense ratio remains the same, and the fund returns 5% per year on an annualized basis going forward, an investor putting $10,000 into SCHD would pay just $77 in fees over the course of a decade. Turning to Wall Street, SCHD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 54 Buys, 37 Holds, and 10 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SCHD stock price target of $30.16 implies about 5% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on SCHD based on its attractive 3.4% dividend yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated blue-chip dividend stocks, the relatively inexpensive valuation of these holdings, and the fund’s investor-friendly expense ratio. The recent 3-for-1 split was an interesting development but ultimately doesn’t change much for the ETF or its holders. The one downside of SCHD is that it has lagged the broader market over the years, despite posting respectable double-digit annualized returns. As noted above, some of SCHD’s underperformance versus the S&P 500 is due to the dominant performance of large-cap tech stocks, companies that don’t generally pay attractive dividends. SCHD stock could be serve a valuable purpose in an investor’s portfolio, by delivering strong dividend income and lower volatility. SCHD could also outperform should investors rotate away from growth and back toward value-oriented dividend stocks. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. French AI startup Mistral announced two state-of-the-art edge models this week. Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B, dubbed les Ministraux, are for “on-device computing and at-the-edge use cases,” or devices such as smartphones and laptops. The models were developed “to provide a compute-efficient and low-latency solution” to companies working on applications such as “on-device translation, internet-less smart assistants,” and autonomous robots, Mistral said. Lightmatter, a startup that builds photonic tech for chips used in data centers, announced a $400 million Series D funding round this week that values the company at $4.4 billion. The round, which brings Lightmatter’s total capital raised to $850 million, was led by T. Rowe Price Associates. With the funding, Lightmatter said it plans to deploy its Passage technology to data center partners, “enabling the scaling required for sustained AI innovation.” “We’re not just advancing AI infrastructure — we’re reinventing it,” Lightmatter co-founder and chief executive Nick Harris said in a statement. “With Passage, the world’s fastest photonic engine, we’re setting a new standard for performance and breaking through the barriers that limit AI computing. This funding accelerates our ability to scale, delivering the supercomputers of tomorrow today.” Soniox, a startup focused on voice AI, debuted its multimodal AI model, Omnio, which the company claims can “understand” audio and text inputs. Omnio “excels at identifying speakers, their roles, and even the nuances of their interactions, including emotions, sentiment, and speaking styles,” Soniox said. The startup says its model is “on par” with OpenAI’s GPT-4o and other language models on benchmarks for text. The company was co-founded by Ambroz Bizjak and Klemen Simonic, formerly of Meta. Xscape Photonics, a startup using silicon photonics in data centers, announced a $44 million Series A funding round this week, which included investors such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Cisco (CSCO). The startup plans to use the funding to accelerate development of its ChromX platform, which is used for AI data center fabrics. “Historically, performance and scalability challenges have been addressed by building bigger data centers to train large language models,” Vivek Raghunathan, co-founder and chief executive of Xscape Photonics, said in a statement, adding that the process is unsustainable and leads to issues with cost and energy consumption. “At Xscape Photonics, we are on a mission to help our customers completely reimagine how they solve these challenges,” Raghunathan said. “This funding validates our mission and positions us for future growth to support next-generation AI data centers.” Boston Dynamics (HYMTF) announced a research partnership with Toyota Research Institute (TM) this week to use the institute’s large behavior models to accelerate development of its general-purpose humanoid robots. The robotics company also plans to use its electric Atlas robot to accelerate the humanoids. “There has never been a more exciting time for the robotics industry, and we look forward to working with TRI to accelerate the development of general-purpose humanoids,” Robert Playter, chief executive of Boston Dynamics, said in a statement. “This partnership is an example of two companies with a strong research-and-development foundation coming together to work on many complex challenges and build useful robots that solve real-world problems.” Tako, an AI search engine that visualizes information, announced a $5.75 million seed funding round this week. The startup uses the “world’s most authoritative data sources” to generate visuals that provide factual, up-to-date information, it said. With the funding, Tako aims to expand its tech’s capabilities, as well as “further its mission to combat misinformation and false narratives [...]” “Tako grounds research and storytelling in reality by turning real-time, authoritative data into visual representations of knowledge,” Alex Rosenberg, co-founder and chief executive of Tako, said. “We’re making it easier than ever to access and share reliable information. We’ll use this funding to accelerate our plan to index all the world’s authoritative data and push the boundaries of how factual information can be visualized and persuasively shared.” The startup was integrated into Perplexity’s search engine in May. Articul8, a software company focused on generative AI for enterprises, announced a collaboration with Amazon Web Services to help customers building on the AWS platform develop and deploy their generative AI applications faster. The software company provides a full-stack generative AI platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise-grade applications. “Generative AI has the potential to transform entire industries, but its cost, complexity of deployment, and the required expertise around this emerging technology can be intimidating to customers,” Alan Braun, director of technology partnerships at AWS, said. “This Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Articul8 will expand their ability to provide solutions that enable customers to build and deploy enterprise-grade Generative AI applications on AWS and help customers achieve meaningful business outcomes at scale.”

Title: Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher. Case in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date, compared to the broader index's 23% rise. Much of the gains stem from enthusiasm over power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — which includes Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles. By 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study. Also, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note. There’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST). Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period. On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating, The analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from "a paradigm shift in power demand" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development. "We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time," wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team. As Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight. But XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped? With the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. “There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth ahead. If XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

Sorry, dividend investors: You probably won’t be rushing to add Netflix (NFLX) to your portfolios. During the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, CFO Spencer Neuman said that the company has "no plans to increase leverage to buy back stock or to issue a dividend." Neuman said Netflix is still prioritizing “profitable growth by reinvesting in our business” and maintaining “ample liquidity.” Wall Street expects Netflix's full-year free cash flow to top $10 billion in 2026, according to Visible Alpha data. Still, Neuman said Netflix isn’t planning to change its capital allocation strategy. The company said Thursday that it repurchased $1.7 billion of its shares during the third quarter, with more than $3 billion of currently authorized buybacks remaining. “In terms of [the] kind of future of free cash flow, well, that future of throwing off tens of billions of free cash flow, that would be a great future and would be a nice challenge to have,” said Neuman on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. “But no change to our capital allocation policy.” Netflix reported third-quarter results on Thursday. The company's stock was recently up more than 10%. Other big tech companies have a history of issuing dividends—including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week; Netflix (NFLX) shares are surging after the streaming giant grew subscribers and beat analysts' estimates; CVS Health (CVS) shares are tumbling after it replaced its CEO; Apple (AAPL) shares are moving higher on strong iPhone 16 sales in China; and Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to climb after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

Title: Nvidia facing a 'generational' opportunity, stock has nearly 40% upside left: BofA

Investing.com -- Bank of America analysts on Thursday reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and lifted the price target from $165 to $190, implying nearly 40% upside from current levels. BofA also hiked its 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 13% and 20%, respectively. The bank believes that Nvidia, which holds an 80-85% market share, is facing "generational opportunity" in a total addressable market (TAM) exceeding $400 billion, a significant jump from the current year's projections. Analysts said their bullish stance on the stock has been bolstered by several recent industry developments – TSMC’s recent blowout report, AMD’s AI event, and strong Blackwell demand, among others – as well as the company's robust competitive positioning. Moreover, they highlight Nvidia's underestimated enterprise partnerships with major firms like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as its software offerings. “NVDA’s engagements span multiple verticals, and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,” they noted. BofA projects that Nvidia’s free cash flow (FCF) at 45-50% margin remains underappreciated, as it is nearly double the average of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech giants. “In $ terms, NVDA could take in $200bn+ of FCF over the next two years, rivaling that of AAPL and providing growth optionality,” analysts said. In its bull case scenario, BofA suggests that Nvidia could outperform expectations if the networking segment mix reaches 17-18%, driven by the ramp-up of its Spectrum switch and potential market share gains in Ethernet. This could conceptually lead to sales exceeding $200 billion in the fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, there is potential for gross margins to improve toward the mid-70% range, factoring in system mix shifts and better yields from the Blackwell product line.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.52%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.51%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+0.64%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD+1.27%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Major U.S. indexes were higher at midday Thursday, as a strong report on demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all advanced. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) reported profit soared on demand for AI chips, sending its U.S.-listed shares to an all-time high. The news helped drive Nvidia shares to a record high as well. Blackstone (BX) shares also surged to a fresh high after the asset manager said its profit jumped as it brought in more investments. Elevance Health (ELV) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the insurer reported a weaker-than-expected profit and lowered its guidance as changes in Medicaid slashed membership rolls. Shares of CSX (CSX) dropped as the freight shipper’s results missed estimates and it cut its outlook as Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted operations. Lucid Group (LCID) shares sank as the struggling luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker announced a $1.67 billion stock sale and warned it would have a larger quarterly loss than expected. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and yen, but lost ground to the pound. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%), Micron Technology (MU-1.86%), and Broadcom (AVGO+0.06%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.52%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.51%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE+2.25%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER+1.64%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller admits he has made more than a few mistakes in his career. Selling his Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) shares earlier this year was one of them. In an interview with Bloomberg TV Wednesday, Druckenmiller said he sold all of his Nvidia holdings when the stock was priced somewhere between $800 and $950. “It was a big mistake,” Druckenmiller, chief executive of Duquesne Family Office, said. Nvidia carried out a 10-for-1 stock split in June, when its shares were near a then-record of $1,200 apiece. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company were up 3% in pre-market trading as of Thursday morning, set to open at $139.82 each. Despite some volatility, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 180% so far this year — and is on track to reach another record high this week. The chip giant now has a market capitalization of $3.33 trillion, the second-largest in the world behind Apple (AAPL+0.64%). While the investor had hoped to hold onto his shares of the chipmaker “for years,” Druckenmiller thought the valuation was rich after the stock tripled in a year. “I think Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down we’d get involved again,” Druckenmiller said. “But right now, I’m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.” Druckenmiller said that despite the pullback from Nvidia, he remains optimistic about artificial intelligence. He said his investment firm is eyeing other ways to keep his foot in the door in the booming sector. The investor has a net worth of $9.98 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. While Nvidia isn’t set to report its latest quarterly earnings until late November, Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.52%) (TSMC) strong results Thursday have helped fuel confidence that the AI boom could extend into next year and beyond. Earlier this month, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for its highly-anticipated Blackwell chip is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker rode demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology to record third-quarter profits; Expedia (EXPE) shares are taking off after a report that Uber (UBER) was considering a takeover bid; Netflix (NFLX) is expected to grow its profit and add new subscribers in its third-quarter earnings report after markets close; shares of CSX (CSX) are falling after the railroad operator said it expects to see a drop in fourth-quarter sales on hurricane disruptions and lower coal demand; and United Airlines (UAL) shares are in focus after jumping 12% yesterday. Here's what investors need to know today. Fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported record net income of 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion) for the third quarter, a 54% year-over-year increase. TSMC's revenue also hit a record, jumping 39% to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion). Both surpassed consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. U.S-listed shares of TSMC are surging 9% in premarket trading and shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are all up at least 3%. Shares of online travel company Expedia (EXPE) are jumping 6% in premarket trading after a report that Uber Technologies (UBER) has considered a takeover bid. The Financial Times said that Uber executives "approached advisers in recent months" about a potential takeover bid of Expedia, and that "there are no current discussions." Shares of Uber are sliding by about 3%. Netflix (NFLX) shares are edging higher in premarket trading as investors anticipate the after-the-bell release of the streaming giant's third-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project Netflix will report a 33% year-over-year jump in net income to $2.24 billion, while its expected revenue of $9.77 billion would be a 14% improvement. Investors also will be watching for Netflix's subscriber totals, which are expected to increase by 4 million from the prior quarter and over 30 million more than last year to reach 282 million. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) warned that its operations would be impacted by the damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton that hit the Southeast recently, and that low fuel prices and sagging demand for coal could lead to a $200 million fourth-quarter hit. For the third quarter, CSX reported earnings per share (EPS) of 46 cents on revenue of $3.62 billion, below analysts' estimates of 48 cents on revenue of $3.68 billion. Its shares are about 5% lower in premarket trading. Investors are watching United Airlines (UAL) after its shares reached their highest levels in more than four years Wednesday. United stock jumped more than 12% in the prior session after it announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, its first since the pandemic, and it reported quarterly earnings above estimates. United Airline shares are little changed in premarket trading.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

U.S.-listed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares jumped 9% Thursday morning after the chipmaker posted robust quarterly earnings and projected a buoyant outlook on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported a 54% year-over-year rise in third-quarter net income of 325.26 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion), up from NT$211 billion. The profit figure by the world's largest contract chip manufacturer beat the NT$300.78 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. TSMC also reported a 39% jump in revenue to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion) for the quarter and a 57.8% gross margin, above analysts' estimates and the guidance it gave for both in the second quarter. "Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies," TSMC Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wendell Huang said. "Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies." TSMC's upbeat earnings, in contrast to Dutch semiconductor-gear manufacturer ASML Holding's (ASML) downbeat outlook earlier in the week, restored investor faith in the AI boom Thursday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all rose. TSMC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei called the demand for AI “real" in the earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. TSMC American depositary receipts (ADRs) have almost doubled this year.UPDATE—Oct. 17, 2024: This article has been updated to include a comment from the CEO and a refreshed share price.

Title: Down 5%, What's Happening With Nvidia Stock?

POLAND - 2024/09/30: In this photo illustration, a Nvidia logo is displayed on a smartphone with ... [+] binary code in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell by close to 4.5% on Tuesday. Peer AMD stock also saw a sharp decline, falling by about 5%. The selloff follows an earnings report by chip manufacturing equipment supplier ASML which indicated weaker-than-expected sales guidance for 2025, raising concerns among investors about global chip demand. ASML produces highly sophisticated photolithography machines, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography equipment, which is essential for manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductor chips including the GPUs that Nvidia sells. ASML said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in at between Euro 30 billion to 35 billion, which is toward the bottom end of its previous forecast, with gross margin forecasts also coming in below estimates. Now, although the decline in guidance was attributed to slower chip demand recovery outside of the AI sector, Nvidia, being the world’s biggest semiconductor company by market cap, was impacted considerably. Additionally, there have been reports that the Biden administration may restrict sales of advanced AI processors to some Persian Gulf countries, citing national security concerns. This stems from worries that these countries could act as a conduit for China to acquire U.S. semiconductor technology that is currently banned from direct export to China. While Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution, Here’s A Better AI Pick Than Nvidia stock The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? To be fair, Nvidia’s sharp stock decline on Tuesday may have been an overreaction. Much of the capital expenditure cuts that are likely impacting ASML potentially come from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung foundries, rather than from TSMC, Nvidia’s primary manufacturing partner. However, Nvidia stock still appears pricey. At its current market price of $132 per share, the stock trades at about 46x consensus FY’25 earnings and 33x FY’26 earnings. There are also risks ahead. See our scenario analysis on Could Nvidia Stock Crash To $40? The big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs. Competition is also mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, the economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenue. There are concerns that companies are investing in AI due to the fear of missing out, rather than focusing on returns. This could eventually lead to reduced capital spending and impact Nvidia, We value NVDA stock at $88 per share, about 33% below the current market price.

Title: JPMorgan Chase is winning the AI banking race — and its lead is getting bigger

JPMorgan Chase (JPM-1.02%) held onto its spot as the artificial intelligence adoption leader in the banking sector. The largest U.S. bank has the highest volume of AI talent, which has grown 16% in the past 12 months, and has more AI researchers than its seven biggest competitors combined, according to the latest Evident AI Index, released Thursday. “JPMorganChase is unquestionably still the bank to beat when it comes to AI maturity,” said Evident co-founder and co-CEO Annabel Ayles. “The pace of its AI adoption is remarkable for an organization of its size and scale.” JPMorgan had been investing in AI for years before the chatbot craze took hold with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. The financial institution hired its head of AI research, Manuela Veloso, in 2018 and has since grown its use cases to more than 400. And JPMorgan is already beginning to see the dollar value of its commitment. Company President Daniel Pinto said last month that the bank is expecting to see nearly $2 billion in returns from its investment into the technology this year, particularly related to fraud prevention. “Going forward, we think that artificial intelligence, large language models will have — and we are doing a lot of work on this over the medium- to long-term — a big impact in improving processes and efficiencies in the operational services that we have,” Pinto said. Since Evident began its rankings in early 2023, the top four banks have not only remained in their positions but have continued to plow forward. “The leaders are just pulling ahead and leading more,” Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident co-founder and co-CEO, said in an interview. Evident evaluates 50 major banks in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific based on public data relating to AI adoption, scoring the institutions based on talent, innovation, transparency, and leadership. While all 50 banks in the index have ramped up their adoption efforts since last year, the top 10 are improving twice as fast as the rest of the field, Evident found. Mousavizadeh said banks that are committing to AI are going all in: hiring, poaching talent, figuring out internal systems, testing, and partnering with major players such as Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.16%). “We can see these dynamics are creating bifurcation in the banking system,” Mousavizadeh said. “If you are slightly standing still, at what point does it become almost impossible to catch up? I would say we’re 18 months away from that.” A number of banks are doing the opposite of standing still. The biggest riser in this year’s index is Morgan Stanley (MS-2.32%), which jumped seven points and landed itself a spot in the top 10. The investment bank first partnered with OpenAI in March 2023, when it became the AI startup’s only wealth management partner. The firm rolled out the AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, a generative AI chatbot that helped financial advisors access the bank’s vast array of technical know-how, in September 2023. And this past June, the bank rolled out Debrief, a generative AI assistant that will support its financial advisors, built on OpenAI’s GPT-4. “The rise of HSBC (HSBC-1.20%) and Morgan Stanley show that it’s still possible for banks that have been slower out of the gates on AI to catch up and even overtake the field,” Ayles said. “The race for AI adoption is far from run, but there’s a growing gap between the leaders and the rest of the field. The lower ranking institutions need to pick up the pace if they wish to go the distance.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
