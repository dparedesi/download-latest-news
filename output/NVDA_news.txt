Title: This AI Fund’s 7.3% Payout Looks Great, But One Chart Screams ‘Sell’

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shot of two young businesspeople working ,Two business man and women discussing over digital tablet ... More at desk in office . Success, Teamwork,Technology, Working, There’s a 7.3%-paying AI fund out there that looks like the perfect buy—7.3% yield, growing payout and special dividends. Yet, if you hold this one, I urge you to sell yesterday. It’s a dilemma we’ve all faced: There’s a stock or fund we’re aching to buy—but there are just one or two things holding us back. That’s certainly the case here. In fact, at pretty well any other time, we’d fall all over ourselves to buy this dominating tech play. At my CEF Insider service, we’ve done just that in the past. But not today. Today we’re putting this one on the shelf—and I urge you to do the same. But not to worry: There will be another opportunity to strike here. Let’s rattle through this quixotic fund’s strengths. Then we’ll get to the reasons for our decision to steer clear of it. First, let me introduce this fund, whose name includes a clue as to both its appeal and our reason for selling: the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). We held AIO in CEF Insider from 2020 to 2023. And it yields even more today than it did when we bought back then: 7.3% versus 6.4%. And, as mentioned, the portfolio is strong. In fact, management has done a solid job playing the AI trend, combining shares of firms that directly participate in AI development, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META), with those smartly adopting AI to cut costs and boost profits, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and insurer Progressive (PGR). AIO’s team is savvy about going beyond the obvious AI plays to find companies that are underpriced relative to how much AI can transform them. The fund’s 101% total NAV return since its launch, which was just before the pandemic, is testament to that. AIO Total Returns (Total NAV return tracks the performance of a CEF’s portfolio, including dividends collected, rather than its return based on market price—it’s the best indicator of management’s stock-picking prowess.) That strong return has, in turn, helped AIO not only raise its regular dividend but pay out huge special dividends. The fund is overdue for another. In short, AIO is a strong fund with a lot going for it: right mandate for the times, great management and a payout set to rise. And yet it’s still a sell. Let’s get into why now. Astute market followers might think that, since the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—has fallen to one of its lowest levels this year, concern about a selloff is rising. That suggests complacency, which is risky considering simmering global-trade issues and still-unresolved U.S. tariffs. The good news is that President Donald Trump will likely settle on a lower level of tariffs than what was feared in April. Even so, volatility is lower than it should be, given trade worries—and a spike could hit AIO hard, especially when you consider the factor we’ll look at next. AIO Premium to NAV Above we see the fund’s premium to NAV, which plainly tells us that investors are paying 8.8% more for AIO than its portfolio is actually worth. That’s the fund’s highest premium ever, and AIO hasn’t seen a double-digit discount for more than a year. That, combined with the potential for higher market volatility, is why it is time to step back from this one. Of course, a selloff would likely see AIO’s premium drop to a big discount, as occurred in April. If so, the fund would be an attractive buy. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if we see this play out in 2025—very likely by the end of 2026. Until then, it’s time to pass on AIO and wait for its premium to evaporate. Then we’d be nicely set to scoop it up, ride it back to a premium (enjoying its payouts as we do), then sell. It’s the classic CEF profit cycle. AIO is simply at the wrong end of it—for now.

Title: 3 ‘Secret’ Income Plays Throwing Off Huge 7.5%+ Dividend Yields

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Finance I’m just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn’t?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs). For those “in the know” about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us—and I’d argue they’re not even the best one! The best-in-class CEFs out there—and here I’d definitely include the three we’re going to get into below—also offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly. And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It’s an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV). This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can’t issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you’re buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice “rinse-and-repeat” cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. Of course, these kinds of opportunities don’t tend to last, and in the last year we’ve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That’s got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let’s look at three. First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today. That’s despite its generous 7.9% dividend, which should be getting more attention. So, by the way, should the fund’s performance. ETO Total Returns Beyond the discount and dividend, ETO’s 12.3% annualized return on NAV (orange line above) should also be a shiny lure for investors. But as you can see, ETO’s market price–based total return (in purple) has lagged, inflating its discount from where it was a half-decade ago. That’s clearly an error on the market’s part, and it makes ETO well worth a look today. We’ll find an even bigger discrepancy with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB), a 9.1%-yielder holding S&P 500 mainstays like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). This high-powered roster should put ETB on investors’ radar, yet the gap between its total NAV return (in orange below) and total price return (in purple) is huge. ETB Total Returns With a 11.3% annualized return over the last half-decade (based on NAV), ETB’s managers have clearly done their job. Yet investors have taken little notice, causing its market price–based return to lag, and its discount to widen to 7.8%. Completing the picture is the fact that ETB has averaged a 1.7% premium in the last decade. That gives it plenty of upside as its overdone discount flips to the fund’s “normal” premium. Finally, consider the John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO), which subscribers to my CEF Insider service might remember. We’ve held BTO twice in the past and have booked nice double-digit total returns both times. BTO, which yields 7.5%, focuses on the financial sector, mainly banking firms, with M&T Bank (MTB), Mississippi-based Renasant Corp. (RNST) and US Bancorp (USB) all top holdings. BTO Total Returns These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price–based return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund’s long-term trend, which includes a premium that’s hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO’s pricing went from around par earlier this year to today’s premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
