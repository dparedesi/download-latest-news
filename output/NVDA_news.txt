Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late.

Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. 79% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost thirty percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-why-buy-000903558.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker

Intel’s (INTC+9.25%) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.10%), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.52%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.11%) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO+0.64%) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival, as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports and eyed likely policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up slightly in morning trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday, as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back towards optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges.

Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to ar 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August.

China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks

Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, with the major indexes hoping to build on the previous day's surge as investors assessed another round of big bank earnings and a fresh reading on retail sales. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all meandered slightly above the flatline in early trading. Markets are still enjoying some relief from a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. An upbeat sales outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, 2330.TW) boosted optimism for AI hardware demand this year. The main chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) on Thursday booked a 57% rise in net profit to hit a quarterly record. TSMC shares popped over 5% after its earnings report, while Nvidia stock added 1%. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped nearly 0.1%, weighed on by a slide in UnitedHealth (UNH) following the health care provider's disappointing quarterly print. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here.

Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT).

Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT, Financial) shares jumped 15.5%, while Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI, Financial) advanced 3.4%, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS, Financial) gaining 9.6% and IonQ Inc. (IONQ, Financial) rising 1.9%. It reflects a growing interest by investors, spurred by the growing corporate commitment to quantum technologies. However, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial) has been the sector's biggest cheerleader. In the case of Mitra Azizirad, COO of Microsoft's strategic missions and technology division: from 2020, talk will be of businesses moving to become the familiar 'quantum-ready' by 2025. This push is backed up by Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial), which announced that it will host a Quantum Day' at its upcoming GTC conference and is committing to integrate quantum computing within classical systems. Despite some industry sceptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who estimates practical quantum computing is still a couple of decades away, companies are proactively creating the work environments that will make it happen. Microsoft has programs for businesses to help tackle this technological evolution, and Nvidia is now recruiting for roles in quantum research. Since Google broke onto the quantum scene with its Willow quantum chip, the quantum sector has also come under the microscope. Companies in this developing quantum era are positioning themselves for long-term growth and are being watched closely by investors and analysts alike. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wednesday's stock rally sent Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares surging 3.3%, driven higher by a broader tech sector surge after four banks reported stronger earnings than expected. The latest strategic investment by Nvidia shows its bravery towards industrial AI and robotics. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The chip giant has also provided Taiwan's MetAI with capital in its $4 million seed funding round, making Nvidia its first investment in a Taiwanese company. Kenmec Mechanical Engineering, Solomon Technology, SparkLabs Taiwan, Addin Ventures, and Upstream Ventures were other participants in the funding round. MetAI builds AI-powered digital twin platforms for its own advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities, smart warehouses, and automation systems. It converts a CAD file into a stripped-down SimReady 3D environment within minutes to ease the time to market digital twins for industrial applications. As generative physical AI is an area of increasing focus, Nvidia's partnership with MetAI is a holistic approach to the integration of predictive physical AI that can be trained in simulation environments to deploy robots in autonomous systems. Later this year, the company launched its Mega framework within the Omniverse platform to further digital twin products in the company's broader AI ecosystem. CEO and co-founder of MetAI Daniel Yu said that digital twins have slowed physical AI down in the past because they took so long to be developed. MetAI's hope is to ramp this up, creating synthetic data in its AI-powered digital twin environments. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio
