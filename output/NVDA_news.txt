We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. The global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump’s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market’s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump’s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead. Fidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector’s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired “soft landing,” says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates. The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.

As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals. Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Average Upside Potential: 36.0% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley gave an “Overweight” rating on the company’s stock, providing a price target of $152. The analyst noted that China’s DeepSeek, an AI model matching its American rivals in performance and at a much cheaper cost, established some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) around export controls and longer-term investment. Despite these challenges, Moore opines that near-term checks remain strong for its Hopper platform. The analyst believes that Blackwell’s supply visibility has been building and that customers’ desire to spend remains clearly visible. Elsewhere, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial upped the company’s stock to “Strong Buy,” raising its price objective to $220. Even though DeepSeek's R1 AI model has been claiming competitive features at lower costs, Tigress Financial noted unknown capabilities and security concerns. The firm lauded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s critical role in AI and data center growth and sees it as a long-term beneficiary of continued investments. Furthermore, lawmakers in the US have plans to ban DeepSeek. The AI infrastructure build-out continues to act as a major tailwind for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, cloud service providers, sovereign states, and consumer internet companies have been fueling demand for AI computing power. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.” Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fears Over Tariffs And AI Spending Overwhelm Better Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/02/08/fears-over-tariffs-and-ai-spending-overwhelm-better-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-02-08T15:52:41Z
Full Content:
Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 77% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only NVIDIA (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence (AI) spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10-20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: The 'Magnificent Seven' era is ending, says the Bank of America strategist who named it

The man who coined the term “Magnificent Seven,” which refers to seven high-performing tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOGL-3.27%), Amazon (AMZN-3.97%), Apple (AAPL-2.39%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.30%), Microsoft (MSFT-1.47%), Meta (META+0.66%), and Tesla (TSLA-3.66%) — now believes its golden era is about to end, and that’s due to the AI battle driven by DeepSeek. Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America (BAC-0.43%) Global Research, warned in his latest note that the U.S. stock market’s global dominance will peak in 2025 and is nearing its end. Read here: Which stocks are in the Magnificent 7? The arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup that has developed AI models comparable to those of OpenAI but apparently at a fraction of the cost and energy, has caused turmoil in the stock market, leading to a significant sell-off in the tech sector. In his note, Hartnett indicated that spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach its peak soon. “US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned,” the strategist wrote. “‘Magnificent 7’ becomes ‘Lagnificent 7,’ supports broadening of US and global equity and credit markets.” Beyond AI, Hartnett sees other key drivers of U.S. market outperformance—such as excess fiscal support and immigration—waning this year. He doubts U.S. stocks will continue to outpace global markets, citing an expected slowdown in government spending and tighter immigration policies. Fiscal spending has been high in recent years, but President Trump is now pushing for extensive cuts, even creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hartnett has advised investors to seek cheaper international markets instead of pursuing overpriced U.S. stocks. He noted that equities from Brazil, Germany, the UK, and Canada have provided higher returns than Wall Street’s S&P 500-listed stocks.

Title: Stock Markets Analysis: A Weak-Handed Exit

The saga showed how quickly markets can react and readjust. Some of the biggest stocks out there – global, household names – dove hard. Things got ugly for a bit. But for long-term, data-based investors, DeepSeek’s shake out was a gift because it revealed the “weak hands.” By “weak hands,” I mean investors who lack conviction in their trades. Basically, they see an opportunity on Wednesday but then see a disaster on Thursday and sell off. In this latest iteration, these traders probably bought into AI late last year, then were spooked early this year when things got chaotic. These “last in, first out” traders just pulled off a weak-handed exit. But here’s the thing – Big Money kept buying throughout the carnage. That data provided bullish conviction. When the Big Money Index (BMI) is heading higher, my bullish stance is grounded and backed by years of money flows. And the BMI is rapidly gaining, proving that money is being put to work: As the chart shows, in two weeks, the BMI rose from 37% to 51%. That reflects Big Money accumulation. So Big Money bought, but some stocks were slaughtered? Yes. Technology stock liquidations were strong after the DeepSeek announcement. Many of the hottest names and industry groups were beaten to a pulp. For instance, using the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) as a proxy, we can see semis had one of their steepest daily declines in years, crashing 9.8% on Jan. 27. Using another popular ticker as a proxy, the bellwether semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) slid 17% that same day. On the surface, it felt like doom was not just near, but here. However, acting on emotions is rarely profitable. It’s better to use cold, hard data as a guide. And when possible, dive deep – index-level analysis is the tip of the iceberg. As the weak hands panicked, MAPsignals data noted healthy accumulation. From Jan. 27-29, there were 225 Big Money buy signals versus 112 sell signals. That’s twice as many buys as sells, all during “doom.” Money rarely exits markets, it simply rotates. You can see Big Money was buying across the board: The sectors that attracted heavy capital inflows were technology, health care, and discretionary: The MAPsignals stance that Big Money buyers are after high-quality names, particularly in the technology sector, is strengthened by the DeepSeek situation. Of course, sitting through the wreckage wasn’t fun. But that’s part of being an investor. Under the surface, it’s clear Big Money is chasing high-quality stocks in a handful of sectors. You can’t tell that from the gloomy DeepSeek-related headlines, but you can with a MAP. Even though some assets dipped, the BMI is lifting. It’s the weak hands waving goodbye!

Title: Big Tech is a pawn in US-China trade war. Here's why some will feel the heat more than others.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President Trump’s trade war with China kicked off on Tuesday, with the White House implementing a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods coming into the US. Silicon Valley’s biggest companies are already getting caught up in what could turn into a series of tit-for-tat actions between the world’s two largest economies. On Tuesday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that it is opening an antitrust investigation into Google (GOOG, GOOGL). The agency didn’t provide any additional details about the move. Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that China is considering launching an antitrust investigation into Apple’s (AAPL) App Store practices. SAMR officials have been speaking with Apple executives for some time already, but the timing of the potential probe sets up Apple as another pawn in the economic chess match between the superpowers. And according to the Financial Times, Chinese officials are considering launching a probe into Intel (INTC) on top of an ongoing investigation into Nvidia (NVDA). It’s all a part of China’s effort to punish the US’s most prominent companies and inflict its own pain on the US, as the two nations continue to battle it out in the weeks and months ahead. Here’s a rundown of which companies will feel the heat, and which should remain relatively unscathed. For now. Apple is taking hits from both the US and China in the countries’ latest economic skirmish. The US kicked things off by levying its tariff on goods made in China, which includes Apple products and its all-important iPhone. That would drive prices on Apple’s hardware higher, potentially by as much as 10%, or force Apple to eat some or all of the tariff cost, lowering iPhone margins. Apple can also file for an exemption to the tariffs, which it did during the prior Trump administration. That would allow it to bring its devices into the US without having to deal with the 10% levy. But so far, there's no word on whether it's able to do so. China is now retaliating via its antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store practices. The investigation itself isn’t unique. The European Union and other nations have forced Apple to make changes to its App Store requirements and payment system in recent years. And the Justice Department has filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging it purposely makes it difficult for consumers to use third-party hardware or switch to another band of devices. But tariffs and China’s antitrust action are unlikely to significantly damage Apple finances. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? According to BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan, Apple could move device assembly to factories in other countries, something the company has been doing since COVID exposed weakness in its supply chain. If Apple builds 80% of its devices outside of China, it would only see a $0.05 earnings per share impact this fiscal year. If 50% are sourced from outside of China that could rise to between $0.07 and $0.12 per share. China’s antitrust crackdown would similarly put a dent in Apple’s earnings, but it wouldn’t be a wipeout, Wedbush’s Dan Ives explained in an investor note. The company pulled in $26 billion in Services revenue, which includes App Store sales, in Q1 and $124 billion in overall sales for the quarter. According to Ives, Apple generates $5 billion a year via its Chinese App Store, which is a relatively thin slice of the company’s overall pie. “It’s less about revenue exposure for investors and more about building US/China tensions with US Big Tech in line for retaliatory shots across the bow,” Ives wrote in his memo. Intel, Google, and Nvidia are also facing potential antitrust investigations as part of China’s response to US tariffs, and it could mean trouble for Intel in particular. The chipmaker generates the bulk of its revenue through sales in China. In 2024, China accounted for $15.5 billion of the company’s $53.1 billion in revenue. The US, Intel’s second-largest region, made up $12.9 billion. Intel is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, putting the company in a particularly precarious situation if China decides to take some kind of action against the company. Google, for its part, does very little business in China. After pulling its operations from the company years ago, the only real presence the company has is selling ads for Chinese businesses looking to reach foreign customers. “It’s almost comical that China is considering regulating Google — since Google is effectively banned there,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a research note. Things are a bit shakier for Nvidia. The company is under pressure from both China and the US after China launched a probe into the company in December following then-President Biden's move to restrict exports of certain Nvidia chips to the country. And after the debut of DeepSeek's AI models, which the company developed using underpowered Nvidia chips, the US is considering tightening those export restrictions even further. China accounted for $5.4 billion of Nvidia’s $35 billion in revenue in Q3, well behind the US’s $14.8 billion in sales. But as one of the AI industry’s largest markets, China is an important piece of the company’s overall strategy. It’s not entirely clear what an antitrust probe would mean for Nvidia in China, but if the US forces the company to restrict more chips than it already does, it could face a revenue headwind out of the region. For now, Big Tech has to contend with the US’s tariffs. But with China signaling it’s willing to put a hurting on Silicon Valley companies if Trump pushes things further, firms won’t be able to rest comfortably for some time.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. PwC highlights that the automotive semiconductor market reached $76 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $117 billion by 2028, driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Power semiconductors, particularly those utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are expected to reach $6 billion, comprising 18% of the market by 2028. Meanwhile, automotive system-on-chip (SoC) revenue was $7 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR through 2028, supporting real-time data processing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, prompting major economies to pursue self-sufficiency. By 2027, approximately $400 billion in government funding is expected to be allocated to semiconductor initiatives. The US has already awarded $29.5 billion in grants and $25.1 billion in loans, with total investments projected to reach $348 billion by 2030. The European Union has allocated $46 billion for incentives, while China has invested over $190 billion through its National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund and local initiatives. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have also introduced tax incentives and subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor production. The demand for custom ICs tailored to specific applications is surging, especially in data centers, video processing, and network security. By 2028, the market for data center custom ICs is expected to reach $24 billion. AI is a critical growth driver for the semiconductor industry, requiring GPUs, accelerators, and HBM. The AI-specific silicon market is forecasted to reach $150 billion by 2028. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. For this article, we selected companies that operate in the semiconductor sector that are in focus as investors exit tech stocks amid fears of an AI bubble. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

JP Morgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Nvidia, noting that past innovation cycles suggest that efficiency and technology improvements drive further adoption and innovation. Analysts led by Harlan Sur said that after the launch of the DeepSeek R1 large language model last week, investors were concerned regarding the intermediate and long-term effects for AI semiconductor spending given the Chinese startup's claim regarding their compute efficiency in terms of cost and performance for training/inferencing AI models. However, the analysts noted that despite the impressive cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s training and inference, several questions remain unanswered, including the complete training costs for R1 and the extent of reliance on larger open-source foundation models developed earlier. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the chip stocks in focus amid tech selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Amazon plans an AI spending spree, joining Meta, Microsoft, and Google

Amazon (AMZN-3.97%) is the latest technology giant to announce it will continue spending massive amounts of cash on artificial intelligence, even after Chinese startup DeepSeek’s success. CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call on Thursday that the company’s $26.3 billion in capital expenditures last quarter is “reasonably representative” of what has been budgeted for 2025. If continued, that would put Amazon on track to spend more than $100 billion this year, which most of the cash supporting AI services and tech infrastructure. “The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for [Amazon Web Services],” Jassy said on the call, calling that spending a “good sign” for AWS. “[W]e think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it and with inference being a core building block, just like compute and storage and database.” Amazon has introduced a number of new AI-based products and invested heavily in Anthropic, a startup founded by ex-OpenAI staffers. The Seattle-based company in December even unveiled its own AI training chips, the Trainium3, which are expected to be available in late 2025. It’s not the only tech leader planning to spend billions on AI this year, as demand remains intense. Microsoft (MSFT-1.47%) in early January said it plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers in its fiscal year 2025, which ends on June 30. The data centers will be used for training and deploying AI models and cloud-based applications. More than half of the investment will be focused in the U.S., Microsoft President Brad Smith said at the time. “As we look into the future, it’s clear that artificial intelligence is poised to become a world-changing GPT [General-Purpose Technology],” Smith said in a statement. “AI promises to drive innovation and boost productivity in every sector of the economy. Later in January, Meta Platforms (META+0.66%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post that the Facebook and Instagram-owned will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI this year. He wrote that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Google-parent (GOOGL-3.27%) Alphabet said it would spend $75 billion on AI this year, 29% greater than Wall Street had expected. “The cost of actually using [AI] is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on an earnings call, adding that Google is investing to “meet the moment.” OpenAI last month announced Stargate, a planned $500 billion AI infrastructure project backed by SoftBank (SFTBY-2.14%) and Oracle (ORCL+1.37%), among others. That cash would be doled out over the next four years. Silicon Valley’s major spending on AI was called into question after DeepSeek claimed it had spent cost just $5.6 million to train and develop an AI model that rivaled models made by OpenAI and Meta. Tech stocks entered a freefall after Wall Street caught wind, giving chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA+0.30%) the biggest one-day drop in market value in history. However, some tech leaders are calling into question whether what DeepSeek achieved was actually done on such a low budget. Meta has reportedly set up “war rooms” to investigate the models, while Microsoft is probing whether DeepSeek had access to OpenAI’s tech.

DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off that cost Nvidia $600 billion in market value. But JPMorgan (JPM-0.18%) Chase says the AI chipmaker is bound to benefit from the Chinese startup. The Hangzhou-based artificial intelligence startup sent shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and Wall Street last month after raising questions about Big Tech’s big spending on AI infrastructure. But despite the AI-driven stock rally losing $1 trillion in value, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research analysts said in a new report that DeepSeek will likely have a positive impact on companies such as Amazon (AMZN-3.97%), Meta (META+0.66%), and Google (GOOGL-3.27%) parent Alphabet, as well as chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.30%). The Chinese startup launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models in January that performed on par with similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic, while its open-source DeepSeek-V3 model released in December also performed competitively with AI models from the U.S.-based companies — for far less money and less advanced chips. According to the V3 technical paper, the model cost $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. firms, meanwhile, are spending billions on tens of thousands of Nvidia’s more powerful H100 chips, which are not allowed to be sold to China under U.S. export controls. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday. “Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Other chip firms such as Broadcom (AVGO-3.06%), Marvell (MRVL-7.26%), and Micron (MU-2.79%) are also likely to benefit from DeepSeek, according to JPMorgan. Chip pioneer Intel (INTC-1.63%), however, stands to lose out from DeepSeek, analysts said, because demand for its central processing units, or CPUs, will decrease as amid the shift to accelerated computing. JPMorgan analysts also said they “believe the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit” following the open-source AI model advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek and China’s Alibaba (BABA+3.17%). The improved cost efficiency “should accelerate” AI development and adoption, leading to more consumption, the analysts said, adding that they “expect heavy capital expenditures investment” by Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta to continue in the medium term. Meta is expected to benefit from increased open-source model adoption as it builds its next-generation open-source Llama 4 model, JPMorgan said. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as “good for the world,” said DeepSeek’s breakthrough shows the need for a global open-source standard led by the U.S. Amazon, which introduced DeepSeek-R1 in its cloud platforms, will likely benefit from providing more open-source AI model options, analysts said, because it will increase AI demand and usage, driving monetization. Meanwhile Alphabet is also likely to benefit from the lower training and inferencing costs demonstrated by DeepSeek, JPMorgan said, because it will be able to accelerate development and adoption of AI agents, as well as other AI applications such as Google’s NotebookLM and Gemini Advanced with Deep Research. Google on Wednesday made its “most capable” AI model, Gemini 2.0, available to everyone. At its unveiling in December, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said Gemini 2.0 “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Hidden Dangers Of Dividends With ‘DeepSeek Exposure’
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/06/the-hidden-dangers-of-dividends-with-deepseek-exposure/

SUQIAN, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - An illustration photo shows the logo of DeepSeek and ChatGPT in ... [+] Suqian, Jiangsu province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Many of you have written in asking about DeepSeek’s latest release and its potential effects on our dividends. Let’s discuss the latest in AI because, yes, there are ripples into Dividendland that are not fully appreciated by mainstream investors. First the DeepSeek disruption in AI, and let’s take vanilla dividend darling Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which yields 12.2% as our example. Is that big divvie still safe and secure? Income seekers are constantly staring at the fund, writing in to ask me if they have permission to: Not quite. And definitely not now. QYLD is like a breakfast beer. There is a time and a place for it, but it is not something we want to indulge in daily. QYLD’s strategy is a straightforward approach. It buys the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 and simultaneously sells (“writes”) covered calls on the index itself to generate income. In doing so, QYLD sacrifices potential upside for real cash from the option premiums it collects. Result: Its 12.2% yield. But note that this options writing does not guarantee a floor on the price of the fund itself. Again, there is a time and a place to buy this thing. Since we last discussed QYLD, it has returned a terrific 26.7% in just 15 months. If you missed it then, well, I wouldn’t chase it now. Especially with the latest DeepSeek news weighing on some outsized positions held by the fund. AI chatbot DeepSeek sank the Nasdaq last week. Nvidia (NVDA) shares nosedived from their nosebleed level, shedding 16% in a week. The “problem” for NVDA was that Chinese engineers created a more efficient AI mousetrap, one that does not require endless processing power to run computation after computation after computation. DeepSeek takes shortcuts to find answers, similar to our human brains. While DeepSeek used NVDA chips, evidence suggests that the company developed its model using less powerful processors. Even if DeepSeek may have obtained NVDA chips illegally via sketchy third parties in Singapore to evade export restrictions, the big takeaway is that its engineers still were not working with the latest chips. So, DeepSeek’s technologists have now shown the world that you can do AI with less money and complex tech. (And they open sourced their code to cement the accomplishment!) Big picture this is bullish for overall AI adoption. We’ll see greater applications even sooner. But there will be winners and losers and prominent domestic companies here in the US are licking their wounds. Losers in our dividend portfolios? No. We didn’t touch NVDA, which shareholders dumped to the tune of $600 billion from fear that more efficient AI won’t need its newest chips. But even after the selloff, NVDA shares still trade hands at a swollen 26-times sales. (For perspective, Meta Platforms (META) fetches 11-times revenues while Alphabet (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) command 7X and 9X respectively. Price to Sales Ratio Good luck with that. The stock’s paltry 0.03% yield won’t stop sellers. Which is going to weigh on QYLD—it has a 7.7% position in NVDA! I bet most owners of the fund don’t realize this. They see the 12.2% dividend and think “safe” when really this is anything but. QYLD also has a 7.8% position in Microsoft (MSFT), which dropped 6.5% last week in the DeepSeek aftermath. MSFT owns 49% of OpenAI, the “fat cat” of the American AI industry that was caught off-guard by the hungry, savvy Chinese engineers. And here’s some additional irony. In vintage Chinese fashion there is speculation that DeepSeek engineers “distilled” answers from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to train its ChatBot. (The biggest smoking gun? When asked who it was, DeepSeek replied that it was ChatGPT. Ha!) This becomes quite embarrassing when we consider that ChatGPT runs on Microsoft’s Azure servers. Microsoft should have caught this. But no. So, DeepSeek “mind melded” with ChatGPT—and now the “parasite” outperforms its “host.” Bad news for NVDA and MSFT which combine for 15.5% of QYLD. Avoid. And I haven’t even bitten into Apple, which is drifting off to an antiquated tech island of its own. AAPL has no meaningful AI play and its sales malaise reflects this. Revenues have only climbed 2.5% total over the past three years. If not for inflation, the company would have a shrinking top line, and without buybacks, no meaningful increase in earnings! Apple is QYLD’s largest holding at 9.1%, bringing us 24.6% dead NVDA, MSFT and AAPL weight. And “America’s ticker” SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is no safe harbor. (I sarcastically refer to SPY as America’s ticker because it is the most over-owned investment in the land.) SPY carries 19% deadweight in the big three. Bad enough. There was a time and a place for SPY too and yes, it has had an amazing run. But we are entering a “Trump 2.0” stock market with defined winners and losers. Tariffs protect certain sectors and hurt others. Lower regulation generally helps healthcare… except we now have RFK Jr., who scares healthcare investors. And DeepSeek is disrupting tech. It no longer makes sense to own everything. Bye bye, SPY. We should also avoid QYLD’s analogous Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD). XYLD employs a similar strategy to QYLD, but buys S&P 500 stocks while writing covered calls against the index to generate yield. Its 10.6% dividend is enticing, though potentially dicey—XYLD has 20.8% exposure to NVDA, MSFT and AAPL. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Morgan Stanley Thinks The Demand For NVIDIA’s Hopper And Blackwell Chips Remains “Solid,” With DeepSeek Creating “Some Challenges” On The Margins

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As NVIDIA's quarterly earnings draw ever closer, Wall Street analysts are churning out their takes on the GPU manufacturer's prospects with growing regularity. After Citi appreciated NVIDIA's newfound attractive valuation post DeepSeek-induced swoon earlier this week, Morgan Stanley is out today with its much more bullish take on NVIDIA's near-term stock price trajectory. As a refresher, China-based DeepSeek recently shocked the global tech sector with its breakthrough R1 model, which is able to more than compete with OpenAI's o1 model but with just around 1/50th of the typical costs associated with training a complex LLM. However, a new analysis has since then postulated that DeepSeek's CapEx might have been as high as $1.6 billion, entailing operating costs of as much as $944 million. Nonetheless, DeepSeek's R1 model has unleashed a renewed focus on efficiency to the possible detriment of NVIDIA. Coming back, Morgan Stanley continues to see NVIDIA's recent selloff as a "buying opportunity." Nonetheless, the Wall Street titan concedes that the DeepSeek phenomenon has increased "long-term uncertainties" for NVIDIA, and created "some challenges," albeit manageable ones. Morgan Stanley feels that the demand for Hopper and Blackwell chips remains "solid" in the near-term and that the overarching confidence in NVIDIA's growth story will return in the second half of 2025 with a renewed focus on AI inference and ASIC-related enthusiasm. Of course, the growing severity of US chip-based export curbs in relation to China is a key risk for NVIDIA. However, Morgan Stanley remains confident that the GPU manufacturer will be able to wade through these turbulent currents. Elsewhere, a lack of retrenchment among hyperscalers also supports Morgan Stanley's bullish view around NVIDIA. We noted recently that Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Tesla have continued to project elevated CapEx for 2025, despite the DeepSeek phenomenon. NVDA Jan-Q earnings due 2/26 post-market. • Sales Forecast: Expected ~$38B for Jan-Q, $42.5B for Apr-Q with Blackwell ramp-up mid-year. • Valuation: NVDA stock at mid-20s P/E, 25% below ASIC peers after sell-off on AI concerns. • Outlook: Bullish despite recent range-bound… https://t.co/tQBwe4kn9l — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) February 6, 2025 Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, Citi now expects NVIDIA to report $38 billion in revenue for its January-ending quarter, and a whopping $42.5 billion for the April-ending one, bolstered by the Blackwell production ramp-up by mid-year. Interestingly, given the recent correction in NVIDIA shares, Citi has calculated that the stock now has a P/E ratio in the "mid-20s," around 25 percent below its ASIC peers! Finally, Citi expects NVIDIA's margins to bottom out in the April-ending quarter. Given the growing chip restrictions on China, Citi has slightly reduced its price target for NVIDIA shares from $175 to $163 while maintaining an overall 'buy' rating.

(Bloomberg) -- DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose artificial-intelligence model roiled global markets last week, said it would restrict access to its application programming interface service because of shortages with its server capacity. Most Read from Bloomberg Nice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No Bridge Sin puente y sin metro: el nuevo aeropuerto de Lima es una debacle The Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt Marseille In New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay Super Citadel to Leave Namesake Chicago Tower as Employees Relocate In a posting on its website, the company said it suspended the ability of customers to top up their API credits to avoid any broader impact on their services. Any existing stored values won’t be affected, it added. “The existing recharge amount can continue to be used, please understand!” the company said. DeepSeek’s services have been overwhelmed with demand since late January after it unveiled an artificial intelligence chatbot that it says can rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost of competing products. It had previously restricted signups for new users to people with a mainland China telephone number. While the hype around the Chinese company’s latest AI model sparked a $1 trillion rout in US and European technology stocks, it also sparked US efforts to close loopholes to its restrictions on sales of chips used for AI applications. American officials are probing whether DeepSeek acquired Nvidia Corp. semiconductors through third parties in Singapore, circumventing restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier. DeepSeek, whose rock-bottom pricing had alarmed some rivals, also said in the posting that discounts for access to its model would end on Feb. 8. After that, it said that access to the chat model would be 2 yuan per million input tokens and 8 yuan per million output tokens. When its reasoning model goes online, the charges will be 4 yuan per million input tokens and 16 yuan per million output tokens. --With assistance from Luz Ding and Yazhou Sun.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Big Tech’s earnings season is nearly over, with just Amazon and Nvidia left to announce their quarterly performance. And despite uneven reports from some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names so far, AI continues to be the star of the show for Wall Street. Microsoft (MSFT) missed on cloud revenue, Meta (META) said sales growth would slow in the current quarter, Apple (AAPL) fell short of iPhone revenue estimates, and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) disappointed on cloud growth. President Trump’s tariffs on goods out of China, which have kicked off a tit-for-tat trade battle that’s pulling in Google and Apple, and the emergence of DeepSeek’s low-cost AI models haven’t helped things either. But analysts aren’t overly concerned, focusing instead on Big Tech’s long-term AI bets. “Tech sector volatility is likely to continue in the months ahead. But we see the initial set of large-cap tech results as reassuring and believe the AI growth story remains intact,” UBS’s Chief Investment Office team wrote in its Daily Updates note. Nvidia (NVDA), the AI trade’s bellwether, doesn’t report its earnings until Feb. 26, and a miss on earnings or outlook could send AI stocks off the rails. But for now, it’s all about AI’s future. Microsoft and Meta kicked off earnings last week, with both companies beating analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines. But dig deeper and the beats start to look less impressive. Microsoft reported cloud revenue of $40 billion in the quarter, shy of the $41.1 billion Wall Street was looking for. The company’s Intelligence Cloud platform, which includes Azure services, came up short too, posting revenue of $25.5 billion on expectations of $25.8 billion. Microsoft said part of the problem had to do with demand outpacing its available capacity for cloud services and that non-AI cloud services were lower than expected because it’s working to “balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth.” Despite that, AI services grew 157% year over year and contributed 13 percentage points of growth to Azure overall. “While investors wanted a more pronounced 2H [acceleration] from Azure, we continue to believe [Microsoft] is the predominant software AI winner,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note to investors. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood says cloud capacity should meet customers’ needs by the end of the company’s fiscal 2025. Meta, for its part, declined to provide full-year guidance for its fiscal 2025, but pointed to growth opportunities via its heavy AI investments. The company is planning to spend upwards of $65 billion building out its AI services this year, including launching its next-generation Llama 4 AI model. Meta also pushed back against fears that DeepSeek’s low-cost AI is a danger to its business, something Pivotal Research Group’s Jeffrey Wlodarczak agreed with in his investor note following the company’s earnings report. “We expect [Meta’s] open-source Llama AI to emulate the best of DeepSeek’s techniques, which should allow Llama to take the lead in AI given likely significantly lower costs than their peers for best-in-class AI products boosted materially by the fact it is US based and open-sourced which will attract developers,” Wlodarczak wrote. Google parent Alphabet’s stock plummeted Wednesday after coming up short on cloud revenue in the prior quarter. Like Microsoft, Google laid the blame on greater demand for its cloud services than is currently available. The fix? Spending $75 billion in 2025 on its AI build-out. That’s up from the $57.9 billion analysts were anticipating. The hope, among analysts and investors, is that those billions help even out Google’s supply and demand imbalance. “We continue to see a favorable risk/reward for Alphabet and think there is a case for multiple expansion in the coming quarters as investors gain more comfort related to infrastructure spending, regulatory risk, and the impact of generative AI on Google Search,” Wedbush’s Scott Devitt wrote in an investor note. Then there’s Apple, which like Microsoft and Meta, beat analysts’ expectations on earnings per share and revenue. But the company fell short of Wall Street’s anticipations on iPhone sales, reporting revenue of $69.1 billion on expectations of $71 billion. Apple’s Apple Intelligence AI platform was supposed to help buoy iPhone sales, but with the service only available in English, it’s missing out on a large portion of its user base, especially in China. The company says it will launch Apple Intelligence in more languages in the coming months. CEO Tim Cook also said iPhone sales performed better where Apple Intelligence is available, indicating that the platform is helping to drive upgrades, something that is sure to please investors if it holds true for other regions. Now Apple, like the rest of its Big Tech cohort, just needs to deliver on its AI promises. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: AMD stock plunges 10% despite beating sales expectations

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.66%) tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday morning, hitting a new 52-week low despite the semiconductor giant exceeding revenue expectations in its latest earnings report. The shares were trading at $108 each in the morning. In its fourth-quarter earnings report released Tuesday, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker posted mixed results. Net income was $482 million, down 28% from $667 million a year earlier. Gaming segment revenue dropped significantly, falling 59% year-over-year to $563 million. But revenue came in at $7.66 billion, exceeding the anticipated $7.53 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, slightly surpassing analysts’ expectations of $1.08. AMD projected total sales of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion for the current quarter, compared to analysts’ average estimate of $7.04 billion. Although AMD lags behind its rival Nvidia (NVDA+0.30%) in selling chips for data centers, its data center unit has become the company’s most crucial business segment. Recent growth has been driven by rising demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence. In the latest quarter, AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, marking a 69% year-over-year increase. “Data Center segment annual revenue nearly doubled as EPYC processor adoption accelerated and we delivered more than $5 billion of AMD Instinct accelerator revenue,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The company, which has been struggling with costs, reduced its global workforce by 4% in November 2024 in an attempt to focus on competing in the AI chip market. In January, AMD introduced new AI PC and gaming processors at the Consumer Electronics Show. The new Ryzen AI Max Series chips are designed for high-performance computing in “thin and light notebooks.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Buy This Cheap 6% Dividend As The S&P 500 Overheats

oil pumpjacks in silhouette at sunset, panoramic frame (XXXL) We are—unequivocally—bullish on the U.S. economy. We’re also big fans of the 6.1% dividend we’re going to discuss below, which trades for less than half its annual sales. That’s pretty much the opposite of the nosebleed 26 times sales (and 0.03% yield—not a typo) over at Nvidia (NVDA), even after last week’s panic over Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek. Fact is, it’s easy to be bullish on the U.S. these days, with the country’s economy leading (and in many cases lapping) those of other countries. The IMF, for example, sees the U.S. economy growing 2.7% in 2025, tops in the G7 and nearly triple the forecast 1% growth in the Eurozone. What’s more, the U.S. accounted for 26% of global GDP in 2024, according to Visual Capitalist. That’s despite the fact that we only account for a little over 4% of the world’s population. The productivity, dynamism and sheer power of the U.S. economy are marvels — and something we should all be proud of. But here’s the thing: The S&P 500’s valuation is overstretched (to say the least). The 2023 and 2024 bull runs have left the S&P 500 trading at a nosebleed 26 times earnings as I write this. The NASDAQ? A ridiculous 33 times. With numbers like that, you could be looking at a “lost decade” if you’re sitting in an index fund like the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Population growth won’t save us, either. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our numbers will grow just 0.6% a year on average from 2024 to 2034. Look out further and that figure drops sharply, to a mere 0.2% annually from 2045 to 2054. And we have tighter immigration policies coming. Not to mention tariffs, which threaten to slow economic growth and throttle up inflation. The point I’m making is that when it comes to stocks, those who sit in an index fund are in for a shock. The winners in the next decade will be those who make timely moves into (and out of) individual stocks. And if you focus on top-quality dividend stocks, you give yourself two extra advantages: Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a big believer in America. But we contrarian income investors always follow the data, and what it’s telling us is clear: Now is the time to diversify a little beyond America’s borders. It’s just the safe thing to do. Plus there are simply more global stocks in the bargain bin after this massive US-market run-up, like the 6.1%-yielder (with a growing payout) we’ll get into momentarily. Here’s another edge we have as U.S. investors: Because the U.S. market is so dynamic, everyone wants to list here. Which means we can buy big international dividend payers on the NYSE. Which brings me to the stock we’re going to delve into today: BP plc (BP), the British energy giant, a holding of my Contrarian Income Report advisory. BP yields 6.1%, trades on the NYSE and even pays dividends in U.S. funds. It’s the same as buying a U.S.-based producer like Exxon Mobil (XOM) but you’re getting a much higher dividend — XOM yields just 3.7%. Back to BP, whose mix we like better than that of XOM today, with its strong base in the US, through its presence in important shale areas, like the Permian and Eagle Ford. That’s complemented by offshore oil fields in places like its Clair oilfield, offshore Scotland and natural gas production facilities, like its LNG operation in Indonesia. BP has been around forever (more than a century), and like the old British Empire, the sun never sets on its 61-country operation. It was the first company to pull oil out of the ground in the Middle East (in 1908) and opened the first refinery in the region (in 1912). BP also deals in wind power, hydrogen and carbon capture; owns thousands of miles of pipelines; has commercial operations, such as convenience and retail fuel stations, Castrol lubricants and EV charging; trades oil, gas, and renewable and non-renewable power; and even has a bioenergy business. In other words, management has smartly positioned BP as a leader in the energy transition and in the fossil fuels that will still play an important role in the global economy for years to come. Which brings us back to that 6.1% dividend. The company cut its payout by 50% in 2020 and shares were chopped in half, as well. That’s the result of the “Dividend Magnet,” which long-time readers will recognize as the tendency for share prices to track dividend hikes (and cuts). Since then, though, the giant has recovered. Sales doubled between 2020 and 2023, and the firm is solidly profitable again. The “payout penance” continues for BP, with four hikes in the books since its infamous cut. This reminds us that CFOs are like carpenters — they measure twice and cut the dividend just once if they can help it. So far, so good. BP’s dividend sits 50% higher than after the cut. That’s still off its peak but trending positively. BP Dividend Magnet The fact that the British oil giant pays out just 36% of its last 12 months of free cash flow (FCF)—well below my 50% “safety limit”—is another indication that management got it right here. Even so, income scars (and memories of them) are slow to heal. BP trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings and 0.45-times trailing sales today. Contrast that with Exxon, which trades for 1.4-times sales and 14-times forward earnings. This sad pup will soon be readopted by income-hungry investors, especially if 10-year Treasury rates continue to keep bouncing off their “5% ceiling,” as I expect. That suggests long rates are high enough to keep inflation trending down—putting lower rates on the table in the future. All of this leaves us in a pretty sweet spot with BP: collecting a growing dividend set to pull the price higher, along with a 6.1% yield. And thanks to the stock’s bargain valuation, we’re getting some nice downside insulation here (always appreciated in the volatile oil business) and a shot at strong upside, too. And it’s all underpinned by the British giant’s exposure to the still-growing U.S. economy and the undervalued global one, too. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Holding the Wrong AI Crypto Could End in Disaster. Can Mind of Pepe Become a Winner in 2025?

Marc Chaikin is a legendary figure on Wall Street, renowned for spotting market trends before they unfold. His insights have accurately predicted major downturns, including the 2012 Priceline collapse, the COVID-19 market crash, and the recent banking crisis. When Chaikin speaks, Wall Street pays attention. This time, he’s sounding the alarm on the AI frenzy sweeping the U.S. stock market. According to Chaikin, investors holding the wrong AI stocks risk devastating financial losses. He stated, “If you’re holding Nvidia (NVDA) or FAANG right now, it’s time to prepare for a massive shift.” However, Chaikin believes there’s still a lot of money to be made in AI stocks, but only the right ones. Unlike before, picking a random trending stock won’t make you a millionaire. The markets are tough, and only accurate stock picking is the key to success. The demand for AI tech and products is growing by the minute. Companies like Palantir Technologies have benefited hugely from this. The stock is up by more than 60% since mid-January. This comes after a huge 340% increase in stock prices in 2024. This surge in prices is backed by a strong 36% year-on-year revenue growth, which now stands at $828M. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, credits the ‘untamed’ growth of demand in its AI software for the surge. The company now expects to increase revenue by another 54% in 2025. As you can see, picking the right AI stocks is the need of the hour. However, doing so can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Even then, the probability of the stock making you money is less, given the choppy waters in which AI stocks find themselves. This is where AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an autonomous AI agent that cuts through the information overload floating around about the crypto market and produces actionable insights through hive-mind analysis. What this means is that $MIND can interact with influencers and shape conversations and discussions on platforms like X. In the process, it forms a view of its own to produce triggers for all token holders. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this self-evolving AI agent helps investors identify early opportunities in the market by processing information in real time. The problem with crypto investing is that there’s too much information, all of which may or may not be factual. By the time a human can process this information barrage, the opportunity is long gone. $MIND, on the other hand, uses only real-time information (as fresh as a few seconds ago) to form a view of the markets. This adds to your trading efficiency by cutting down on data deviations. MIND of Pepe not only looks to take forward the legendary frog meme legacy but also adds real-time utility for all crypto investors. What would investors love more than regular early-opportunity investment ideas in a dicey AI stock market? Plus, $MIND developers have laid out a long-term vision for the project. Out of a total supply of 100B $MIND tokens, 30% has been reserved for innovation and AI agent updates, while 25% has been kept to support the AI agent ecosystem growth. Early $MIND investors can also earn 443% APY staking rewards – 15% of the token supply has been kept for staking and community incentives. No wonder experts believe $MIND can help investors make crazy gains in this bull run. The $MIND presale is currently live, with the project having already raised $5.1M so far. It’s, in fact, one of the best crypto presales going around right now. Available at a price of just $0.0032662 per token, the next price increase will happen in less than 2 days. This means this is the perfect time to buy the best AI agent coin. Simply visit the official $MIND presale page and connect your wallet. You can buy it with ETH, BNB, or USDT or use your card directly to complete the payment. However, it’s important to remember that crypto markets are subject to volatility and news-based risks. That’s why it is important to do your own research before making any purchases.

Title: Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Two market shocks less than three weeks into Trump's second presidential term have revived a playbook familiar to tech investors: "Buy the dip" is alive and kicking. Tariff fears sparked the latest rout Sunday evening, sending small-cap stock futures down 4% overnight — only to recover nearly all the losses by Tuesday close. Only a week before, "fears" of cheap AI from the likes of Chinese up-and-comer DeepSeek sent chip stocks crashing, led by AI poster child Nvidia (NVDA). On both occasions, investors not only bought the dip, but many bought it in the most aggressive way possible: with leverage. On Monday, Jan. 27, Nvidia suffered a 17% decline — its worst since the depths of the early pandemic in 2020. Yet, ETF strategist Todd Sohn, CMT of Strategas ETF Research, recently wrote in a note to clients that the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA ETF (NVDL) pulled in $1.6 billion singlehandedly last week. That product seeks to deliver twice the daily returns of the underlying Nvidia stock, which means that last Monday's 17% NVDA loss was inflated to 34% in the leveraged product. "It's a reflection that the 'buy the dip' mentality still exists for Tech," said Sohn. According to Vanda Research, during the height of the Nvidia washout, retail traders were funneling cash into the market at the highest rate since the November election period. "Mom-and-pop traders poured roughly [$4.25 billion] of new capital into US financial markets," said Vanda, measuring both ETF and single-stock flows over two market days. This "buy the dip" mentality isn't new, but it's become nearly reflexive. Years of easy money and rapid rebounds during the quantitative easing-driven years of global financial crisis recovery up through the COVID rebound conditioned a generation of traders. This mentality has a good chance of being tested again soon. (And maybe again, and again.) So far this year, markets have been sensitive to event risk, as the DeepSeek and tariff developments have shown. And with an active president in the first year of his term, stocks are already navigating a seasonally choppy stretch — one that tends to invite volatility even in calmer times. Factor in the sheer number of market-moving headlines, and even the most bullish strategists acknowledge turbulence ahead. As Tuesday's close underscored, this market may be sensitive, but the dip-buying optimism is unbowed.

Title: Wall St. Eyes 54% Upside in NVDA Stock as Options Traders Capitalize

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Despite China’s DeepSeek model disrupting the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the underlying hardware king. Therefore, the red ink imposed on NVDA stock would appear to be a discounted opportunity — an opinion shared by top analysts and investors. So, the argument isn’t about whether NVDA is an exciting bullish opportunity. Rather, the question is how best to capitalize on NVDA. Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio On a fundamental level, questions exist about the supposed ultra-low-cost nature of the DeepSeek algorithm. Further, the idea that China is about to launch an AI paradigm shift could be misleading. Major enterprises like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are supply-constrained regarding their AI hardware needs. According to reports, they want to significantly expand their capital expenditures to boost their machine-intelligence capabilities. The average price target of Wall Street analysts is $180 per share, which suggests around 54% upside to come. However, bullish investors can harness a particular options strategy to replicate big payouts over weeks, not years. I’m bullish on a rebound in NVDA stock and continue to believe it will deliver strong returns for shareholders. However, there is a cleaner way of gaining exposure to the tech/AI theme and NVDA stock while generating even more substantial returns than traditional stock investing. The first order of business is to recognize the short-term nature of options trading. Unlike the underlying security, options are classified as “wasting assets” because they all eventually expire worthless. Therefore, if you wager on so-called cheap options — or options far out the money — you effectively engage in binary transactions: you are either winning or losing. Moreover, the progression of time exponentially reduces the option’s premium value as it nears expiration, which tends to mean options traders think short-term. Therefore, focusing on optionable securities like NVDA isn’t about broader fundamentals but pricing behaviors based on statistical trends. Primarily, the key element that makes NVDA stock attractive to options traders is its upward bias. Statistically, when considering data over the trailing five years, traders who enter a position at the beginning of the week have a 56.98% chance of being profitable by the end of it. Over four weeks, the long odds improve to just over 66%. In other words, outside of a truly compelling reason to be contrarian, the numbers favor taking a shot on NVDA stock. However, the market operates with human emotions, and responses can vary depending on fluctuations in the fear-greed continuum. Last week, NVDA stock incurred a loss of 3.79%. Whenever NVDA loses up to 5% of value over one week, there’s a 67.53% chance that the equity will have landed in positive territory by the end of the fourth subsequent week. Stated differently, there’s evidence that investors tend to buy the dip during sizable declines (for the record, negative weeks over the past five years in NVDA carry a median loss of 3.7%). This framework provides all the more evidence that speculators are justified in wanting to buy Nvidia at a discount. Viewing Nvidia stock pricing data in no other context aside from the temporal — NVDA may reach $134.36 over the next four weeks, assuming the positive scenario materializes. If the negative scenario occurs, there is a statistical risk that NVDA could fall to $111.79, according to the options chain expiring Feb. 28. From a dynamic perspective, NVDA is on pace to hit $133.70 per share in an optimistic scenario or fall to $111.79 in an adverse scenario. With this market intelligence, investors can execute a bullish options strategy called the bull call spread. Under a bull spread, the trader buys a call option and simultaneously sells a call at a higher strike price (for the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call. To be sure, the sale of the short call necessarily caps the reward at the representative strike price. However, the benefit is that the net cash outlay to enter the bullish position is discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to breakeven, improving the speculator’s odds of success compared to a call-only acquisition. Now, the beauty of the bull spread comes in the form of the reward. If NVDA stock reaches $134, that’s a decent 11.6% return. However, if you only wager a thousand dollars on NVDA, the nominal reward would be $116. In contrast, the bull spread can offer far better rewards, depending on the specific transaction. One of the reasons why investors tend to shy away from multi-leg options strategies like the bull call spread is due to the plethora of available spreads. How does one know which spread to pick? Let me tell you a little secret: it’s just like soccer. In the beautiful game, you improve your scoring chances by committing more players to the attack. At the same time, you leave yourself vulnerable to a counterattack. If you’re worried about conceding a goal, you can take speculative long shots without committing too many players to the attack, although the chances of success are low. In the options arena, the 111/134 bull call spread (buy the $111 call, sell the $134 call) for the options chain expiring Feb. 28 would be an example of a high-commitment attack. As of Monday’s close, the net debit required stood at $895 for the chance to earn $1,405 (a payout of 156.98%). So long as NVDA stock doesn’t drop below $111 by Feb. 28, traders may be able to salvage some intrinsic value out of the long call. However, if Nvidia implodes (i.e., the market’s devastating counterattack), the trader will lose the entire net debit paid to enter the trade. On the other hand, you can select the 132/134 bull spread. This trade only requires a $60 cash outlay for the chance to earn $140, or a payout of 233.33%. However, NVDA stock must reach $134 just to break even. Since both the long and short calls are well out of the money, there’s a strong chance you will lose the entire net debit paid. Still, it may be worthwhile to take that potshot because NVDA stock has such a strong upward bias. Turning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA price target is $179.81 per share, implying a 54.13% upside potential. Currently, NVDA may just be the most Buy-rated stock in the U.S. NVDA stock took a hit last week due to concerns over China’s DeepSeek AI model, but the selloff could be an opportunity in disguise. Despite the noise, NVDA remains the dominant tech hardware player, and history suggests investors tend to buy the dip. The numbers support a bullish outlook, with statistical trends pointing to a likely rebound in the coming weeks. Rather than simply following Wall St guidance and buying stock outright, options traders can take advantage of NVDA’s upside potential through a bull call spread. This approach leverages the stock’s upward bias while limiting risk. Depending on the chosen strike prices, traders can position themselves for a substantial payout if NVDA trades higher. Ultimately, it’s about structuring the trade like a calculated offensive play—balancing risk and reward based on market probabilities. Disclosure. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.
