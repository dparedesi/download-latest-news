Title: The Trump administration is delaying a 25% tariff on Chinese-made graphics cards

Graphics cards and motherboards assembled in China are avoiding President Donald Trump’s import taxes, for now. In a three-page notice published Saturday in the Federal Register, the Office of the Trade Representative said it was “appropriate” to extend a moratorium that won’t subject vendors of electronics equipment to tariffs on graphics cards and graphics processing units. The measure stems from a long-running Section 301 investigation into Chinese economic policies and whether they are harming American companies. That federal probe started under the first Trump administration, and it would apply a 25% tariff if officials conclude that Chinese companies had an unfair advantage. The 25% tariff has been inactive due to a string of reprieves from both the Biden and Trump administrations. China remains the world’s largest electronics manufacturer, according to the International Trade Centre; the nation is still subject to a minimum 30% import tax by the Trump administration, barring some exemptions. Major tech companies including Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) were spared the brunt of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs in April. A federal court battle is now brewing over the fate of those tariffs. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Staged a Blistering May Rally. What's Next?

The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.

Title: Market Implications Of Tariff Litigation And AI Spending

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial ... More sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. Market volatility and recent trade developments have created distinct opportunities across multiple sectors, from artificial intelligence powerhouses to healthcare giants navigating regulatory changes. Savvy investors are recognizing that current market dislocations often mask underlying business strength, particularly among companies with proven track records of innovation, market leadership and adaptability to changing economic conditions. This analysis identifies five compelling investment opportunities spanning technology, healthcare, industrials and data analytics sectors. Each selection represents companies well-positioned to benefit from long-term secular trends, trading at levels that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors with suitable time horizons and risk tolerance. The selection process emphasized companies demonstrating strong competitive moats, consistent revenue growth and clear catalysts for future expansion. Priority was given to market leaders within their respective industries, particularly those benefiting from transformative trends such as the adoption of artificial intelligence, healthcare innovation, industrial automation, and data-driven decision-making across enterprise markets. Each company needed to show resilient business models capable of generating sustainable cash flows while investing in growth initiatives. Special consideration was given to management teams with proven execution capabilities, strong balance sheets that provide strategic flexibility and business models positioned to benefit from ongoing technological and demographic shifts reshaping the global economy. Honeywell International stands as a premier diversified technology and manufacturing company, operating across aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and safety solutions. The company has successfully transformed itself into a software-enabled industrial leader, developing connected solutions that address critical challenges in automation, energy efficiency and digital transformation. Recent strategic initiatives focus on sustainable technologies, including renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions and next-generation automation systems. The company's diversified portfolio provides natural hedging against industry-specific downturns while positioning it to benefit from multiple long-term growth drivers. Honeywell's aerospace division serves both commercial and defense markets. At the same time, its building technologies segment capitalizes on increasing demand for innovative building solutions and energy management systems that reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Honeywell represents exceptional value in the industrial technology space, combining steady dividend income with significant growth potential from emerging technologies. The company's transformation toward higher-margin software and services has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Operating margins have expanded to over 20%, with return on invested capital consistently above 15%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation and strong pricing power. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple business segments as commercial aviation continues normalizing and defense spending remains robust globally. Honeywell’s Aerospace division contributed nearly 40% of total revenue in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow further as backlogs normalize and global air travel rebounds. The Building Technologies division positions Honeywell perfectly for the ongoing shift toward smart infrastructure and energy-efficient solutions, particularly as regulatory requirements drive the adoption of automated building management systems. This segment also supports a recurring revenue model through service contracts and software subscriptions, contributing to earnings stability. Management's consistent operational execution, combined with strategic investments in breakthrough technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and quantum computing applications, creates multiple pathways for long-term value creation while maintaining attractive current income through reliable dividend payments. With a payout ratio under 50% and consistent dividend increases, Honeywell remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation. NVIDIA Corporation has emerged as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence computing, providing the essential hardware and software infrastructure powering the global AI revolution. The company's graphics processing units form the foundation for machine learning, data center acceleration, autonomous vehicle development and scientific computing applications across virtually every industry. Recent strategic partnerships, including collaborations with major technology companies and governments, demonstrate the critical nature of NVIDIA's technology in next-generation computing applications. The company's comprehensive AI platform extends beyond hardware to encompass software frameworks, development tools and cloud services, fostering long-term customer relationships and generating recurring revenue streams. NVIDIA's data center business has become the primary driver of growth. At the same time, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive segments provide diversification and additional expansion opportunities as AI capabilities are integrated across more applications. NVIDIA occupies a virtually unassailable position in one of the most transformative technology trends of this generation, with artificial intelligence adoption still in its early stages across most industries. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Saudi Arabia on AI initiatives, demonstrate the global strategic importance of NVIDIA's technology and provide new revenue opportunities in emerging markets seeking to build AI capabilities. The company's technological moat continues widening as competitors struggle to match NVIDIA's integrated hardware-software approach and extensive developer ecosystem. Gross margins remain strong, above 70%, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing in a high-demand market. While the stock trades at premium valuations, the massive addressable market for AI computing, combined with NVIDIA's dominant market share and accelerating adoption rates across enterprise and government sectors, justifies higher multiples. The company's ability to maintain pricing power while scaling production positions it for sustained revenue and margin expansion as AI infrastructure investments accelerate globally. UnitedHealth Group operates as America's largest healthcare company, serving over 50 million members through its UnitedHealthcare insurance business while providing comprehensive health services through its rapidly growing Optum division. The company has built an integrated healthcare ecosystem that combines insurance, pharmacy benefits, medical care delivery and health technology solutions, improving patient outcomes while reducing overall system costs. Despite recent stock volatility related to regulatory concerns, UnitedHealth's fundamental business model remains strong, benefiting from aging demographics, increasing healthcare utilization and the ongoing shift toward value-based care arrangements. The Optum division has become a significant growth driver, providing technology-enabled services that help healthcare providers improve efficiency and patient care quality. UnitedHealth's current valuation appears compelling given its dominant market position and multiple growth drivers across both insurance and services businesses. The recent regulatory-driven volatility, exacerbated by a high-profile fraud lawsuit, has led to a steep selloff, pushing the stock down significantly and compressing its valuation to a forward P/E of just 12. For a company with UnitedHealth’s scale, diversified revenue streams and consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past decade, this represents a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a deep discount. The company's integrated model provides competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Healthcare spending continues growing faster than GDP, driven by demographic trends and medical innovation, creating a favorable operating environment. The company's investment in technology and data analytics capabilities positions it well for the ongoing transformation toward personalized medicine and value-based care delivery models. Optum's expansion into new markets and services provides significant revenue diversification beyond traditional insurance operations, while the company's strong balance sheet enables continued strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. The combination of defensive healthcare exposure and growth potential makes UnitedHealth attractive despite near-term legal and regulatory headwinds. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare companies, combining leading pharmaceutical research with innovative medical devices and trusted consumer health products. The company's pharmaceutical division develops breakthrough treatments for cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions, while its medical device business serves the global surgical, orthopedic, and vision care markets. The company has demonstrated remarkable consistency over decades, generating steady cash flows that support continuous research investment and regular dividend increases spanning over 60 years. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding oncology and immunology portfolios through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, while divesting non-core consumer brands to focus on higher-growth healthcare segments with stronger competitive positioning. Johnson & Johnson offers exceptional stability combined with growth potential from its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and medical device innovations. The company's diversified revenue streams provide resilience during economic uncertainty. At the same time, its strong research capabilities and established regulatory relationships enable the successful development of breakthrough treatments that command premium pricing and market share. The pharmaceutical division's focus on high-value therapeutic areas, such as oncology and immunology, aligns with some of healthcare's fastest-growing segments—meanwhile, the medical device business benefits from aging demographics and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Management's disciplined capital allocation, combined with the company's AAA credit rating and commitment to dividend growth, makes Johnson & Johnson particularly attractive for conservative investors seeking reliable income growth, capital preservation and upside potential from medical innovation. Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics platforms that enable organizations to integrate, analyze and act upon massive datasets for critical decision-making. The company serves both government and commercial clients through its Gotham platform for defense and intelligence applications and Foundry platform for enterprise customers across industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and financial services. The company's software enables customers to uncover hidden patterns in complex data, optimize operations and make data-driven decisions that were previously impossible due to technological limitations. Recent commercial expansion has accelerated as enterprises recognize the competitive advantages provided by advanced analytics capabilities. At the same time, government contracts continue providing a stable revenue foundation and development funding for cutting-edge capabilities. Palantir operates at the intersection of several powerful trends, including the adoption of artificial intelligence, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making across both government and enterprise markets. The stock's strong 2025 performance reflects growing recognition of the company's unique capabilities and expanding market opportunities as organizations prioritize analytics investments to maintain competitive advantages. The company's government relationships provide both revenue stability and access to cutting-edge use cases that drive product development, while commercial market expansion offers significant scalability potential. Palantir's software platforms create high switching costs once implemented, leading to strong customer retention and expanding usage over time. The increasing importance of data analytics across all industries, combined with Palantir's proven ability to handle complex, mission-critical applications, positions the company for sustained growth as digital transformation accelerates across both public and private sectors. Bottom Line These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. From NVIDIA's AI dominance to Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability, UnitedHealth's integrated model and ultra cheap valuation due to regulatory risks, Honeywell's industrial innovation, and Palantir's data analytics leadership, investors gain exposure to multiple growth drivers while balancing risk across different market segments and business models.

Title: Nvidia can't be stopped, Apple falls behind, and the AI data center race: Tech news roundup

2 / 11 When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. Read More 3 / 11 The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. Read More 4 / 11 Nvidia (NVDA) continues to go beyond expectations — even if things are a little more complicated this time around. Its strong first-quarter headline numbers show that Nvidia’s AI thesis is as strong as ever and that its margins remain elite, despite facing significant headwinds due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 processors to China and other geopolitical concerns.

On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter.

Title: BI Investor of the Month: Meet the fund manager up 28% over the last year

Time Published: 2025-05-31T08:46:01Z
Full Content:
Ankur Crawford, manager of the Alger Concentrated Equity ETF (CNEQ), is BI's Investor of the Month for May. Crawford's growth fund launched in April 2024 and has burst onto the scene. Over the last 12 months, it's up 30%, which was good enough to beat 96% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. The S&P 500, by comparison, has returned 12% in that time. In May alone, CNEQ rose 17%. Crawford said the fund, which has 30 holdings, focuses on finding companies with little to no competition and, therefore, the ability to keep prices and profits high. "I would say 50% of the portfolio would liken itself to being an oligopoly or a monopoly," she said. "A great example of that is we own Ferrari. There's only one Ferrari, and they can raise prices however much they want; they are still sold out for three years." Thematically, Crawford said the fund is betting big on artificial intelligence, which she called "one of the biggest opportunities that we see, probably of our generation." Despite sparking a market frenzy since late 2022, the AI trade is still in its early days, she said, and likely has legs for another 5-10 years. "It is a game-changing technology that is still in its infancy," she said. "What it will do to companies that furnish it and companies that are part of building out the infrastructure is significant." The top holdings in CNEQ reflect Crawford's affinity for AI: Nvidia (NVDA) has a 13.18% weighting, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at 10.06%, Amazon (AMZN) at 9.27%, and Meta Platforms (META) at 6.1%. Crawford highlighted two companies in particular as leading the AI trade going forward, and that also fit her preference for monopoly or oligopoly firms: graphic processing unit maker Nvidia and semiconductor producer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). While both have high valuations, they also have pricing power that's just about unmatched. "Being the only player in the world that can do something so important, I would argue TSM is probably the most strategic business on this planet," Crawford said. "That comes with a lot of rewards, including pricing power." Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis.

Title: Nvidia, Other Chip Stocks Slide Amid Worries About US-China Trade Tensions

Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks slid Friday amid worries about worsening U.S.-China trade tensions. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 4% in recent trading. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) also lost ground, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropping about 3%. Some of Nvidia's partners, including server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), saw their stocks fall as well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) President Trump on Friday said China has "totally violated its agreement with us," dampening hopes the countries would soon come to a longer-term agreement after reaching a temporary truce earlier this month. Separately, Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump plans to expand U.S. companies' licensing requirements to make deals with Chinese companies that have ties to sanctioned firms. The development comes after the Trump administration moved earlier this month to rescind the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that would have further curbed sales of American AI hardware to a broader group of countries, but warned it's looking to replace the rule with new restrictions. Analysts at Citi and Deutsche Bank warned at the time that they could turn out to be stricter than Biden's. During Nvidia's earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said it's "terrific" that Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule, but criticized the administration's other moves to limit its sales to China, saying that "shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position." The AI chipmaker took a $4.5 billion charge in its fiscal first quarter associated with new export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China, and said it expects to take an $8 billion hit in the current quarter due to lost revenue.
