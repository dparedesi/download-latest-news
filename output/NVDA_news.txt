Since bursting into the A.I. scene five years ago, the Canadian startup Cohere has emerged as a rival to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Backed by tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Salesforce, it’s managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster its mission to develop A.I. models for enterprises. Cohere’s partners include software giant Oracle, Japanese telecom company Fujitsu and, as first reported by TechCrunch this week, the data analytics company Palantir. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Founded more than two decades ago by Peter Thiel, Palantir provides data analytics software for major businesses and government agencies. While Cohere has yet to officially announce the partnership, a segment during Palantir’s developer conference in November detailed its work with the startup, which has already seen Cohere’s models deployed to Palantir customers. Cohere and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. Cohere’s partnership with Palantir appears to focus on Palantir’s Foundry platform, which serves corporate clients. Billy Trend, a senior software engineer at Cohere, noted his excitement “about working with Palantir” during the conference. He discussed the startup’s engagement with an unnamed Palantir customer who had “strict constraints” on data storage and was looking to conduct its inference in Arabic—a task Trend described as “a great opportunity” for Cohere’s multilingual capabilities. Headquartered in Toronto and San Francisco, Cohere was established in 2019 by former Google researchers Nick Frosst, Ivan Zhang and Aiden Gomez. Gomez notably co-authored the 2017 “Attention is All You Need Paper,” which led to pivotal breakthroughs in machine learning. Instead of pushing consumer products or advancements in artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.) research like its competitors, Cohere has positioned itself as a startup focused on building tailored models for enterprise clients like McKinsey and Deloitte. Its low-profile strategy has attracted the attention of corporate investors like Cisco, AMD and Fujitsu, all of whom participated in a $500 million funding round in July that valued the startup at $5.5 billion—more than doubling its previous valuation of $2.1 billion a year earlier. Other backers of Cohere include renowned A.I. academics Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li. Some of Cohere’s largest competitors have becoming increasingly cozy with defense clients in recent months. In November, Palantir announced plans to team up with Anthropic and Amazon (AMZN) in a partnership that will provide Anthropic’s A.I. models to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Earlier this month, OpenAI inked a military deal with the defense company Anduril that will see its technology infused into anti-drone systems. Between August of 2022 and 2023, the value of A.I.-related federal contracts soared 150 percent to a staggering $675 million, according to a study from the Brookings Institute.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indices declined sharply after the Federal Open Market Committee announced a quarter percentage point reduction in interest rates on Wednesday afternoon and just two more interest rate cuts in 2025. With that, the Dow had its first ten-day losing streak, the longest since 1974. In its final interest rate decision of the year, the Fed implemented its third consecutive cut, bringing the interest rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. “Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,” the FOMC said in a statement. “Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.” The central bank indicated that it could carry out just two more reductions to the federal funds rate in 2025, given quarter-point cuts, according to its updated Summary of Economic Projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell similarly signaled that the Fed will take a “more cautious” approach to monetary policy next year. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a press conference Wednesday. “And as long as the economy in the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Powell said that the decision to cut rates was a “closer call” than previous reductions, but that the FOMC ultimately decided it was “the right call” to balance inflation and labor market goals. After the market closed, the Dow was down over 1,100 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Moreover, Nvidia (NVDA+2.50%) stock, which declined earlier this week, bounced back on Wednesday. Micron Technology (MU-16.89% is set to announce its quarterly results after the closing bell. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA has reigned uncontested over the AI chip sphere for far too long. However, now it seems that some much-needed competition is finally putting up a challenge to the GPU manufacturer's full-spectrum dominance over this critical arena. OMDIA: $GOOGL'S TPU DEMAND GROWS, CHALLENGING $NVDA'S AI CHIP DOMINANCE Omdia research shows surging demand for Google's TPU chips, with estimates suggesting they could account for $6B–$9B in Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue this year. At even $6B, TPU shipments are growing… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 To wit, Omdia Research has now published its fresh take on the dynamics within the AI chip sphere, noting that Goggle's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could account for between $6 billion and $9 billion in AI-related sales for Broadcom this year. As a refresher, Broadcom is currently developing custom AI chips (ASICs) for three major customers: Google, Meta, and ByteDance. The company is also developing next-gen AIXPUs with two other clients. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, many cloud providers have begun preferring custom chips or ASICs over NVIDIA's GPUs due to the former's cost advantage over the latter, which enables cost-effective optimization of internal workloads. As per Morgan Stanley's estimates, the custom AI chip market - driven primarily by cloud providers - will grow from $120 billion in 2024 to $300 billion by 2027, outpacing the growth rate for the GPU market. Coming back, Omdia believes that even if Broadcom's TPU shipments for 2024 ultimately clock-in at $6 billion, which constitutes the low-end of the research firm's estimated range, they would still be significant enough to dent NVIDIA's AI chip market share! Looking ahead, Omdia continues to see TPU-powered AI products driving broad-based growth for Google Cloud. $NVDA +2.75% [Microsoft bought twice as many of Nvidia’s flagship chips as any of its largest rivals in the U.S. and China this year, per FT.

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell chip could push the company into a new stratosphere as the AI revolution continues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

Title: Why the Dow is suddenly in a historic funk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on its worst losing streak in nearly 50 years. The major index has fallen for nine straight trading days, its largest stretch of consecutive declines since 1978. The move lower in the Dow comes as large-cap tech has largely been holding up the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) throughout December. The Dow's losses amount to roughly 3%, or more than 1,500 points, in the past nine trading sessions. The index has fallen from a record close of 45,014 on Dec. 4 to 43,499 as of Tuesday's close. In that same time frame, the S&P 500 is down about 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up almost 2%. Given the Dow's construction, it's not benefitting from the tech rally. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, just four — Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. This means the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, hasn't benefitted from massive rallies in Tesla (TSLA), which is up more than 37% in the past 10 days, or Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), which has risen 14% in the same time period. Instead, the Dow has been pulled down, partly due to the recent sell-off in Nvidia stock. The blue-chip index added Nvidia on Nov. 8. Since then, one of the hottest stocks in the market has cooled off, with shares down nearly 12%. "It's really the tech leadership versus everything else, value versus growth," WisdomTree global chief investment officer Jeremy Schwartz told Yahoo Finance. A sell-off in healthcare stocks has also weighed on the Dow. UnitedHealth (UNH) is down about 20% in the past 10 days following the murder of its CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4. Other healthcare stocks have also lagged, with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN) both down more than 4% in the past 10 trading sessions. Schwartz said the Dow's decline hasn't been surprising given the run-up in stocks this year, though. "We are still optimistic for next year. We think stocks versus bonds is still [the place] to be in the markets," he said. "But there was so much strong positioning for this rally and for this seasonal rally that it's not actually a surprise to see this pullback." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the session down roughly 0.6%, registering its ninth straight day of losses. The last 9-day losing streak for the Dow was Feb. 1978. Prior to that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. The other major indexes dropped in tandem on Tuesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) losing about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Fed policymakers kicked off their final gathering of the year earlier in the trading day, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares closed down over 1%. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Prices retreated to just above $106,500 a coin. US stocks closed down across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index fell roughly 0.6% to register its ninth straight day of losses. The last time that happened was February 1978. The other major indexes also finished the session lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. December’s market action has been all about a rally from several members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) all hit fresh record highs on Monday. Even on a day like Tuesday, where all three major indexes were in the red, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) hit a record high. While each individual stock has its own potential story working for it — like Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ties with Donald Trump sparking a post-election rally — market strategists believe there is also a broader theme at play: The Magnificent Seven have become a place to hide when the direction of the macro narrative becomes uncertain. "When you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a 'defensive,'" Citi head of us equity strategy Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. The large-cap bias among investors has come as markets have moved to expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than previously anticipated over the next year amid signs of sticky inflation and solid economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on pace for its longest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index slid about 0.8% by afternoon trade on Tuesday, coming off an eighth straight day of losses. The last nine-day losing streak for the Dow was February 1978. Before that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the biggest loser within the Dow, falling over 3%. Goldman Sachs (GS), Salesforce (CRM), and Nvidia (NVDA) followed, each down about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock recovered from earlier losses but still traded down over 1% Tuesday as investors grew cautious the AI spending that fueled its rise could ease or spread to rivals. Shares of the AI chipmaker have fallen over 10% since reaching a record closing high of $148.88 in early November. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia made a swift ascent to the top, from a graphics card company primarily used for video games to the world’s leading supplier of AI chips, as Big Tech goes all-in on generative artificial intelligence. In 2024, it traded places with Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company, and in early November, it replaced the once-dominant Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note last week he expects Nvidia’s market cap to surpass $4 trillion in 2025. But following its record close in November, Nvidia shares began to fall after commentary from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. Rumors of overheating issues with its latest Blackwell AI servers stoked fears of further delays to the production ramp-up, sending shares down even more. Even Nvidia’s most recent blowout earnings report, which surpassed bullish analysts’ already-high expectations, did little to help the stock's trajectory. Adding to Nvidia’s troubles, China’s competition authority last week said it has launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia’s $7 billion acquisition of networking technology company Mellanox. Meanwhile, the competition is heating up, with companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Broadcom (AVGO) developing and rolling out their own respective chips. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices surged to another record on Tuesday, briefly touching above $108,000 early Tuesday before retreating to just around $107,000 by mid-afternoon. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has enjoyed a sizable rally following Donald Trump's presidential win, rising over 50% since that time. Trump's win pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs in the immediate aftermath of the election, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who announced he would step down on Jan. 20. Despite bitcoin's moves to the upside on Tuesday, other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names moved lower. Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell about 1% to trade above $3,900 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, dropped around 4%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, saw shares fall roughly 1%. Bank of America's latest fund manager's survey could be summed in up three words from BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett: "super-bullish sentiment." Respondents are bullish about US stocks, flashing the largest percentage of respondents overweight US equities on record. They're bullish about equities in general, with global risk appetite at a three-year high and investors' allocation to cash sitting at a three-year low. And they're increasingly bullish that the global economy won't enter recession in 2025. Just 6% of respondents said they see a "hard landing" — where higher rates help tip the economy into an outright downturn — in the next 12 months. This marked the lowest number of respondents to call for a hard landing in six months. This reflects the broad consensus on Wall Street that, at least in the US, above-trend growth is largely expected in 2025. But as we wrote in Tuesday's Morning Brief, when everyone's on one side of an argument, it often raises eyebrows from strategists and economists. "My concern dial has gone up a little bit," Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning. "Two years ago, back in 2022, I recall the consensus was largely on the recession train for the coming year (I took the other side) even though labor markets were fine and homebuilding stocks were outperforming despite rate hikes. "Today, the consensus is fairly sanguine on growth next year. However, labor markets have been cooling and homebuilding stocks are presently underperforming despite rate cuts. I see myself on the more cautious side of the consensus at present." Telsa (TSLA) — now less than $100 billion away from eclipsing the market cap of Facebook owner Meta (META) — continued to enjoy a massive rally on Tuesday. Shares of the EV maker rose as much as 4.5%, boosting its market cap to around $1.54 trillion. The uptick in the stock price comes after Mizuho upgraded the company to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $515 a share, up from the prior $230. The firm cited a looser regulatory framework as a tailwind for shares in 2025 following Donald Trump's presidential win. Musk, a close ally of Trump, will co-head the new "Department of Government Efficiency" in the president-elect's second term. Meta, which has a market cap of about $1.57 trillion, fell nearly 1% in late morning trade. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade before bouncing off of its session lows. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade," per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said.

Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement. “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz wrote, "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest rate cut.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Tuesday despite upbeat retail sales data as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting expected to usher in an interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.7%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Markets are waiting for Fed policymakers to kick off their final gathering of the year, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares fell over 2% in late morning trade. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade" per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Title: Nvidia stock slumps into a correction — while Broadcom basks in its own 'Nvidia moment'

Nvidia (NVDA+2.50%) stock is in correction territory, and rival chipmaker Broadcom’s (AVGO-0.90%) late-year boost took a hit Tuesday morning. Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA+0.52%). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: AMD Is Pouring Cash Into A.I. Startups: Companies It Has Backed So Far

AMD (AMD), a Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker that has benefited generously from the A.I. boom, is pouring some of its newfound cash into generative A.I. startups. AMD’s newest A.I. bet is on Liquid AI, a startup established last year by MIT researchers that aims to create cost-effective A.I. models. The chipmaker’s investment arm led the startup’s recent $250 million funding round, which included investors like OSS Capital and Duke Capital Partners and reportedly values the startup at more than $2 billion. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Unlike the traditional neural networks underpinning A.I. systems, which model the human brain, Liquid AI is focused on a new type of A.I. model that takes inspiration from the smaller brains of worms and requires significantly less compute and energy. “Liquid AI’s unique approach to developing efficient AI models will push the boundaries of A.I., making it far more accessible,” said Mathew Hein, chief strategy officer of corporate development at AMD, in a statement. The Liquid AI investment marks the ninth A.I. bet placed by AMD Ventures in 2024 alone, according to data from Crunchbase. And it isn’t just the chipmaker’s venture division that has been ramping up its work with startups. Of the 12 investments by AMD since 2000, half were made in the past four years. “We’ve decided to become much more active in how we’re working on this,” said Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, during a recent podcast interview. In light of A.I.’s rapid advancement, even large enterprises that were previously “more conservative with working with startups are also becoming much more open,” added Su. “Nobody wants to be behind in A.I.” Earlier this month, AMD Ventures participated in a $155 million funding round for Ayar Labs, a startup developing A.I. chips that transmit data to each other with light. Other investments made in 2024 benefited the likes of Cohere, a Canadian startup specializing in A.I. models for enterprises, and the data-labeling Scale AI. In September, AMD became one of the backers behind World Labs, a venture established by acclaimed A.I. academic Fei-Fei Li that aims to create A.I. models able to navigate and reason with the 3D world. AMD company-wide investments, meanwhile, have focused on A.I.-centered companies like the GPU cloud platform TensorWave and the model provider Fireworks AI. Last year, the chipmaker backed Hugging Face, an open-source A.I. developer platform, in a $235 million round that valued the company at $4.5 billion. AMD isn’t the only chipmaker moonlighting as a major A.I. investor. Nvidia (NVDA), too, has demonstrated a growing appetite for venture capital in recent years; having also partaken in fundraising rounds for Hugging Face, Cohere and Scale AI. The value of its A.I. bets reportedly totaled $1.5 billion at the beginning of 2024—a sharp jump from just $300 million the year prior.

Title: Why the rally in chip stocks could broaden beyond AI in 2025, according to BofA

Chip stocks will continue to get a boost from artificial intelligence enthusiasm next year but other trends will emerge to help drive semiconductor shares higher later in the year, Bank of America said. The bank's analysts, led by Vivek Arya, say AI chip stocks will continue to surge before the rally broadens toward less-crowded auto and industrial chipmaker stocks in the second half of 2025. "We see 2025 as a year of two different trends," the analysts said in a note on Monday. In the first half of the year, they see AI semiconductor stocks sustaining strong momentum as excitement continues to build and Nvidia rolls out its new Blackwell GPU. The chip giant's next-gen Blackwell chip has been highly anticipated given its increase in power over the company's current Hopper chip, as companies look for increasingly powerful tools to train and run AI models. The analysts say the strong demand for the chips from US cloud customers like Google and Meta should help the rally sustain momentum, though delivery uncertainties for the chips are a lingering risk after initial shipment delays. "We expect the AI investments driven by AI training and scaling of models to continue, doubling down on the NVDA Blackwell deployment ramps driven by cloud customers," they said. In the second half of the year, though, the analysts see investor interest shifting as AI stocks potentially peak amid concerns about returns on heavy investments by companies in the space. "In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25," the analysts said. "AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon." They say sentiment could shift toward auto and industrial chipmaker stocks as a global economic recovery replenishes inventory and boosts auto production. "In the second half, we expect a pickup in auto/industrial semis as customer/channel inventories normalize (replenishment + easy comps), as well as a pick-up in global auto production," the analysts said. The shift would mark a broadening in the semiconductor rally, which has seen the sector over 30% so far this year as AI chipmakers like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor surge. The analysts see semiconductors maintaining their strong momentum to boost sales by 15% to $725 billion in 2025, marking a slight slowdown from a 20% rise expected for the full year in 2024.

getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Stephen Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities.

To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA is ending 2024 on a historically strong footing, and 2025 might turn out to be equally auspicious provided that the GPU maker is able to deliver on Wall Street's lofty expectations. Today, Truist Securities raised the proverbial bar on the expectations count by incorporating a whole new product segment within its stock price target computations for NVIDIA. NVIDIA $NVDA price-target raised to $204 (from $169) at Truist Securities, implying +54% upside. Analyst Will Stein expects Nvidia to announce a client-side CPU in 2025, which would unlock an additional $35 billion in TAM: "Incrementally constructive on AI dominance & client… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) December 16, 2024 Truist Securities analyst, Will Stein, dropped a bombshell today by pegging expectations of an entirely new product segment to NVIDIA's 2025 projections: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." The analyst remains "incrementally constructive on [NVIDIA's] AI dominance & client CPU," while noting that the stock has proven to be a "home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand." Stein expects 2025 to be another "constructive" year for NVIDIA due to the opening up of its CPU-related TAM and continuing market dominance via its full technology stack: "All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack (not just chips...or servers...or even server racks...but especially software and pre-trained models)." Accordingly, the analyst has raised his price target for NVIDIA shares from $169 to $204, implying a ~54 percent upside potential relative to the current price level. Meanwhile, as we recently reported, NVIDIA's next-gen "Blackwell Ultra" GB300 AI servers are expected to debut by mid-2025. Despite suffering initial setbacks from several minor design flaws, NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is slated for significant expansion in 2025, as per the trend that can be gleaned from the GPU manufacturer's supply chain partners. This dovetails with recent reports that suggest ongoing discussions between NVIDIA and TSMC to manufacture Blackwell GPUs in the latter's Arizona facilities. Bear in mind that the outgoing Biden administration recently awarded TSMC $6.6 billion in new funding to incentivize its production facilities in Arizona, where commercial activities are currently slated to commence in the first half of 2025.

Investing.com -- Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL). “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and electric vehicle (EV) leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CDNS) is noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year. The report also includes rating changes for smaller mid-cap stocks. Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS) has been upgraded to Buy from Neutral, and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has been raised to Neutral from Underperform due to expected growth acceleration. On the other hand, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral, with analysts citing a “lack of catalysts.” Moreover, BofA recognizes the potential in small to mid-cap stocks such as Coherent (NYSE:COHR), MACOM Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:MTSI), and Ceragon Networks (NASDAQ:CRNT), especially as growth extends to networking and optics sectors beyond just computing. “Despite the crowded nature of AI stocks, we still see a continued “arms-race” between cloud service providers, TAM expansion into enterprise on-premises and sovereign deployments, and continued pace of innovation in training and inference (agentic AI),” analysts continued. “However, AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon.”

Title: What's ahead for the markets in 2025, according to experts

U.S. stocks rose in 2024, fueled by the unprecedented surge of artificial intelligence — a revolutionary technology that has driven investor sentiment. Inflation also eased after a couple of years of persistent price pressure, allowing the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates. The results of the presidential election provided an additional boost, propelling the Dow and other major stock indexes to record highs and setting the stage for 2025. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, certain sectors and stocks are expected to see significant shifts. Here’s what analysts and experts expect. The S&P 500 was hovering above 6,000 in mid-December. Major banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have forecast that the benchmark index will reach 6,500 in 2025. The optimism is supported by confidence in ongoing earnings growth and a favorable monetary policy environment, key drivers of market performance. Eric Schiffer, chairman of the Los Angeles-based investment firm The Patriarch Organization, told Quartz in an email that he expects the S&P to reach 6,750 by the end of next year, with the Dow at 49,500 and Nasdaq at 22,100. (The Dow was at about 44,000 in mid-December, and the Nasdaq at about 20,000.) Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors has a similar forecast, expecting the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of 2025. In a more optimistic scenario, he anticipates the index could climb as high as 7,000. Paula Murphy, a senior vice president and director of portfolio management at the bank Rockland Trust, said financial firms stand to gain the most from the reduced regulation, corporate tax cuts, and lower capital requirements expected under Trump. That could drive an acceleration of loan growth and an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity for banks. Murphy said energy companies may also see new gains under the new administration. “Energy companies may also benefit from potential deregulation, as well as policy shifts to further boost domestic oil and natural gas production,” Murphy said in an email. She noted that potential sanctions on oil-exporting countries could tighten global supply, leading to higher prices. As China continues to be the world’s leading exporter of goods and the United States its largest importer — bringing in approximately $427 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2023 — these dynamics may have significant implications, Murphy said. “Inflationary pressures stemming from tougher trade with China may lead to volatility in sectors dependent on global supply chains,” she said. And restrictive immigration policies under Trump may reduce U.S. labor supply, Murphy said, resulting in higher wages. Those increased labor costs could shrink profit margins, especially in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, and manufacturing. AI stocks have been some of the strongest in the market this year, with companies including AI chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) driving indexes to new heights. Next year is expected to usher in another phase of AI development, which could lead to greater efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Murphy said there will also be “increased awareness and scrutiny of the importance of developing and deploying AI in a way that is ethical, secure, transparent, reliable, and respectful of intellectual property rights.” Trump’s election win drove down renewable energy stocks, largely due to his hostile stance on climate policy. Murphy acknowledged that Trump’s victory could transform U.S. energy policy by prioritizing fossil fuels and opposing climate initiatives. But she said this doesn’t mean the renewable energy sector will stop growing. “Data center and AI rollout has increased demand for renewables by a significant amount this year, and we expect this to continue,” she said. “These data centers require massive power expenditures, and the companies building out these data centers frequently have self-imposed clean energy mandates.” It also remains to be seen how Trump’s close relationship with billionaire Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will influence U.S. policy toward electric vehicles.

Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT two years ago, the tech industry has been consumed by generative artificial intelligence — and the next year will see more businesses adopt the technology, one tech executive predicts. Enterprises are already looking for technology to scale and implement AI, and the focus in 2025 will be on more efficiency and less risk, Hillery Hunter, chief technology officer and general manager of innovation at IBM (IBM) Infrastructure, told Quartz. With cost efficiency in mind, enterprises will likely look for smaller, more targeted generative AI models, Hunter said. Businesses could also turn to ensembles — or combining multiple machine learning or deep learning models for more accurate and robust results — that will allow them “to optimize latency, efficiency and accuracy across their AI workloads,” Hunter said. “For example,” Hunter said, “enterprises would have the option to use smaller, faster and more energy-efficient models on a CPU [core processing unit] as a starting point for data analysis and processing and then use larger models on a GPU [graphics processing unit], as needed, for more complex workloads that require extra performance, all within the same AI Workflow.” In July, Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang said the next wave of AI is for businesses, and that everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.” “We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.” As the tech industry focuses on launching new AI products, it’s now AI agents, or software that can complete complex tasks autonomously, that have taken over the chatbot hype. Most AI-powered tools that have launched so far are co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, but have to be prompted over and over. In the next year, companies will risk being left behind if they don’t step up their AI efforts, Hunter said. While businesses saw AI become more important this year, they “often struggled with disjointed AI process steps and driving true ROI [return on investment].” Businesses have to bring AI projects together in 2025, Hunter said, or otherwise create “an increasingly bloated tech environment” with more costs and slower innovation. “It’s time for enterprises to kill the Frankencloud — a disjointed environment where data is duplicated and sprawled out across various, disconnected locations — and create the holistic view they need to actually leverage and govern the data and models associated with AI, and generate outcomes that support their AI investment,” Hunter said. Next year will also see enterprises commit to getting out of “tech debt” — debt from failing to modernize IT infrastructure or not having unified IT or cloud-based solutions that are needed to optimize AI. “AI itself will help modernize IT, but in the year ahead, collaboration across the C-suite is going to be key to getting out of this debt,” Hunter said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The buzz around generative artificial intelligence (AI) and expectations of falling interest rates are driving several technology stocks higher. While there are concerns about stretched valuations, Wall Street analysts continue to see further upside in many tech names. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alibaba (BABA) against each other to find the tech stock that could offer the highest upside potential from current levels, according to analysts. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Apple shares have risen about 29% so far this year. The iPhone maker impressed investors with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.64, with sales rising 6% to $94.9 billion. Notably, revenue from iPhone, which accounted for about 49% of the overall sales, grew 5.5% to $46.2 billion. Moreover, revenue from Services, which is a higher-margin business compared to Apple’s products, grew 12% to about $25 billion. Apple expects its Services revenue growth in the December quarter to be nearly the same as its growth rate in the past year (12.9%). Further, the company expects its December overall sales to rise by “low to mid-single digit.” While there are concerns about the impact of competition on iPhone sales in key markets like China, several analysts remain confident about the company due to its growing Services business and AI initiatives like Apple Intelligence. Baird analyst William Power raised the price target for Apple stock to $260 from $240 while reiterating a Buy rating. Power noted that AAPL currently trades at 32.8x of the calendar year 2025 EPS estimate, reflecting about a 50% premium to the S&P 500’s (SPX) multiple of 22x. He added that his $260 target price is based on a 34x P/E multiple (calculated on 2025 EPS forecast), placing it towards the high end of the stock’s 10-35x historical range and a premium to other tech and consumer leaders. Power explained that the premium valuation reflects solid execution, growing contribution from Services, continued eco-system benefits, and impressive free cash flow. With 20 Buys, nine Holds, and two Sells, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock. The average AAPL stock price target of $243.20 implies 2% downside risk. See more AAPL analyst ratings Semiconductor giant Nvidia’s shares have rallied more than 171% year-to-date, driven by the robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required for powering generative AI models and applications. Last month, Nvidia reported market-beating results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Revenue grew 94% year-over-year to $35.1 billion, while adjusted EPS jumped 103% to $0.81. Despite strong Q3 results, there have been some concerns about the slowdown in revenue growth. Additionally, investors are worried about the longevity of the AI-induced demand. Nonetheless, Nvidia is optimistic about its future prospects, supported by robust demand for its Hopper and Blackwell platforms amid the generative AI boom. Following the Q3 print, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso raised the price target on NVIDIA stock to $180 from $150 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst said that the new price target is based on a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of about 42x his 2025 (calendar year) EPS estimate of $4.26, which is slightly above the stock’s nearly 37x average multiple over the past five years. Caso further contended that the P/E multiple of 42x is reasonable given his expectation for almost 50% revenue growth next year. The analyst said that NVDA had been his favorite stock for several years, and continues to be so, given that it is the chief beneficiary of the AI wave. Caso thinks there is a clear path to over $200 billion in data center revenue based on supply chain forecasts related to the Blackwell ramp, which could drive an EPS of $5 in Fiscal 2026. Coming to the consensus rating, Nvidia scores a Strong Buy based on 37 buys and three Hold recommendations. At $176.14, the average NVDA stock price target implies 31.2% upside potential. See more NVDA analyst ratings Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba recently announced upbeat earnings for the September quarter. Net income jumped 58% to RMB 43.9 billion, driven by the rise in operating income and mark-to-market changes in equity investments. Meanwhile, revenue grew 5% to RMB 236.5 billion even as macro pressures continue to impact consumer spending. In a statement on the September quarter results, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu stated that the company is more confident about its core businesses and continues to invest in its long-term growth. BABA shares have advanced more than 15% so far this year, partially due to the optimism about the stimulus measures being assured by the Chinese government to boost the economy. Despite macro uncertainty and the US-China tensions, several analysts are bullish on BABA due to its restructuring efforts, the company’s cloud business, and AI-related growth opportunities. It is worth noting that the growth in Alibaba’s Cloud business accelerated in the September quarter compared to the prior quarters, with revenue from public cloud products increasing by double digits and AI-related product revenue witnessing triple-digit growth. Recently, Alibaba announced that it will integrate its domestic Chinese and international e-commerce platforms into a single business unit (called the E-commerce Business Group) amid intense competition. The company aims to create synergies in its supply chain with this move. Reacting to this announcement, Citi analyst Alicia Yap reaffirmed a Buy rating on Alibaba stock and stated that she views the announcement positively. The analyst, who has a price target of $133 on BABA stock, noted that this step could fuel synergies across Alibaba’s Taobao Tmall Group and the International Digital Commerce Group, driving improvement in operations and financial performance. Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, backed by 14 Buys versus one Hold rating. The average BABA stock price target of $127.05 implies about 45% upside potential. See more BABA analyst ratings Wall Street is highly bullish on Alibaba and Nvidia stocks but cautiously optimistic about Apple. Analysts see higher upside potential in Alibaba stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants, thanks to improving fundamentals, AI-related prospects, and the Chinese government’s stimulus measures. Interestingly, as per TipRanks’ Smart Score System, both Alibaba and Nvidia score a “Perfect 10,” implying that both these stocks are well-positioned to outperform the broader market over the long term.

Title: Will Sticky Inflation Stop The Fed Rate Cut?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/12/15/will-sticky-inflation-stop-the-fed-rate-cut/
Time Published: 2024-12-15T12:00:00Z

Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates. Fed Rate Cuts Expected Stocks finally saw a down week after the S&P 500 hit all-time highs the previous week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), continued to move higher. The returns on the Magnificent 7 and bank stocks have been stellar since the U.S. Presidential election. Tesla (TSLA) has stood out since the election, rising almost 74%! Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again. Stocks are in the midst of the most favorable time of the year, so the seasonals add some comfort that last week’s decline shouldn’t prove to be the start of a significant decline. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Jordan Klein, a tech desk sector strategist at Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), expecting the company’s management to deliver a highly optimistic perspective during investor sessions at the CES conference in early January. Mizuho projects NVIDIA's stock could climb to the $160-$170 range ahead of the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, where the company is set to unveil its new product, Rubin. "All agree that NVDA sets up well to go on another run to new all-time highs in Q125 into Feb earnings date and GTC in March,” Klein wrote. “View is that NVDA mgmt. will reinforce a very bullish view at investor meetings during CES in early Jan. I get sense some think Next (LON:NXT) stop NVDA is $160-170 level into GTC and the big preview of Rubin. I can feel the NVDA – AMD pair trade being sized up already," he added. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts reaffirmed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their top pick for 2025, highlighting three key catalysts supporting their optimistic outlook. The first driver is the potential impact of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI initiative, on iPhone replacement cycles. While current iPhone demand remains muted, Morgan Stanley sees broader availability of Apple Intelligence in fiscal 2025 sparking a surge in demand. The firm forecasts iPhone shipments to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026, fueled by features such as enhanced Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. “A relatively moderate replacement cycle contraction of just 0.3 years off an all-time replacement cycle high of ~5 years” is expected, according to analysts led by Erik W. Woodring. The second catalyst is sustained double-digit growth in Apple’s services segment, underpinned by pricing power, broader adoption, and new offerings. Morgan Stanley projects an 11.4% compound annual growth rate in services revenue through fiscal 2027, exceeding consensus expectations. The report highlights that less than half of Apple’s user base currently subscribes to services. Combined with mid-single-digit annual growth in the installed base and pricing adjustments, annual services growth could gain an additional six percentage points. Finally, Morgan Stanley anticipates steady gross margin expansion over the next three years, driven by a favorable revenue mix, cost efficiencies, and the faster growth of services revenue. While memory costs have risen, the analysts highlight “an emerging cyclical tailwind in 2025” as memory prices stabilize. They estimate annual gross margin growth of 50 basis points through fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its price target for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $260 from $240, highlighting the growing potential of generative AI (GenAI) applications as a key growth driver. The firm pointed to innovations showcased at the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference, which aim to overcome barriers in deploying GenAI solutions and pave the way for significant growth in fiscal 2025. According to Mizuho, AWS’s efforts are centered on three areas: cost reduction, simplified application development, and advanced AI-agent functionalities. AWS’s new Trainium2 chip, which reduces capacity costs by 40%, is expected to provide a cost-effective solution for scaling GenAI. Mizuho also emphasized the Bedrock platform’s ability to streamline coding, data integration, and model selection, enabling faster application development. Further, AWS is advancing AI-agent workflows in areas like loan underwriting, using foundational models with enhanced reasoning and context processing capabilities. These developments are expected to drive GenAI adoption across industries. "With use-cases moving into production, we expect inferencing volume should accelerate through application development and usage in FY25, affirming our thesis of Gen-AI's consumption multiplier effect," Mizuho wrote. In turn, the firm has increased its FY25 AWS revenue growth forecast to 21%, up from 19%. Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock to Neutral from Buy, citing risks to its 2025 outlook. The firm also cut its price target for AMD to $155 from $180 and reduced its 2025/26 earnings per share (EPS) projections by 6% and 8%, noting a 13-23% gap compared to consensus estimates. Two key factors underpin BofA’s cautious view. The first is competitive pressure in the AI market, particularly from NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which could constrain AMD’s market share growth. “Recently largest cloud customer, Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD,” adding that other major cloud providers, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), show similar preferences. BofA estimates AMD will hold just 4% of the $200 billion AI accelerator market in 2025, a sharp contrast to NVIDIA’s dominant 80%+ share. The second concern is a potential slowdown in the PC processor market in early 2025. After a robust 40% half-on-half increase in AMD’s client PC sales in late 2024, BofA expects the market could soften, putting pressure on the company’s growth trajectory. On the other hand, BofA acknowledged AMD’s strong execution and ability to benefit from Intel’s restructuring, which could open doors for greater market share in PC and server CPUs. The report also highlighted AMD’s solid relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as positives but noted limited opportunities for the company to exceed Street expectations in the AI segment. Following weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, TD Cowen downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Buy to Hold and lowered its price target from $625 to $550. The firm highlighted several challenges that could weigh on Adobe's growth prospects, including a slowdown in growth trends and potential disruptions related to changes in its go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Adobe reported fourth-quarter net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $578 million, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. While this exceeded guidance by about 5%, it fell short of the average beat over the trailing twelve months. For fiscal 2025, Adobe’s growth guidance of 8-10%—including a 50-75 basis points headwind from foreign exchange—came in below the Street’s expectation of 11%. Moreover, management forecasts a 50 basis points decline in operating margin, contrary to the flat margin projected by analysts. ARR growth is also expected to slow, decelerating from 13% to 11%. TD Cowen also notes that Adobe is prioritizing the adoption of AI technologies over immediate monetization. While some AI-driven initiatives, such as GenStudio for enterprises and the AI Assistant in Acrobat, are gaining traction, they currently represent a small portion of revenue. Looking ahead, analysts see multiple headwinds for Adobe in 2025. These include the waning of pricing tailwinds in the first half of the year, potential disruptions from GTM changes in the first quarter, and indications of weaker growth trends based on partner checks.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI made canvas, an interface to “collaborate” with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects, available to all web and Windows desktop users this week. The feature was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October. Now out of beta, canvas is built directly into OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, so it doesn’t need to be selected separately in ChatGPT’s model picker. Other new features include running Python code directly in canvas for improvement suggestions and bug fixes, and compatibility with custom-made GPTs. Cohere released Command R7B — the smallest, fastest, and last model in its R series of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise — this week. Due to its compact size, the model can be served on low-end graphics processing units (GPUs), core processing units (CPUs), and a MacBook to accelerate production of AI applications. In its class of open-weights models, Command R7B delivers state-of-the-art performance in real-world tasks such as reasoning and agentic behavior, according to the startup. “The model is designed for developers and businesses that need to optimize for the speed, cost-performance, and compute resources of their use cases,” Cohere said. Command R7B is available on the Cohere Platform and on HuggingFace. Speak, a language learning AI startup, announced a $78 million Series C funding round this week. The deal, which values the company at $1 billion, was led by Accel, and included existing investors such as OpenAI Startup Fund and Khosla Ventures. The Series C marks the AI language tutor’s second raise this year, and has doubled the startup’s valuation in six months. “We’ve engineered a breakthrough in spoken fluency by combining our proprietary learning method with advanced AI that adapts to each user’s needs, making true fluency accessible to so many more people,” Connor Zwick, chief executive and co-founder of Speak, said in a statement. “So far this year, users have already spoken more than one billion sentences with Speak.” Zwick said Speak plans to expand to more countries in 2025. Ayar Labs, a startup that developed the first in-package optical I/O solution to replace electrical I/O in AI training and inferencing chips, announced a $155 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Advent Global Opportunities and Light Street Capital, and included investments from AMD Ventures (AMD), Intel Capital (INTC), and Nvidia (NVDA). Ayar Labs is now valued at more than $1 billion. The startup is changing the way data moves between chips with its I/O technology, which it says can “eliminate bottlenecks created by traditional copper interconnects and pluggable optics.” The funding will allow Ayar Labs to scale its technology, which “allows customers to maximize the compute efficiency and performance of their AI infrastructure, while reducing costs and power consumption, to dramatically improve profitability metrics for AI applications.” “The leading GPU providers — AMD and NVIDIA — and semiconductor foundries — GlobalFoundries (GFS), Intel Foundry, and TSMC (TSM) — combined with the backing of Advent, Light Street, and our other investors underscores the potential of our optical I/O technology to redefine the future of AI infrastructure,” Mark Wade, chief executive and co-founder of Ayar Labs, said in a statement. “We are incredibly fortunate to have the backing of Light Street’s deep expertise in technology-specific investments as well as Advent’s robust private and growth equity background in this funding round.” Gentrace, a developer platform that allows entire product teams to collaborate on AI testing and monitoring, announced an $8 million Series A funding round this week. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and brings the startup’s total funding to $14 million. With the Gentrace platform, product managers, subject matter experts, designers, and quality assurance can all collaborate on evaluating AI model performance with engineering teams. The startup also launched Experiments, a tool enabling collaborative large language model (LLM) testing. The tool allows teams to preview test outcomes before deploying models and anticipate errors, among other features. “Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in software development, but the reality is there’s way too much noise and not enough signal on how to test and build them easily or correctly,” Doug Safreno, co-founder and chief executive of Gentrace, said in a statement. “We’re not just creating another dev tool — we’re reimagining how entire organizations can collaborate and build better LLM products.” Crusoe, a vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider, announced a $600 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Founders Fund and included Nvidia as an investor. The startup provides cost-effective and “environmentally aligned” AI infrastructure by harnessing large-scale clean energy. Crusoe also builds AI-optimized data centers and has a development platform. “We believe a new approach is needed to power the AI revolution,” Chase Lochmiller, chief executive and co-founder of Crusoe, said in a statement. “To reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-value, and support the most demanding AI solutions, customers need a vertically integrated approach. We are able to innovate faster and bring new, state-of-the-art capacity online in a fraction of the time compared to legacy cloud providers while delivering unmatched results for customers, making the promises of AI a reality.” Crusoe also announced its Crusoe Cloud platform is generally available for AI and machine learning workloads.
