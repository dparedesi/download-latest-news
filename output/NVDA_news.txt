Title: Big Short’s Michael Burry Abruptly Sells Everything – Except for One ‘Recession-Proof’ Asset

“Big Short” hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 collapse of the housing market, just initiated a major portfolio shakeup. New SEC filings from Burry’s Scion Asset Management show the firm has taken a substantial bearish stance against Nvidia (NVDA), opening a large position in put options against the chipmaker’s stock. Scion has also reversed its previously bullish outlook on Chinese equities. The fund acquired bearish put options on major Chinese companies, including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). And here’s the twist – Scion’s only remaining long position is in New York-based Estee Lauder (EL), a bet on the cosmetics giant’s potential recovery. This solitary bullish stance underscores Burry’s cautious approach on the market, with the makeup industry often believed to be resilient to recession. This is the second time in recent years that Burry has gutted Scion’s portfolio. In 2023, Burry drastically reduced Scion’s holdings, only to later admit he was wrong while placing new, targeted bets.

Billionaire investor David Tepper apparently no longer thinks it's time to buy "everything" in China. Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa L.P. slashed its stakes in several Chinese companies in recent months, according to the firm's latest 13-F filing. The fund slashed its position in Baidu (BIDU) nearly in half and its stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA), JD.com (JD), Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD), and Chinese real estate platform KE Holdings (BEKE) by 19% to 26% since its last filing in February. It also lowered its stake in the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) by about 16% and 13%, respectively. In an interview with CNBC last September, the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers said the government stimulus package China was putting into its economy at the time made it an attractive place for investors. Tepper said he would want to buy "everything" in the country, as the stimulus would impact assets from stocks to ETFs and bonds. The latest filing also revealed that Appaloosa opened a 130,000-share position in Broadcom (AVGO) in the last three months, and that it sold the last of its stakes in FedEx (FDX) and Intel (INTC). The firm also boosted its shares of Meta Platforms (META), and cut its ownership of Lyft (LYFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Title: AI, Quantum Stocks Are Some of the Most Shorted on Wall Street

AI stocks are the hottest trades on Wall Street again. They're also among traders' favorite stocks to bet against. Wall Street regained its risk appetite this week thanks to easing U.S.-China tensions, soft inflation data, and a slew of deal announcements out of President Trump's Middle East tour. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), sometimes called “the fear index,” dropped below 20 for the first time since March on Monday and has held steady since then. AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been among the biggest beneficiaries of investors' subsiding fear. But with stock gains comes speculation that the rally won't last, and thus more interest from active traders, like hedge funds, looking for opportunities to profit from pullbacks. Among the stocks least loved by active traders is SoundHound AI (SOUN). Traders have sold short about $1.2 billion of the Nvidia-backed company’s stock, compared with just $340 million of long positions, according to data from market research firm S3 Partners. Another notable name: Super Micro Computer (SMCI), shares of which have soared about 40% this week amid a blistering AI rally. The total value of Supermicro short positions exceeds long positions by more than half a billion dollars. In dollar terms, SoundHound and Supermicro skew short more than most stocks. But relative to their size, these two stocks have more bullish support than some other hot stocks. Traders have sold short five times as much Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock as they’ve bought long. Two more quantum computing stocks—IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS)—have short-to-long ratios exceeding 2:1. Other stocks in which short positions are about double long positions include Plug Power (PLUG), Trump Media & Technology (DJT), and GameStop (GME).

CoreWeave stock tumbled Wednesday following its first earnings report since going public, as the data center company’s growing capital expenditure raised concerns among investors. Shares in the Nvidia-backed (NVDA-1.54%) company initially dropped more than 13% during after-hours trading, following the results before shares rebounded on Thursday morning. CoreWeave is a so-called ‘picks and shovels’ company of the AI revolution. It’s one of the largest holders of Nvidia’s graphics processing units and leases data center capacity to Big Tech companies. The firm’s executives said in a call following the report’s publication that it expects to spend between $20 billion and $23 billion in 2025. That tops the $18.3 billion projected by Wall Street analysts, according to Yahoo Finance, citing Bloomberg consensus estimates. Analysts downgraded their outlook for CoreWeave stock following the news. Gil Luria of DA Davidson downgraded the stock to an Underperform rating from Neutral on Thursday morning, citing the “level of capital intensity equity investors are unlikely to stomach.” Luria also pointed to CoreWeave’s soaring interest expenses for the decision. The company’s interest expenses rose 549% in the first quarter, totaling $264 million. That’s more than the $182 million projected by Wall Street, according to Yahoo Finance (APO-2.36%), citing Bloomberg data. Operating expenses have been soaring too. While CoreWeave announced a 420% revenue increase from the same period last year, it also unveiled a 487% jump in operating costs, totaling more than $1 billion for the first quarter of the year. CoreWeave is not the first tech company to take an expensive gamble on AI-related infrastructure — and then be punished on Wall Street for it. Leading the pack is Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), which plans to allocate $80 billion in capital expenditures for data center development in the 2025 fiscal year, it announced in a January blog post. Analysts forecast that such spending could create a drag on margins for several years. Meanwhile, Amazon’s (AMZN-2.87%) capital expenditures are expected to reach approximately $75 billion in 2025, up more than 50% from the previous year. Following that company call in February, its stock slipped more than 5% in after-hours trading. Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%) also plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, the majority of which to be directed to enhancing technical infrastructure for AI, it announced during a call with investors in February. Google’s stock fell more than 8% immediately after. Likewise, Meta (META-2.36%) has set its AI capital expenditure budget at $60 billion to $65 billion for 2025—a significant jump from previous years.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The cryptocurrency market pulled back over the last 24 hours, led by declines in major coins as retail investors switched out of large-cap tokens and into smaller, more speculative assets. Both bitcoin BTC$102,948.71 and ether ETH$2,413.97 dropped around 2% and the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broad market, fell 2.7%. "We’ve observed a significant week-on-week increase in retail participation, reinforcing the broader narrative of rising optimism," said Jake O., an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute. “The shift down the risk curve is most evident in retail screen flows.” Institutional investors, for their part, have been more conservative. They're still stocking up on bitcoin, ether and XRP$2.33, while easing off positions in solana SOL$161.76 which has faced “sustained pressures.” “Some are viewing SOLETH underperformance as an opportunity to position for Solana topside,” Jake noted, pointing to steady buying in $200 Solana call options ahead of June and July. Other options activity suggests traders are hedging for volatility ahead. Call spreads on ether were unwound and some traders moved into collar structures — strategies often used to protect against price swings — signaling caution after recent gains. The growing hedging activity adds a note of caution to retail's swing to speculation. Economic uncertainty, lingering inflation pressures and U.S. tariff policy are all weighing on risk appetite in crypto as well as traditional markets. Global asset managers, in fact, currently have their largest underweight position in the U.S. dollar in 19 years. Even though President Donald Trump secured a major investment deal with Qatar and a temporary reduction in U.S.-China tariffs, these outcomes may lead to further downside: Spanish bank Bankinter said in a note that the market has shown fatigue over the last trading session. “We still think the damage is done: both EPS and prices should feel the strain, with rising inflationary pressures preventing the Fed from cutting rates as much as the market expects,” the bank’s analysts wrote. Market participants are set to now focus on producer price inflation and retail sales data, as well as on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech later today. For the crypto market, a re-test of the all-time high isn’t out of the picture. “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on 19 May draws closer,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Investors are still rotating money into altcoins, lifting valuations for ETH, RAY, ENA, MKR and other tokens while leaving bitcoin (BTC) little changed above $100,000. While the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is just 7% short of hitting a new high, its 30-day options-based implied or expected volatility, represented by Deribit's DVOL index, is hovering near the lowest level since June 2024. This type of calm usually precedes big moves. Georgii Verbitskii, a market analyst and founder of TYMIO, a crypto investor app put it best: "Options implied volatility is extremely low, the market doesn't seem to believe in strong moves, and 1- to 3-month option pricing is still cheap. That kind of complacency often precedes a big move." BTC could quickly break through $115,000, Verbitskii said, noting that, "If the liquidity thesis holds — where global liquidity supports bitcoin — we could see that breakout as early as May." Just to remind you, bitcoin hit a record high around $109,000 in January. Still, the market faces potential headwinds. For instance, the U.S. Senate has its last opportunity to pass the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a bill introduced in February that calls for issuers to back digital currencies with safe reserves and report them monthly or deal with penalties. The bill was unable to advance in a recent vote. According to the Senate's rules another failure will kill the bill unless all senators agree to reconsider, according to Tagus Capital. Further, the U.S. SEC delayed a decision on Tuesday on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for BlackRock's bitcoin exchange-traded fund while it asks for feedback. In other news, DeFi Development Corp. purchased 172,670 SOL worth roughly $23.6 million, bringing its total Solana Treasury holdings to over $100 million. That's less common, with more companies running to bitcoin: An update from bitcoin-focused company River points out: "Thousands of companies across all sectors are using bitcoin to offset inflation and build up their treasury."
