Title: NVDA Vs. NVDY: What Your Pick Says About Your Investing Style

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia is the crown jewel of the AI boom. But how you choose to invest in it, either directly through NVDA stock or indirectly via the NVDY covered call income ETF, reflects your risk appetite, time horizon and definition of returns. This article explores which option (NVDA stock vs. NVDY) is a better fit for your portfolio and what your choice reveals about your investor persona. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) is an actively managed fund that does not invest directly in Nvidia shares, but delivers a far higher income yield vs. NVDA. The fund’s staggering trailing twelve-month (TTM) distribution yield of nearly 80% stems from a unique strategy that generates monthly income through options without actually owning NVDA stock. To achieve this, NVDY implements a “synthetic covered call” strategy by which it To generate monthly income by selling short-term covered calls, NVDY first needs a long exposure to NVDA stock. Rather than buying NVDA shares outright, NVDY creates a cheaper, synthetic long position by This combo allows NVDY to simulate NVDA stock’s price moves, without actually buying the stock. These call and put options typically have durations of one to six months and strike prices near NVDA’s current price at the time these option contracts are executed. The synthetic long position provides NVDY with exposure that is nearly identical to owning NVDA stock. If NVDA rises, the call gains in value and if NVDA falls, the put incurs a loss. If NVDA stays flat, typically both options may expire worthless, and the fund may lose the cost of the call, but this will be offset by the premium received from the short put. Suppose NVDA stock is currently trading at $200/share. NVDY buys a call option with a strike price of $200 (at-the-money) by paying a premium of $15. (Premiums vary depending on volatility and expiration, and the $15 figures here are for illustrative purposes.) This gives NVDY the right to buy NVDA at $200. If NVDA rises to $250, the call option’s value would increase to $50. Subtracting the $15 premium paid, the net profit on the call is $35. As part of the synthetic strategy, NVDY also sells a put option with a $200 strike price, receiving a $15 premium. This gives it the obligation to buy NVDA at $200 if the price falls below that level. If NVDA drops to $150, NVDY is forced to buy at $200, incurring a $50 loss on the put. After subtracting the $15 premium received, the net loss is $35. These call and put options together form a synthetic long position, mimicking the payoff of directly owning the stock. Although synthetic ownership is more complex than buying shares directly, it is significantly more capital-efficient. For example, buying 100 shares of NVDA at $200 each would require $20,000 upfront. A synthetic long position created by buying a call and selling a put at the same $200 strike can replicate this exposure. If the premiums for both options are around $15 each, the net upfront premium may be close to zero. Since each options contract typically represents 100 shares, this setup simulates $20,000 of stock exposure with little or no net premium paid. However, this does not mean the position is free. The short put side of the trade introduces significant downside risk and typically requires substantial margin or collateral. While the strategy uses less capital than directly purchasing the stock, margin requirements and potential losses can be huge. This is an oversimplified example meant to illustrate the concept of capital efficiency. In practice, actual capital requirements and risk exposure will vary depending on market conditions and brokerage policies. Investors don’t need to worry about this nitty-gritty, NVDY fund managers will handle the complexities. NVDY then sells calls against this synthetic long position to generate income from premiums. These call options are typically short-term (expiring within one month or less) and are written at strike prices 0–15% above NVDA’s current price at the time. If NVDA’s price goes up, NVDY makes gains up to the strike price, but anything above that is capped, because the fund sold away that upside in exchange for income. If NVDA stays flat or dips slightly, NVDY retains the premium from selling the call options. This is its main source of monthly income. NVDY also holds short-term U.S. Treasuries that not only serve as collateral for the options in connection with its synthetic covered call strategy, but also earn some interest. NVDY also employs a “Covered Call Spread” strategy—a more nuanced variation of the traditional covered call—used when it anticipates a sharp short-term rise in NVDA’s price or when market conditions make spreads more advantageous than outright calls. In this strategy, NVDY sells a call option while simultaneously buying a call option with a higher strike price but the same expiration date. This approach still generates income and, if NVDA’s price surges, allows NVDY to participate in more upside than a regular covered call would. NVDA stock and NVDY are both Nvidia-focused investments but serve different goals: NVDA stock is regarded as a growth superstar, while NVDY is designed as a tactical income generator. For NVDA investors, gains and losses move in lockstep with the stock price. But, NVDY’s returns, shaped by its synthetic long structure, follow a more complicated path. So, we notice that drawdowns are more or less similar for NVDA and NVDY, but gains are capped for NVDY. So, why invest in NVDY at all? Because of the outsized income yield from NVDY that far surpasses NVDA’s. NVDY pays varying monthly distributions, while NVDA pays a penny in quarterly dividends. On a TTM basis, NVDY has paid distributions totaling $14.04/share, equating to 78.7% distribution yield based on NVDY’s last closing price of $17.85. This far surpasses NVDA’s 0.02% forward yield or annual payout of 4 cents/share on a forward basis. Price performance and Total Returns (including dividends/distributions): Even with NVDY’s hefty monthly distributions, NVDA has delivered stronger total returns. NVDY’s monthly payouts are a mix of return of capital (ROC) and ordinary income (such as option premiums and interest from Treasuries) For example: Why this breakdown matters: Return of capital isn’t taxed when received. Instead, it reduces your cost basis in the ETF, which can increase taxable capital gains when you sell. Illustration: Once your cost basis is reduced to zero, any further ROC distributions are treated entirely as capital gains for tax purposes. The income portion of the payout, however, is taxable in the year received. For July, this would mean the remaining 63% of the distribution was taxable income. Expense Ratio: YieldMax lists NVDY’s gross expense ratio as 0.99%, while many third-party sites like Yahoo Finance report the net expense ratio as 1.27%. That means an investor pays $127 annually for every $10,000 invested in NVDY. Let’s say an investor bought 1,000 shares of NVDY a year ago at around $24/share: Even after accounting for the $304.80 annual fee (1.27% of $24,000), the net income is still exceptionally high. In other words, the expense ratio barely dents NVDY’s income advantage. Since its inception on May 10, 2023, when it was trading around $20, NVDY has paid out $32.71 in distributions. Investors who purchased one share at launch would have recovered their full initial investment and realized an additional $12.71 in income. It is important to note that NVDY shareholders do not receive any dividends paid by Nvidia (NVDA) directly. But with these juicy payouts from NVDY, no investor would have missed much. When it comes to NVDA, the math is simple. You’ll need about 10× the cost of an NVDY share to buy one share of NVDA. Sell NVDA in a taxable account, and you’ll owe capital gains taxes on your profits. Sell it in a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k), and those taxes can be pushed to another day. Lower Entry Cost: NVDY trades at roughly one-tenth the price of NVDA stock, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Capital Efficiency: Through its synthetic long position strategy, NVDY can mimic exposure to thousands of dollars’ worth of NVDA stock with a minimal capital outlay. Attractive Yields - NVDY’s covered call strategy generates eye-catching yields, appealing to income-focused investors. NVDA on the other hand is coveted for its growth potential rather than dividends. Faster Capital Recovery: NVDY’s hefty and frequent payouts can help investors achieve “house money” status quickly, recovering their initial investment through distributions. This can substantially de-risk the investment. NVDA requires selling shares to realize profits. Occasional Upside Participation: when NVDA stock is expected to rally in the short-term (because of a sell-off or some positive development) NVDY employs the “Covered Call Spread” strategy, allowing more upside capture versus a standard covered call if NVDA’s price surges. Asymmetric Downside: NVDY’s synthetic long structure caps upside but leaves investors fully exposed to NVDA’s downside. High monthly income may not be able to offset losses from a sharp NVDA correction. Investor Exodus: Significant price drops in NVDY can trigger investor outflows, lowering Assets Under Management (AUM) and making it harder to generate option income efficiently, thereby creating a negative feedback loop. Distribution volatility: While NVDA offers paltry dividends, NVDY’s monthly payouts can fluctuate sharply — largely because they rely on option premium income and include return of capital. When NVDA’s implied volatility drops or NVDY’s Net Asset Value (NAV) erodes from repeated ROC payouts, the ETF’s distributions could shrink. Opportunity Cost: Historically NVDA’s returns have outpaced NVDY’s significantly. Simply holding NVDA stock may generate greater total returns than NVDY, especially during strong bull runs in tech. If you are betting on Nvidia as a core pillar of an AI-driven future, and seek full participation in Nvidia’s growth story — you’re a Growth Chaser — you pick NVDA stock. If you are comfortable with capped upside and prioritize monthly income, you’re an Income Alchemist — you choose NVDY to tactically monetize volatility and generate consistent yield. If you are looking to blend growth and income — gaining exposure to Nvidia’s long-term upside while securing a steady income stream, you hold both: NVDA for capital appreciation and NVDY for monthly payouts. That makes you the Hedged Optimist. Bottom Line In my view, NVDA stock remains the superior play with its compelling long-term returns despite the meager dividend. The NVDA stock has clearly demonstrated resilience by rebounding and reaching new heights after every sharp correction, highlighting its structural strength. On the other hand, NVDY’s low capital requirements, exceptional yield and the potential to recover capital in a reasonable time frame are alluring. However, the risks of asymmetric downside and NAV erosion — potentially shrinking the very dividends investors seek — make NVDY better suited as a tactical, smaller allocation in a portfolio. By contrast, NVDA stock deserves to be a core holding and investors may consider accumulating on any weakness, although past performance is no guarantee for future results.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Jumps After CEO Meets With Trump
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-intel-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-ceo-meets-with-trump-11789224
Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:46:11Z

Intel (INTC) shares surged again Tuesday following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump on Monday. The meeting came after Trump on Fridy demanded the immediate resignation of Tan, calling him "highly conflicted" over investments in Chinese firms. The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was "very interesting" and that Tan's success is "an amazing story." Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days. Trump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Intel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location. More recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock. Let’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap. A decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July. Buying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March. During future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.

Title: Trump says Nvidia's 15% duty applies to ‘old’ H20 chips, may permit export of up to 50% downgraded Blackwell chip

Time Published: 2025-08-12T01:36:12Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump stated that the current duties over Nvidia's export deal with China only cover the older H20 chip, which he described as “essentially old." Speaking to the reporters on Monday (E.T.), Trump said he would consider a deal that would let Nvidia send its Blackwell chips to China if the company could make them less advanced. “It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said.. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit this week to discuss the new chip, Blackwell. Earlier, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) had agreed to give 15% of their Chinese AI chip sales revenues to the US government. This deal is meant to secure export licenses and is considered an unusual arrangement that could unsettle both US companies and Beijing, reported Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut for the US if he approved H20 sales to China, but he ultimately agreed to a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said. Nvidia intends to allocate 15% of its revenue from H20 AI accelerator sales China, the report noted citing a person familiar with the matter, while AMD will pay the same share from MI308 revenues. The revenue-sharing agreement for Nvidia's H20 chip and the possibility of another one for Blackwell chip highlight Trump’s consistent effort to orchestrate a financial gain for America in exchange for trade concessions. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, risk setting a precedent for all American companies operating in the Asian nation and may undermine the US government’s justification for export controls, the report said, citing experts. Over the past week, Trump has criticised chipmakers with various statements that unsettled firms from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless companies invested more in the US. However, these new tariffs would likely affect very few companies, as most major chipmakers are already covered by existing investments or trade agreements.

August 11, 2025 11:01 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SIGGRAPH -- NVIDIA today announced new NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models (WFMs) that accelerate the development and deployment of robotics solutions. Powered by new NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers and NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, the libraries and models let developers anywhere develop physically accurate digital twins, capture and reconstruct the real world in simulation, generate synthetic data for training physical AI models and build AI agents that understand the physical world. “Computer graphics and AI are converging to fundamentally transform robotics,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technologies at NVIDIA. “By combining AI reasoning with scalable, physically accurate simulation, we’re enabling developers to build tomorrow’s robots and autonomous vehicles that will transform trillions of dollars in industries.” New NVIDIA Omniverse Libraries Advance Applications for World CompositionNew NVIDIA Omniverse software development kits (SDKs) and libraries are now available for building and deploying industrial AI and robotics simulation applications. Omniverse NuRec rendering is now integrated in CARLA, a leading open-source simulator used by over 150,000 developers. Autonomous vehicle (AV) toolchain leader Foretellix is integrating NuRec, NVIDIA Omniverse Sensor RTX™ and Cosmos Transfer to enhance its scalable synthetic data generation with physically accurate scenarios. Voxel51’s data engine for visual and multimodal AI, FiftyOne, supports NuRec to ease data preparation for reconstructions. FiftyOne is used by customers such as Ford and Porsche. Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, RAI Institute, Lightwheel and Skild AI are adopting Omniverse libraries, Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to accelerate their AI robotics development, while Amazon Devices & Services is using them to power a new manufacturing solution. Cosmos Advances World Generation for RoboticsCosmos WFMs, downloaded over 2 million times, let developers generate diverse data for training robots at scale using text, image and video prompts. New models announced at SIGGRAPH deliver major advances in synthetic data generation speed, accuracy, language support and control: Lightwheel, Moon Surgical and Skild AI are using Cosmos Transfer to accelerate physical AI training by simulating diverse conditions at scale. Cosmos Reason Breaks Through World UnderstandingSince the introduction of OpenAI’s CLIP model, vision language models (VLMs) have transformed computer-vision tasks like object and pattern recognition. However, they have not yet been able to solve multistep tasks nor handle ambiguity or novel experiences. NVIDIA Cosmos Reason — a new open, customizable, 7-billion-parameter reasoning VLM for physical AI and robotics — lets robots and vision AI agents reason like humans, using prior knowledge, physics understanding and common sense to understand and act in the real world. Cosmos Reason can be used for robotics and physical AI applications including: NVIDIA’s robotics and NVIDIA DRIVE™ teams are using Cosmos Reason for data curation and filtering, annotation and VLA post-training. Uber is using it to annotate and caption AV training data.

Title: Trump is calling Wall Street’s bluff on tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Wall Street traders embraced the term TACO — Trump always chickens out — earlier this year to describe President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again position on tariffs. Trump liked to impose hefty import taxes but would inevitably back off when markets plunged, analysts said. Now Trump is calling the market’s bluff. Yet another round of new tariffs went effect on Thursday, lifting the average tax on US imports to the highest level since the 1930s. Trump bet markets would absorb this latest news, adapt and move on — and so far he appears to have been right. Stocks still closed higher on the week, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 notching its best week in over one month. It’s a remarkable shift from early April, when the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs caused stocks across the globe to plunge. But with economists saying tariff effects could take weeks or months to play out, it’s too soon to declare victory just yet. “He is succeeding in implementing major tariffs without shocking the stock market,” said Ethan Harris, former head of global economics at Bank of America. “It’s surprising, and you could call it an accomplishment if you’re in favor of tariffs.” Trump may be winning the hand, but Wall Street has lots of cards left. The game isn’t over. Investors in recent months have embraced the “TACO” trade. A better description would be, “Trump always tries again,” according to Harris. With the latest import taxes, Trump is pushing forward with an average tariff rate just slightly slower than what he tried to impose on April 2, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. While stocks are hovering near record highs, Harris said he expects tariffs will inflict “real damage” on the economy, and it remains to be seen if investors will stay complacent. The inclusion of carveouts has softened the blow of tariffs, according to Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income at UBS. That has helped temper investors’ concerns. Apple (AAPL), for example, is exempt from tariffs on some imports from India and tariffs on semiconductors because of its pledge to develop production in the United States. Apple stock last week soared 13% and had its best week since 2020. “The tariff wall being built by the administration also has many holes because of numerous product exemptions, carveouts and delayed implementation dates,” Reiman said. Enthusiasm about the AI boom in the United States is also driving market momentum and drawing attention away from tariffs. While investors have been concerned about trade, blowout earnings from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) have helped buoy the market. In addition, trading partners have largely not retaliated, avoiding a global trade war that would have had worse outcomes for the US economy, according to David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie. “What’s really struck me is how little Trump has had to chicken out from,” Robert Armstrong, the Financial Times columnist who coined the term “TACO,” told CNN’s Richard Quest in an August 1 interview. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked in early April above 50 points — a historic level not seen since the Covid pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The VIX in August just briefly breached 20 points — a level associated with slightly noticeable volatility — before retreating. Investors are maintaining faith in a “Trump put,” or the notion that if the markets do plummet, the president will refine his approach. The “Trump put” is different from chickening out, analysts say, as the president might back down just enough to satisfy markets before pushing forward again with his tariffs when he is able to. “He always tries again until the equity market punishes the policy,” Harris said. “That’s the old ‘Trump put’ idea, which is the way people used to talk about it, and is still the correct way to think about the trade war.” While Trump has implemented his tariffs, it might be too soon to call victory. Investors are awaiting data on inflation and the labor market in upcoming months to get a better sense of how tariffs are impacting the economy. “As an investor, you can talk yourself into not worrying about tariffs, but if you’re a company trying to make business plans, you can’t afford to ignore the tariffs,” Harris said. “The stock market and the economy are not the same thing.” Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said investors are taking two leaps of faith in believing in the resilience of the US economy and that “the stagflationary impulse of tariffs” — slower growth and stickier inflation — won’t be as bad as initially feared. Markets are a “little too complacent,” Sai said, and he will be watching the next two inflation reports ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting for any sign of tariff-induced increases in prices. “By no means are we out of the woods,” Sai said. “ We are priced for nothing to go wrong, and yet we still have a very important inflection point ahead of us.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Stock futures are edging higher ahead of key inflation data due later this week; Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reportedly agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for chip export licenses; Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after President Trump called for his resignation; and Bitcoin is rising near record levels, leading cryptocurrency-related stocks higher. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are pointing higher after the major market indexes posted gains last week, and ahead of inflation data and tech earnings due later this week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% in the premarket after the blue chip index added 1.6% last week. Nasdaq futures are up 0.2% after the the tech-heavy index closed at a record high to finish last week. S&P 500 futures are little changed to higher in premarket trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are little changed. Gold futures are slightly lower after surging last week. Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to give the U.S. government a 15% share of revenues from sales of certain chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses, the Financial Times reported. AMD said in its recent earnings report that restrictions on its China chip sales resulted in an $800 million hit. Nvidia is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month. AMD shares are about 2% lower in premarket trading, while Nvidia shares are down close to 1%. Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after Trump called for his resignation last week, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tan could use the visit to address concerns about his personal and professional background, while also communicating the importance of Intel’s manufacturing capabilities, the report said. Shares of Intel are up 2% in premarket trading. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is surging near all-time highs, rising more than 2.5% to trade above $121,100. Bitcoin’s record high was $123,218 set on July 14, when it jumped after the U.S. enacted legislation beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Shares of Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) are up by more than 3% in premarket trading, while crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) and mining firms Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are also higher. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world’s largest lithium producer, are jumping more than 10% in premarket trading as Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspends production at a major lithium mine. Bloomberg News reported that the stoppage could last three months and is due to a permitting issue. Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries, among other industrial uses. Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera, or SQM (SQM), is seeing its shares rise by more than 8%. The mining delays come after another Chinese lithium miner suspended production in July.

Title: Three Numbers That Prove Arista Is An Elite Tech Stock In Disguise

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not manufacture GPUs. It does not develop AI models. Additionally, it seldom attracts attention like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nonetheless, Arista has quietly emerged as one of the most impactful technology firms in the market. Strong Q2 results and elevated guidance propelled the stock to all-time highs, climbing 20% in the last five days compared to a 1.7% increase for the S&P 500. Three significant figures illustrate why Arista ranks among the most profitable and resilient players in the industry. Seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, check out What’s Happening With Joby Stock? Arista achieved a 40.3% net margin in Q2—higher than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), or Microsoft. It also sells hardware. The catalyst is Arista’s cloud-native EOS (Extensible Operating System), which transforms conventional networking hardware into a software-defined platform. This leads to high margins and stable, recurring demand from hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft (accounting for over 40% of revenue). Over half of Arista’s revenue is converted into cash. Its 54% operating cash flow margin ranks among the top 5% of S&P 500 firms—including most SaaS companies. This cash supports innovation, growth, and a balance sheet that is already among the strongest in the tech industry. Having $8.1 billion in cash (56% of assets) and no debt allows Arista to invest during downturns, protect its market standing, and expand globally without needing external financing. This strength has been tested: Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Arista is valued at 23.5x sales, 50.7x earnings, and 46.2x free cash flow—significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. On paper, it appears more like a SaaS company than a conventional networking entity. The distinction lies in execution. With established demand from major cloud providers, software-like margins, and an expanding role in AI data centers, Arista is enhancing its position in a rapidly growing market. Arista is not widely acknowledged outside of technology circles, but its profitability, strong balance sheet, and role in AI infrastructure render it a pivotal player in the sector. The stock is not inexpensive, and hazards persist, yet its performance has consistently justified its valuation. For investors seeking opportunities beyond chips and AI models, Arista provides access to the infrastructure that supports AI’s expansion—and the market is beginning to recognize this. That being said, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximizing profitable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

In terms of assessing how the general economy is responding to tariff and other uncertainty shocks, one might want to look at the SP500 excluding the Magnificent 7. As of August 8, SP500 market cap was $54.2 trillion; ex-Magnificent 7 was $36.7 trillion. Hence, the stock market is looking quite good partly because of the performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) stocks. The question is whether this outperformance is durable. One might say that the cyclically adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is not quite up to 2021M11 levels, so not to worry. I’ll just note that inflation expectations adjusted 10 year rates are now much higher: 2.1% in May vs. -1.0%. Figure 1: Cyclically adjusted price-earning (CAPE) ratio (black, left scale), and ten year ex ante real rate, % (light blue +, right scale).

NBER defined peak-to-trough recession dates shaded gray. Source: Shiller, Treasury via FRED, Philadelphia Fed, NBER and author’s calculations. Cape is as high in general to 2021. So yeah, its a problem. Margin debt is even higher. This seems concerning: “SCOOP: Trump’s team is considering longtime Bureau of Labor Statistics critic E.J. Antoni to run agency just after president fired Erika McEntarfer” https://x.com/schwartzbWSJ/status/1954660412407922766 And, he’s announced Antoni’s nomination. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/trump-antoni-bls-statistics.html I don’t think their relative market cap is the biggest issue. More salient is how concentrated earnings have become. In the aggregate the S&P 500 set another all time earnings record in Q2: https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_080825.pdf But a month ago.Earnings Insight forecast that “ In aggregate, the “Magnificent 7” companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 14.1% for the second quarter. Excluding these seven companies, the blended (combines actual and estimated results) earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 would be 3.4% for Q2 2025”: https://insight.factset.com/are-magnificent-7-companies-still-top-contributors-to-earnings-growth-for-the-sp-500-for-q2 CNBC says today that the magnificent 7 stocks profits grew 26% in Q2: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/sp-500-earnings-growth-would-be-dull-without-26percent-increase-from-mag-7.html One of the important things I look at is the advance-decline line, I.e., how many of the companies’ stocks are participating in the rally? Here they are: https://www.marketinout.com/chart/market.php?breadth=advance-decline-line Every market segment is currently showing no net advances in the past month, and a few of them are showing significant declines. In other words, the vast majority of companies have shown pedestrian earnings growth, and have had pedestrian stock price advances, if at all. I don’t think the advance-decline is a big problem yet. If memory serves, the A/D line had about a 50% decline from peak before the tech bubble popped in 2000. Very nice. A question: Having never given A/D analysis much thought until now, I’m curious whether a 50% decline ahead of one of the worst stock market declines in U.S. history amounts to a special case. Did it take an investing public too engaged in speculative buying to notice anything but their object of speculative buying to create that situation? Might we look for either a smaller decline in the A/D line to lead to a decline in overall equity market value in more common cases? While we’re at it, bullishness, as measured by a good many conventional bull/bear indicators, is high. Here’s the CNNMoney indicator, with components: https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed To NDd’s point about market breadth, the McClellan Volume Summation Index (a component of the CNN indicato), which is one method for comparing the number of gainers to losers, is neutral. I understand that portfolio cash levels are relatively low, despite a fairly good return to cash. Another contrarian indicator; not much fuel for additional gains.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Waiting For NVIDIA

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the second busiest week, the second-quarter earnings season begins to slow down this week, with just 6 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Deere (DE) and Applied Materials (AMAT). According to FactSet, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 90% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 11.8% year-over-year, well above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 10.3%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.3%. Following the better earnings results, the S&P 500 came within a hair of an all-time high last week, while the Magnificent 7 reached a new peak. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to Apple and Tesla. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 were the group to watch this earnings season, and they did not disappoint aside from Tesla (TSLA). Furthermore, the artificial intelligence (AI) related companies reinforced the positive narrative surrounding the technology. With earnings season nearing completion, all eyes now shift to NVIDIA (NVDA), which is scheduled to report on August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the healthcare and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 6.3% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the financials and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Earnings season slows to a crawl beginning this week. While the individual reports are crucial for that stock, none are going to change the overall color of the season at this point. Friday’s retail sales numbers will be an essential check on the US consumer. The soft monthly jobs report with massive downward revisions to start the month was worrisome for the health of the economy. Since the consumer drives the US economy, retail sales will be closely watched to see if the labor market is spilling over to spending. Consumer inflation (CPI) on Tuesday will be notable as the odds of a September short-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have risen to 90% following the weaker-than-expected jobs report. Year-over-year CPI is expected to increase to 2.8% from 2.7%, but the data will be watched for signs that the Fed needs to delay any cuts to fight inflation. There is still one more monthly jobs report before the Fed’s September meeting, and barring an abnormally large inflation surge, the labor market will be the primary driver behind any rate cuts or lack thereof. In addition, markets have now fully priced in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) in 2025. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a market mover. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) releases its 13F filing after the close on Thursday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks, but this report provides the details. An analysis of Berkshire’s quarterly earnings is here. The increase in worries about the economy in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report eased this week, with the betting odds of recession falling to the lows of the year. The falling odds of recession and another week of better-than-expected earnings sent stocks to near record highs.
