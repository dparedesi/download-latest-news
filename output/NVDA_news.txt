The sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration — including a 104% duty on Chinese imports — have one analyst calling the move an “Armageddon scenario” for the U.S. technology sector. That’s according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who warned Wednesday that President Donald Trump’s tariffs “will go down as the worst U.S. policy mistake” since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which deepened the Great Depression. Ives said the tariffs will significantly affect the U.S. tech sector because the “hearts and lungs of the supply chain are cemented in Asia.” He wrote, “A U.S. tech company CEO cannot decide last night... ‘Lets call Smith Semi Fab Operations in the Midwest to get those semi chips’... as there is one slight problem... IT DOES NOT EXIST... and would take 4-5 years to build a manufacturing plant... and the labor force does not support this in the U.S.... the IP of the supply chain is cemented in Asia after 30 years of making U.S. tech products... and the products will go up 3x-4x once implemented after years... being paid by the U.S. consumers/companies.” Ives added, “‘Debacle’ is an understatement for this tariff policy.” The “self-inflicted uncertainty” of the tariffs has “turned the global supply chain upside-down, and U.S. consumers are the ones paying,” according to Ives. He doesn’t expect any tech companies to give guidance on first-quarter conference calls, given all the uncertainty. Still, he recommends owning stocks in Apple (AAPL-4.58%) and Nvidia (NVDA-6.83%) because “despite this massive, near-term uncertainty, it does not change their installed base, technology leadership, and long-term growth opportunities, especially with Nvidia leading the AI industry.” Apple is down 20% since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on the so-called “Liberation Day” on April 2 and 28% year-to-date. Nvidia is down 10% since the recent tariff announcement and 26% year-to-date. Ives said Wedbush will stay fluid. The firm work under the assumption that the tariffs in their current form will stick around for a few months and will adjust its numbers as the tariffs change or remain. The Wedbush analyst recommends tossing out the next few quarters (June and September) and working with new financial models for 2026 for valuations as the tariff situation gets negotiated. Ives said his firm has a worst-, base-, and bull-case framework that it’s using to screen tech stocks; that’s how Wedbush will “navigate this unprecedented situation” and hold investors’ hands over the coming days and weeks. “Market volatility and nervousness has been one of the highest I have seen in 25 years on this job covering tech stocks on the Street,” Ives said. “Now, the question is what is next and how to navigate this Category 5 storm tariff coming to the U.S economy.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Delta, Walmart, Apple: Stocks to watch today

Investors were digesting the latest volley in the U.S.-China trade fight early Wednesday, with a 104% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and other tech goods taking effect overnight. The renewed trade tension added fresh anxiety to a day already packed with earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL-11.28%) and Constellation Brands (STZ-0.05%), worrying signals from Walmart (WMT+0.85%) and Apple (AAPL-4.58%), and a wave of big-bank results on deck. Premarket moves among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were broadly lower Wednesday, with Tesla (TSLA-9.08%) off 1% and Apple slipping 2% in early trading. Amazon (AMZN-5.76%), Microsoft (MSFT-2.75%), and Nvidia (NVDA-6.83%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum. Bond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.” Delta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading. But while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses. Constellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool. Early Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers. Meanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen. Once a national discount heavyweight, Big Lots was delisted from the NYSE late last year and now trades as a penny stock. Its collapse adds to the growing wave of “retail wreckage” — from Red Lobster’s closures to Macy’s and Foot Locker (FL-9.31%), both of which are shuttering hundreds of stores across the country. Together, these developments highlight the pressure facing retailers: rising input costs, unpredictable trade policy, and a consumer base increasingly cautious about spending. The first-quarter results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM-4.19%) and Wells Fargo (WFC-6.32%) land Friday. Analysts will be watching for loan growth, consumer credit quality, and recession contingency plans. With rate cut expectations pushed deeper into the year, margin commentary will be critical. These earnings may also help set the tone for Q2 investor sentiment.

Title: Google's 'Ironwood' TPU aims squarely at the high cost of inference

Time Published: 2025-04-09T12:05:59Z

During its Google Cloud Next 25 event Wednesday, the search giant unveiled the latest version of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the custom chip built to run artificial intelligence -- with a twist. Also: Why Google Code Assist may finally be the programming power tool you need For the first time, Google is positioning the chip for inference, the making of predictions for live requests from millions or even billions of users, as opposed to training, the development of neural networks carried out by teams of AI specialists and data scientists. The Ironwood TPU, as the new chip is called, arrives at an economic inflection point in AI. The industry clearly expects AI moving forward to be less about science projects and more about the actual use of AI models by companies. And the rise of DeepSeek AI has focused Wall Street more than ever on the enormous cost of building AI for Google and its competitors. The rise of "reasoning" AI models, such as Google's Gemini, which dramatically increases the number of statements generated by a large language model, creates a sudden surge in the total computing needed to make predictions. As Google put it in describing Ironwood, "reasoning and multi-step inference is shifting the incremental demand for compute -- and therefore cost -- from training to inference time (test-time scaling)." Also: Think DeepSeek has cut AI spending? Think again Thus, Ironwood is a statement by Google that its focus on performance and efficiency is shifting to reflect the rising cost of inference versus the research domain of training. Google has been developing its TPU family of chips for over a decade through six prior generations. However, training chips are generally considered a much lower-volume chip market than inference. That is because training demands rise only as each new, gigantic GenAI research project is inaugurated, which is generally once a year or so. In contrast, inference is expected to meet the needs of thousands or millions of customers who want day-to-day predictions from the trained neural network. Inference is considered a high-volume market in the chip world. Google had previously made the case that the sixth-generation Trillium TPU, introduced last year, which became generally available in December, could serve as both a training and an inference chip in one part, emphasizing its ability to speed up the serving of predictions. In fact, as far back as the TPU version two, in 2017, Google had talked of a combined ability for training and inference. Also: Google reveals new Kubernetes and GKE enhancements for AI innovation The positioning of Ironwood as mainly an inference chip, first and foremost, is a departure. It's a shift that may also mark a change in Google's willingness to rely on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia as the workhorse of its AI computing fleet. In the past, Google had described the TPU as a necessary investment to achieve cutting-edge research results but not an alternative to its vendors. In Google's cloud computing operations, based on the number of "instances" run by customers, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia chips make up a combined 99% of processors used, versus less than a percent for the TPU, according to research by KeyBanc Capital Markets. That reliance on three dominant vendors has economic implications for Google and the other giants, Microsoft and Amazon. Also: 10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next Wall Street stock analysts, who compile measures of Google's individual lines of business, have, from time to time, calculated the economic value of the TPU. For example, in January, stock analyst Gil Luria of the boutique research firm DA Davidson wrote that "Google would have generated as much as $24 billion of revenue last year if it was selling TPUs as hardware to NVDA [Nvidia] customers," meaning in competition with Nvidia. Conversely, at a time when the cost of AI escalates into multi-hundred-billion-dollar projects such as Stargate, Wall Street analysts believe that Google's TPU could offer the company a way to save money on the cost of AI infrastructure. Also: DeepSeek's new open-source AI model can outperform o1 for a fraction of the cost Although Google has paid chip-maker Broadcom to help it take each new TPU into commercial production, Google might still save money using more TPUs versus the price it has to pay to Intel, AMD, and Nvidia to consume ever-larger fleets of chips for inference. To make the case for Ironwood, Google on Wednesday emphasized the technical advances of Ironwood versus Trillium. Google said Ironwood gets twice the "performance per watt" of Trillium, as measured by 29.3 trillion floating-point math operations per second. The Ironwood part has 192GB of DRAM memory, dubbed HBM, or high-bandwidth memory, six times as much as Trillium. The memory bandwidth transmitted is 4.5 times as much, 7.2 terabits per second. Also: Nvidia dominates in gen AI benchmarks, clobbering 2 rival AI chips Google said those enhancements are supposed to support much greater movement of data in and out of the chip and between systems. "Ironwood is designed to minimize data movement and latency on chip while carrying out massive tensor manipulations," said Google. The memory and bandwidth advances are all part of Google's emphasis on "scaling" its AI infrastructure. The meaning of scaling is to be able to fully use each chip when grouping together hundreds or thousands of chips to work on a problem in parallel. More chips dedicated to the same problem should lead to a concomitant speed-up in performance. Again, scaling has an economic component. By effectively grouping chips, the TPUs can achieve greater "utilization," the amount of a given resource that is actually used versus the amount being left idle. Successful scaling means higher utilization of chips, which is good because it means less waste of an expensive resource. Also: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles That's why, in the past, Google has emphasized Trillium's ability to "scale to hundreds of thousands of chips" in a collection of machines. While Google didn't give explicit details on Ironwood's scaling performance on inference tasks, it once again emphasized on Wednesday the ability of "hundreds of thousands of Ironwood chips to be composed together to rapidly advance the frontiers of GenAI computation." Also: Intel's new CEO vows to run chipmaker 'as a startup, on day one' Google's announcement came with a significant software announcement as well, Pathways on Cloud. The Pathways software is code that distributes parts of the AI computing work to different computers. It had been used internally by Google and is now being made available to the public.

The trade-war selloff took a breather earlier on Tuesday, buoying Big Tech firms including Nvidia (NVDA-6.83%), Tesla (TSLA-9.08%), Meta (META-7.13%), and Microsoft (MSFT-2.75%), after a mixed day on Monday and two especially gnarly days last week wiped $1.8 trillion off the market value of leading tech stocks. The moment’s shifting investor outlook seemed wrapped up in hopes that deals will soon emerge from President Donald Trump’s tariff talks; investors chased that glimmer of light by boosting Nvidia stock by more than 5% earlier in the day. Nvidia then shed most of those gains; it was up 1.4% at around 2:40 p.m. Eastern, while Tesla was down roughly 2%, Microsoft and Meta were mostly flat, Amazon (AMZN-5.76%) was down 0.8%, and Apple (AAPL-4.58%) was down 3.2%. Regarding the president’s as-of-yet unrealized tariff deals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that he thinks investors will “see a couple of big trading partners do deals very quickly.” Just yesterday, Big Tech’s recent losses had the stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL-3.74%) approaching one-year lows. Apple, which relies on factories in China to build its iPhones, is among the tech giants most vulnerable to sweeping tariffs. A temporary workaround for the Cupertino firm may include sending more of its India-built iPhones to the U.S. market to dodge the worst of the president’s tariffs. Temporarily exempt chipmakers and advertising giants (think: Nvidia and Meta) may fare better than hardware-focused companies such as Apple, but no tech giant is invulnerable to the fallout. Tariffs could take a bite out of the corporate ad budgets that firms like Meta subsist on, while tariffs-induced price hikes could slow gadget sales and ultimately hit chipmakers’ bottom lines.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Too Cheap?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Nvidia Corporation logo is seen displayed on a ... More monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why would an investor pay 30 times earnings for Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) when Nvidia stock is trading at 33 times earnings? It wouldn't make much sense, especially when considering these three key points: Some might consider Nvidia a “safe haven,” but its track record during market downturns tells a different story. For example, Nvidia stock dropped more than 65% during the 2022 inflation crisis. In 2020, amid pandemic uncertainty, the stock fell over 35%. Most significantly, during the 2008–2009 financial meltdown, Nvidia shares plummeted by 85%. Clearly, NVDA isn't a safe stock. For more detail, see our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? along with analysis of previous market crashes. That said, Nvidia’s stock has already seen a considerable correction, falling from nearly $150 at the start of the year to below $100. For investors looking for a potentially steadier, high-performing approach, the Trefis High Quality portfoliomay be worth considering. This strategy has delivered over 75% returns since inception, as shown in its HQ performance metrics. If you believe in the continued rise and expansion of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be an attractive long-term play at current valuation levels. Nvidia essentially serves as an “arms supplier” in the AI arena. Investing in Nvidia is not a bet on any one player like OpenAI, Google, or Amazon, but rather on the backbone that supports them all. The AI race is still developing, and companies are pouring in resources. For example, Google’s infrastructure-related capital expenditure is approximately $75 billion, showing the scale of the investment. Despite the optimism, Nvidia does face risks. Earnings could fall short of expectations, or growth might slow from 50% to around 30% as businesses tighten spending. Additionally, clients might pursue more efficient AI models, lessening the need for Nvidia’s chips. Unpredictable events could also negatively impact the stock. These factors suggest that downside risk—as much as 40%—is possible. Selling during such dips could hurt investors more than holding through volatility. Nonetheless, for long-term investors with a 3-5 year outlook who can tolerate swings, Nvidia at today’s levels may be a compelling entry into the AI revolution. Those interested in navigating downturns or potentially gaining from them might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has beaten its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices). Consulting with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets may also be wise. Remember, many fortunes are built by those who stay calm and strategic in volatile markets.

Title: Nvidia stock pops 8% as chip stocks rise on hopes for tariff relief

After taking a beating for the past week, chip stocks climbed Tuesday morning as part of a broader market rally. Nvidia (NVDA-6.83%) shares had lost almost 15% over the previous three trading sessions but had clawed back 8% by midday Tuesday before retreating slightly. Meanwhile, other leading chip makers, including Broadcom (AVGO-8.10%), Intel (INTC-8.89%), Micron Technology (MU-11.79%), Lam Research (LRCX-8.42%), Applied Materials (AMAT-8.96%), Samsung, and Cisco (CSCO-3.52%) were also up Tuesday. Nvidia’s slide accelerated last week after HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded the stock from a “buy” to a “hold,” noting that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Meanwhile, other chip stocks were getting better reviews from analysts. For instance, GuruFocus research shows that Broadcom has received a “Strong Buy” rating from nearly 88% of brokerage analysts. Trump’s trade war had sunk chip stocks as fears over slowing demand and high prices took hold. However, semiconductors are exempt from new tariff rates imposed on a slate of countries, which should insulate chip makers from some tariff turmoil. Also of concern: Data centers planned by major IT companies have been delayed or shelved as uncertainty surrounding ROI increases. Microsoft (MSFT-2.75%) announced yesterday that it has abandoned its $1 billion data center project in Licking County, Ohio, citing a strategic investment review. Data centers are a key driver of chip manufacturing growth. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Worth Buying The Dip?

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp; You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019. Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company. Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates. The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook: January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%. The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will "transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries." Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC. Nvidia announced expanded GeForce Now device support and capabilities at the 2025 CES trade show. Nvidia’s automotive line-up includes a platform for in-vehicle computing plus solutions for training AI driving models and simulating environments for testing. In 2025, the company announced automotive AI partnerships with Toyota, Aurora, Continental, GM, Gatik and Torc. Nvidia expects its automotive business to deliver fiscal 2026 revenue of $5 billion, up from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Alongside these opportunities, Nvidia faces some challenges. Regulatory changes, cheaper AI solutions and in-house chip development top the list. Changing Trump administration policies could pressure Nvidia’s stock price. Reciprocal tariffs, even with semiconductors excluded, could raise input costs and reduce margins. While Huang seems unbothered by the trade war developments, he also said he could move manufacturing to the U.S. if needed. That is a long-term solution. Unfortunately, growth investors are not known for their patience. A transition to domestic manufacturing would impact the NVDA stock price. More concerning than tariffs is the potential for export bans to China and import bans by China. Reports indicate Trump has considered tighter limits on chip sales to China. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators are discouraging sales of Nvidia's H20 chip—a product designed for export to China—because it doesn't meet efficiency standards, according to the Financial Times. The rollout of DeepSeek caused angst for Nvidia shareholders. At issue was the $5.6 million total investment quoted by the AI app’s creator. The price tag seems tiny next to, say, Microsoft's $80 billion AI budget for fiscal 2025. The discrepancy prompted questions about Nvidia's growth outlook. If DeepSeek can do it, why can't big tech spend far less on Nvidia's AI hardware for the same results? Some experts have said the $5.6 million number from DeepSeek is misleading. Still, there will be a time when cost-efficiency enters the AI fray. That could create space for competitors to chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance. Big tech companies don’t want Nvidia to be the only AI chip game in town. It's too risky. They are mitigating that risk by developing in-house solutions. Alphabet (GOOG) recently introduced a collection of lightweight open-source AI models, Meta (META) is testing an AI chip and OpenAI has nearly finalized the design of its AI chip. These solutions will reduce Nvidia's business with existing customers over time. Nvidia will have to improve on performance and price as a result. Nvidia is an attractive, long-term buy right now despite regulatory and competitive challenges. The stock may not return to its pre-Trump growth rates, but it is an innovative, healthy company with a forward-thinking leader—and those qualities usually create shareholder value over time. Like many growth stocks, NVDA is volatile. Its per-share price can fall as quickly as it rises. You can see that dynamic in play for NVDA stock since it went public in 1999. So this stock is best suited for hardy, patient investors and those who already own NVDA and want to reduce their average cost basis. If you don't feel quite ready for NVDA, see this list of best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas. Bottom Line Nvidia is down nearly 30% this year as investors worry about tariffs, trade bans and lower-cost AI models. But the chip designer is not down for the count. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation. After the recent downturn, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is about 32. That compares favorably to other semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Arm Holdings (ARM). Nvidia is a well-run company that can navigate financial downturns and industry shifts. Relative to its history, the company's current valuation is appealing. If you don't mind volatility and believe in the AI promise as well as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now is a good time to buy Nvidia stock. The biggest risks for Nvidia are margin degradation from tariffs, the global impact of tariffs, import and export bans and waning demand if others can replicate DeepSeek's low-power AI model.

OpenAI is reportedly mulling a deal to buy io Products, a hardware startup looking to make an A.I. device, for up to $500 million, The Information reported. io Products, which took shape about two years ago, involves several notable tech figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple (AAPL) designer Jony Ive. It has also attracted the attention of Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The startup took shape after Altman and Ive were introduced by AirBnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky, a close friend of Altman who has previously worked with Ive’s design studio LoveFrom, which Ive launched shortly after leaving Apple in 2019. Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple honing the company’s distinct sleek aesthetic. LoveFrom engineers, many of whom also formerly worked with Ive at Apple, are in charge of building io Products’ consumer device that could aid users in everyday tasks, according to The Information. OpenAI, meanwhile, is supplying the technology. The project’s current employees include the likes of Tang Tan, who previously led iPhone product design, and Evans Hankey, who formerly succeeded Ive to lead design efforts at Apple. It’s unclear whether Tan and Hankey would join OpenAI if a potential acquisition took place, noted The Information. What exactly io Products is working on remains a mystery. The venture has stayed silent on its plans for an A.I.-powered personal product, which could reportedly take the shape of a household device. One thing is for sure: it won’t be a traditional smartphone. “I don’t think you should try to do a better phone,” Altman told Axios of the project last year. io Products is backed by Ive himself and tech investors such as Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded Laurene Powell Jobs. As of last September, the startup was reportedly on track to raise up to $1 billion by the end of 2024. Since its rise into mainstream tech in 2022, OpenAI has made efforts to expand beyond just making A.I. models. In addition to exploring a potential web browser product that would compete with Google, the company is currently finalizing designs for its own in-house A.I. chips in a bid to reduce its dependency on Nvidia (NVDA). OpenAI is hoping to begin mass producing these chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) by next year. TSMC also manufactures chips for Nvidia and Apple.

Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/04/06/tariffs-are-a-recession-and-bear-market-inevitable/

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.
