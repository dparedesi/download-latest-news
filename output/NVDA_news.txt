Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: The 10 Strongest-Performing Mega-Cap Stocks Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/30/the-10-strongest-performing-mega-cap-stocks-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-30T17:53:23Z

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.

September 29, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoRL -- NVIDIA today announced that the open‑source Newton Physics Engine is now available in NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab, along with the open NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.6 reasoning vision language action model for robot skills and new AI infrastructure. Together, these technologies provide developers and researchers with an open, accelerated robotics platform that speeds iteration, standardizes testing, unifies training with on‑robot inference and helps robots transfer skills safely and reliably from simulation to the real world. “Humanoids are the next frontier of physical AI, requiring the ability to reason, adapt and act safely in an unpredictable world,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “With these latest updates, developers now have the three computers to bring robots from research into everyday life — with Isaac GR00T serving as robot’s brains, Newton simulating their body and NVIDIA Omniverse as their training ground.” Newton Opens New Standard for Physical Simulation in RoboticsRobots learn faster and safer in simulation, but humanoid robots — with their complex joints, balance and movements — push today’s physics engines to the limit. Over a quarter-million robotics developers worldwide need accurate physics, so the skills they teach robots in simulation can be executed safely and reliably in the real world. Today, NVIDIA announced the beta release of Newton, an open-source, GPU-accelerated physics engine, managed by the Linux Foundation. Built on the NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD frameworks, and codeveloped by Google DeepMind, Disney Research and NVIDIA, Newton is available now. With Newton’s flexible design and ability to work with different types of physics solvers, developers can now simulate extremely complex robot actions, like walking through snow or gravel and handling cups and fruits, and successfully deploy them in the real world. The latest adopters of Newton are esteemed research labs and universities such as ETH Zurich Robotic Systems Lab, Technical University of Munich and Peking University, robotics company Lightwheel, and simulation engine company Style3D. Cosmos Reason Improves Robot Reasoning for New Open Isaac GR00T N1.6 ModelTo perform humanlike tasks in the physical world, humanoids must understand ambiguous instructions and deal with the long tail of never-before-seen experiences. The latest release of the open Isaac GR00T N1.6 robot foundation model, available soon on Hugging Face, will integrate NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason, an open, customizable reasoning vision language model built for physical AI. Acting as the robot’s deep-thinking brain, Cosmos Reason turns vague instructions into step-by-step plans, using prior knowledge, common sense and physics to handle new situations and generalize across many tasks. Cosmos Reason, downloaded over 1 million times and currently at the top of the Physical Reasoning Leaderboard on Hugging Face, can also curate and annotate large sets of real and synthetic data for model training. Cosmos Reason 1 is now available as an easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for AI model deployment. Isaac GR00T N1.6 now lets humanoids move and handle objects simultaneously, allowing more torso and arm freedom to complete tough tasks like opening heavier doors. Developers can post-train Isaac GR00T N models using the open-source NVIDIA Physical AI Dataset on Hugging Face. Downloaded over 4.8 million times, the dataset now includes thousands of synthetic and real-world trajectories. Leading robot makers such as AeiROBOT, Franka Robotics, LG Electronics, Lightwheel, Mentee Robotics, Neura Robotics, Solomon, Techman Robot and UCR are evaluating Isaac GR00T N models for building general-purpose robots. New Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI Development NVIDIA announced new updates to its open Cosmos WFMs, downloaded over 3 million times, that let developers generate diverse data for accelerating training physical AI models at scale using text, image and video prompts. New Workflow for Teaching Robot Grasping Teaching a robot to grab an object is one of the most difficult challenges in robotics. It is not just about moving an arm but turning a thought into a precise action — a skill robots must learn through trial and error. The new dexterous grasping workflow in the developer preview of Isaac Lab 2.3, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform, trains multi-fingered hand and arm robots in a virtual world using an automated curriculum. It starts with simple tasks and gradually ramps up the complexity. The workflow changes aspects like gravity, friction and the weight of an object, training robots to learn skills even in unpredictable environments. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robots learned grasping using this workflow to significantly improve its manipulation capabilities. Leading robot developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, Skild AI, Solomon and Techman Robot are adopting NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse technologies. Evaluating Learned Robot Skills in SimulationGetting a robot to master a new skill — like picking up a cup or walking across a room — is incredibly difficult, and testing these skills on a physical robot is slow and expensive. The solution lies in simulation, which offers a way to test a robot’s learned skills against countless scenarios, tasks and environments. But even in simulation, developers tend to build fragmented, simplified tests that do not reflect the real world. A robot that learns to navigate a perfect, simple simulation will fail the moment it faces real-world complexity. To let developers run complex, large-scale evaluations in a simulated environment without having to build the system from scratch, NVIDIA and Lightwheel are codeveloping Isaac Lab - Arena, an open-source policy evaluation framework for scalable experimentation and standardized testing. The framework will be available soon. New NVIDIA AI Infrastructure Powers Robotics Workloads AnywhereTo enable developers to take full advantage of these advanced technologies and software libraries, NVIDIA announced AI infrastructure designed for the most demanding workloads, including: NVIDIA Advances Robotics ResearchNVIDIA technologies, including GPUs, simulation frameworks and CUDA®‑accelerated libraries, were referenced in nearly half of CoRL’s accepted papers — with adoption across leading research labs and institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, ETH Zurich and National University of Singapore. Also highlighted at CoRL is BEHAVIOR, a robotic learning benchmark project by the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab and Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform for advancing vision-based tactile robotics, developed by Peking University.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels After Stock Surged 20% Last Week

Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments. The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company. Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring. Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week. Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023. Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range. A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year. Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.

Title: Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. Economists say that’s a bright red flag | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. But while the market’s climb may be inflating their accounts, they are more exposed than ever to a potential market slump. Direct and indirect stock holdings, including in mutual funds or retirement plans, accounted for an all-time high of 45% of households’ financial assets in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. The record-high stock ownership raises red flags about whether a market downturn could hit Americans’ personal finances — especially in an economy with an increasingly fragile labor market and stubborn inflation. The milestone is a product of multiple factors: stocks have hit record highs, boosting the value of holdings; more Americans are directly participating in the stock market; and retirement plans like 401(k)s that invest in the stock market have risen in popularity in recent decades. Record-high stocks are generally good — that lets more people benefit from Corporate America’s gains, especially long-term investors. But it’s not all upside. Because so many people now own and have so much of their money in stocks, the market has more influence on the economy, for good or ill, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “The impact of a stock market melt-up or a meltdown — it goes both ways — is going to be much more impactful across the economy than, say, just a decade ago,” Roach said. Notably, Americans’ stock ownership has surpassed that of the late 1990s, just before dot-com bubble burst, said John Higgins, chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins said in a note to clients. “Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next,” Higgins added. “But the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.” The S&P 500 has rallied 33% since hitting a low point on April 8. The benchmark index is up 13% since January 1 and has notched 28 record highs this year. The AI boom has fueled the market rally this year. Big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have surged, lifting major indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by companies’ market value. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks — including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500’s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Investors are benefiting, but as the S&P 500 becomes increasingly concentrated — the Mag Seven account for 34% of the S&P’s market value — they remain exposed to the fate of a few enormous companies. AI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out It’s not just American households that are holding record levels of stocks. Foreign investors’ share of US stocks also hit a record high in the second quarter, according to Fed data. History shows that when levels of stock ownership are at record highs, the risk of a downturn and the potential for below-average returns increases, according to Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. “Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat,” Anderson said. “Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns.” While the S&P 500 floats near record highs, concerns are also mounting about the emergence of a “K-shaped economy,” in which the richest Americans get even richer while the poorest Americans continue to struggle or get even poorer. That’s in part because the job market, where most Americans make the bulk of their money, is stagnating, while the stock market, which is how wealthy people tend to make their money, is surging. “Those who have a high degree of wealth in the stock market feel like they’re doing extraordinarily well,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. “Those who don’t, who are largely tied to employment as their primary asset, feel much more constrained in today’s society.” That is creating distortions in economic data, too, helping to paint a rosier overall picture than the one many Americans are feeling in their lives. The buoyant stock market is propping up the net worth of the wealthy, fueling their own spending, which in turn has helped propel economic growth, Roach at LPL Financial said. The data reflect that dichotomy: The top 10% of earners (earning more than $353,000 annually) accounted for more than 49% of consumer spending in the second quarter, the highest share on record going back to 1989, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. But underneath the hood, the economy is on shakier grounds: Lower-income Americans are increasingly strained, and if there is a market slump, it could spook the wealthy Americans who have been propping up the economy with their spending. The Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans “The stock market becomes a bigger economic driver when you’ve got that much exposure,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Gordon said while the market’s gains can spur consumer spending, the opposite can be true when the market tumbles. “There is a bigger risk that to the extent you get a protracted downturn in the market, that starts to weigh on household spending, and starts to weigh on the psychology in particular of people up the wealth spectrum,” Gordon said.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Near the end of 2022, a reader wrote in to tell me that my bullish view of the economy at the time was off the mark. From his vantage point, people were struggling, prices were soaring, and wages weren’t keeping up. This reader wasn’t alone—it was around that time that Bloomberg wrote that the chances of a recession in the next year were 100%. So there was zero chance of avoiding one, in other words. We all know what happened next: The economy and stock market took off. That translated into real gains (and high income) for the portfolio of my CEF Insider service. In our equity bucket, for example, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a long-time holding (more than eight years) posted a total return that topped the S&P 500 from the end of 2022 to the time of this writing. Today, we see a very similar situation, with pessimism running high. The difference now is that stocks are hitting all-time highs, causing a lot of investors (maybe you among them) to ponder selling ahead of a coming downturn. We contrarians, of course, know that when the crowd fears something will happen, something else usually does. Which is why ADX remains a buy, even though (and indeed because) the closed-end fund (CEF) holds high-flying tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN), plus strong blue chips in other sectors, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Here’s why I’m so bullish on stocks—and CEFs—like these. A Strong—Yet Hated—Economy First, we need to say upfront that large companies are seeing surging revenue, with 6.2% year-over-year gains, according to the Financial Times. These gains come from across sectors—with one exception: Energy. That’s understandable, and it’s actually good for US consumers and companies except for, well, Big Oil. Moreover, every sector but consumer discretionary is posting accelerating sales—that is, this year’s gains are bigger than last year’s. That’s the first part of the reason why I’m bullish on funds like ADX. But consider also broader retail spending, excluding cars and gas. It’s a key measure, since people buy cars in long cycles and gas is volatile, so both can skew the numbers. Here we see strong demand for goods and services—another plus for the economy. The outlook is positive, too, with the Federal Reserve’s GDPNow indicator, the most up-to-the-minute metric we have, showing growth above 3%, way above beyond Wall Street economists’ estimates. Why are economists—and indeed most investors—feeling dour, then? Let’s take a closer look at this, starting with what might seem like a pretty weird indicator at first. This chart shows wage growth for workers who are neither managers nor business owners over the past 30 years (the dotted line). It stacks that up against the increase of the cost dining out (the solid line). Like I said, a weird one! But stick with me because it shows these workers’ average earnings have risen more than the cost dining out. The takeaway: Average Americans have more money to eat out, and that’s actually a reasonably good barometer of middle-class wealth gains. But there are drawbacks to this chart, mainly that it doesn’t show things like costs for education, healthcare and other basics. All of these are becoming heavier burdens for the lower middle class. And since these people are a big part of the economy, this makes things look tougher for many Americans. Indeed, they are tougher. We can make of that what each of us will, of course, but we always endeavor to stay out of politics here at Contrarian Outlook—and focus solely on what the data is telling us. And that is this: The US economy is growing strongly, even though the lower middle class is struggling. It follows, then, that the rich are driving more corporate sales. This is bad for social welfare, sure, but from an economic perspective, it just means the kinds of things being sold are changing and the number of people buying them is shrinking. Bloomberg has some good data on this, showing that the top 10% of income earners now account for nearly 50% of total consumer spending—a record high. Now, we might worry that if the number of people driving revenue growth keeps shrinking, a pullback would result. And I agree. But wealthy Americans’ share of consumer spending also skyrocketed in the late 1990s, and I know I don’t have to tell you what stocks have done since then. So, no matter where each of us stand on the rich being a bigger part of the economy, this isn’t necessarily bad for business. In fact, in many cases, it can be good for business. But it absolutely can result in higher pessimism overall. And pessimism, as we contrarians know, provides buying opportunities. Which brings me back to ADX, which, despite the S&P 500 levitating higher, has seen its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) widen in the last three months. Today, we have a chance to buy this smartly run CEF for 9% off. That’s partly a hangover from a change ADX made to its distribution in 2024. Under its old scheme, the fund paid minuscule regular dividends and made up for those with a huge end-of-year special payout that varied depending on its NAV performance. Now, ADX targets an 8% annualized payout (based on NAV), paid four times a year. So if NAV rises, so does the payout. That’s much more investor-friendly, and it’s caused ADX’s discount to narrow slightly in the last year or so, but not as much as it should. That’s our chance to buy, as ADX is positioned to benefit from themes like the spread of AI and the resulting build-out of data centers. And we can get in at that 9% discount—thanks again to investor pessimism and misunderstanding. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
