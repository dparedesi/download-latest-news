Bitcoin weakness persists as the BTC price drops to $86,000, alongside a US stock market sell-off and diminishing odds of a 50-basis-point Fed interest rate cut at the next FOMC. Key takeaways: A Q1 2025 fractal and oversold market conditions suggest BTC could consolidate before retesting the $98,000 to $100,000 zone. One analyst made a bold price prediction, suggesting that a rising wedge breakdown could open the door to a deeper correction, potentially reaching $30,000. Bitcoin (BTC) jumped after Nvidia Corp.’s stronger-than-expected revenue outlook helped calm fears of an overheating AI bubble, but the gains quickly reversed as the Dow gave up a 700-point rally to turn negative and US stocks sold off. WHY are markets crashing? Our logical explanation:There is quite literally only ONE headline that can even be partially blamed for such a sudden market crash.At 11:20 AM ET, the US Labor Department said the November and October employment "situation" will be released on… pic.twitter.com/zubNQstd5l Bitcoin fell to a new monthly low of $86,400, and data suggest more downside could be on the way. Bitcoin’s recent pullback is echoing the same bullish reversal structure that unfolded in Q1 2025, said analyst Cas Abbé. Back then, BTC lost momentum near its fresh all-time high, slipped below a key support level and decoupled from a rising stock market before bottoming out in a multi-week accumulation range. Abbé’s chart below shows the pattern resurfaced almost identically in recent months, with the analyst adding that BTC will likely enter “consolidation between $85,000 to $100,000 for 3 to 4 weeks.” More importantly, both corrections were driven by broader macro fears. In Q1 2025, the sell-off was sparked by the US tariff war. This time, the catalyst has been panic over a potential AI bubble, anxieties that weighed heavily on tech stocks and spilled into crypto before Nvidia’s upbeat revenue outlook helped calm markets. The fractal raised Bitcoin’s odds of retesting $100,000 as resistance by year’s end. Analyst BitBull supported the bullish reversal outlook, though his view leans more on the technical structure of Bitcoin’s descending channel and its deeply oversold conditions as of Thursday. BTC traded near the lower boundary of this multi-week downtrend, an area that has repeatedly acted as an accumulation zone during previous corrections. Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory for the first time in months. Related: $90K Bitcoin price is a ‘close your eyes and bid’ opportunity: Analyst Together, BitBull argued, these signals mark potential local bottoms, adding that BTC “could rally toward $98,000 to 100,000” next. Analyst AlejandroBTC took a far more bearish stance, noting that Bitcoin has officially broken down from the large rising wedge pattern he has been warning about for months. In classical technical analysis, a rising wedge breakdown typically marks the end of a major trend, with the measured move indicating a significant decline. In this case, AlejandroBTC argues the structure projects a long-term target near the $30,000 region, a level that aligns with multiple historical support zones on the weekly chart.

Title: Bitcoin's Nvidia-Led Gains Prove Short-Lived, With Price Slumping Back to $88K
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/20/bitcoin-s-nvidia-led-gains-prove-short-lived-with-price-slumping-back-to-usd88k

Continuing with recent patterns, even the most modest of crypto gains were met with waves of selling on Thursday, sending bitcoin BTC$84,629.04 back to $88,000 after a rally above $93,000 just hours earlier. The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%. Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%. Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years. Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum’s ether ETH$2,785.58, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high). A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.

Title: JPMorgan’s ‘Everything Rally’ Ignites After Nvidia’s Q3 Blowout | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in because markets are moving, and not in small ways. What started as another busy week of earnings and economic data has quickly changed into something more significant. Somewhere between Nvidia’s eye-popping numbers and JPMorgan’s latest call, traders are suddenly talking about an “everything rally,” and even Bitcoin miners are waking up to the buzz. JPMorgan’s trading desk forecasts an “everything rally” after Nvidia exceeded expectations with $57 billion in quarterly revenue and a $65 billion guidance, triggering a 5% after-hours surge and adding over $200 billion to the chipmaker’s market value. Nvidia’s impressive earnings report bolstered belief in the AI investment cycle. Gains spread across chipmakers, and Bitcoin rose above $91,000, with risk appetite returning to markets after a multi-day slide. Nvidia projected an even stronger fourth quarter, guiding revenue to $65 billion versus the $62 billion anticipated by analysts. Nvidia’s upbeat report sparked gains in other chipmakers. AMD, Micron, Broadcom, and Intel all climbed in after-hours trading, reflecting optimism for the semiconductor sector. The results reinforced investor confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track despite recent volatility. After the S&P 500 Index fell 3.4% over four days, JPMorgan’s trading desk issued a bullish note. Andrew Tyler reiterated a dip-buying stance, emphasizing stable fundamentals and stating the investment thesis is not reliant on Federal Reserve policy shifts. The bank highlighted Nvidia earnings and the September nonfarm payrolls report as major catalysts for potential new market highs. SETUP POISED FOR AN "EVERYTHING RALLY"JPMORGAN TRADING DESK:"Given that there have not been any changes to the fundamental story, nor does our investment hypothesis rely on the Fed easing, we are dip-buyers. As we look at the two key events this week, (i) Sept's NFP and (ii)… Goldman Sachs mirrored JPMorgan’s optimism. Partner John Flood described the recent market drop as a “real buying opportunity” ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, anticipating a year-end rally. The investment bank stated that hedge funds have de-risked, while discretionary investors remain underweight and are poised to deploy capital. November has been the S&P 500’s weakest month since 2008, with a 3% decline month-to-date. Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher Mining, IREN, and Hut 8 leapt in pre-market trading after Nvidia’s strong guidance. The surge reflected growing acknowledgment of miners’ expanding role in AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. Nonetheless, institutional investors, including Peter Thiel and SoftBank, have recently trimmed their holdings in Nvidia and major AI companies, signaling wariness over high valuations. Peter Thiel reportedly sold his entire position of 537,742 shares in Nivdia.Why? It’s a bubble, they all know it & are cashing out. – Nvidia ALONE = 15% of US GDP.-OpenAi wants a govt bailout. – US Growth is .01% when you remove AI sector. pic.twitter.com/mk3Nc6yBpk A Bank of America survey revealed that 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the primary threat to markets. Global regulators, including the Bank of England and the IMF, warn of risks from potential AI and crypto bubbles. Amidst strong market enthusiasm, investor Michael Burry raised concerns regarding Nvidia’s stock-based compensation. Burry examined financial data since 2018, highlighting a gap between reported earnings and true value creation for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2018, NVDA earned about $205B net income and $188B free cash flow, assuming all cap ex was growth cap ex.SBC amounted to $20.5B.But it bought back $112.5B worth of stock and there are 47 million MORE shares outstanding.The true cost of that SBC dilution… pic.twitter.com/u8VhZyokrB Burry’s analysis suggests stock-based compensation has masked Nvidia’s real earnings strength. The company posted $205 billion in net income and $188 billion in free cash flow since 2018. Despite this, its share count rose by 47 million, even after $112.5 billion in repurchases. The dynamic raises questions about whether headline numbers fully reflect value for shareholders. This debate captures ongoing tensions in market sentiment. While JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs highlight strong fundamentals and structural AI demand, skeptics point to valuation risks and possible headwinds. As investors digest Nvidia’s results and changing economic data, the coming weeks will reveal whether the “everything rally” expectation comes true or volatility persists.

After NVIDIA (NVDA) beat Q3 earnings and issued a strong Q4 outlook, artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) related stocks have surged in pre-market trading. The beat in expectations helped calm recent market jitters sparked by U.S. jobs data delays, fading rate cut expectations, and a 30% pullback in bitcoin from its record high. AI/HPC bitcoin miners have been the biggest beneficiaries of the stellar earnings beat. IREN (IREN) is up more than 8% at about $50, Cipher Mining (CIFR) is up 11% at over $16, and Hive Digital (HIVE) is up more than 6% at $3.28. Broader tech has also bounced, with Invesco QQQ up over 1.5% at $610 and NVIDIA (NVDA) up more than 5%. The strength in tech is supporting the DXY Index, which is back above 100 for the first time since Nov. 5. In addition, Kindly MD (NAKA) reported Q3 earnings after initially delaying results. The company posted $0.4 million in revenue for its medical business, down from $0.6 million in Q3 2024. NAKA recorded an $86 million net loss in Q3 2025, driven by non-cash charges from the Nakamoto merger and unrealized bitcoin losses. As of Sept. 30, NAKA reported $24 million in cash on hand and holds 5,765 BTC purchased at an average price of $118,204 each. The company has deployed 367 BTC for investments including in Metaplanet (3350), leaving 5,398 BTC in treasury as of Nov. 12; it also carries $203 million in convertible notes. NAKA is trading at 0.916 times mNAV, with shares at $0.54, little changed in pre-market.

Nvidia has posted a record quarterly revenue, which has helped dampen fears of an AI bubble and lift crypto and tech stocks. Tech and crypto stocks rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday after chip maker Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations on the top and bottom line, allaying fears of an AI bubble. Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter ended Oct. 26, up 62% from a year ago and beating Wall Street projections of $54.7 billion. The company reported a profit of $31.9 billion, a 65% increase from last year and surpassing analyst expectations. It also gave a higher-than-expected guidance of $65 billion in revenue for its fourth quarter, suggesting the appetite for artificial intelligence isn’t yet slowing down. Concerns of an AI bubble had seen tech shares slide over the past weeks, which saw crypto also dump as investors sold off risky assets, and the broader market was awaiting Nvidia’s earnings as a health check on the AI-heavy tech sector. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) jumped over 5% in after-hours trading on its Q3 earnings to $196 after closing trading on Wednesday up 2.85% to $186.52. The chip maker’s earnings beat helped lift shares across crypto companies after-hours, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) all seeing slight bumps after finishing the trading session down. Crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) was also lifted by 1% in post-trading after finishing the day down 3.7% despite beating Wall Street’s predictions and reporting its strongest quarter since going public in August. Related: 21shares Solana ETF launches amid crash, but flows signal investor interest Big Tech stocks were also up, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) all seeing gains after the bell. Nvidia’s earnings have also helped to buoy Bitcoin (BTC), which has dropped over 10% in the past week amid a wider market rout. Bitcoin fell to a 24-hour low of $88,540 in late trading on Wednesday, dipping below $89,000 for the first time since late April. It has since seen a recovery to around $91,500, coinciding with Nvidia’s earnings announcement and is down 0.6% over the past day, per CoinGecko. Ether (ETH) has also seen a recovery after sinking to around $2,873 on Wednesday, its first time under $2,900 since mid-July. It has climbed back above $3,000 and is down 1.9% on the day.

Fears of an AI bubble took at least a temporary breather after Nvidia (NVDA) reported an earnings beat as well as a strong fourth quarter outlook after the close of U.S. markets on Wednesday. The chipmaker topped Wall Street’s expectations for the third quarter, reporting revenue of $57.01 billion — a 62% jump from a year earlier — as the AI investment boom continues to fuel demand for its chips. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," said CEO Jensen Huang. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially." Shares of the company were higher by 4% in after hours trading at press time. Data center revenue — arguably the biggest source of income for the firm — landed at $51.2 billion — slightly above analyst forecasts of $49.34 billion. As for the all-important outlook, NVDA sees fourth quarter revenue of $63.7-$66.3 billion against Street estimates for just $62 billion. The news for the moment has calmed particularly jittery crypto markets, sending bitcoin BTC$84,629.04 back above $90,000 after having nearly fallen through $88,000 earlier Wednesday. AI-focused crypto tokens like TAO$283.16, Near Protocol NEAR$1.9748, ICP$4.3997 and RNDR$1.7707 all rose 4%-5% following the report. Also on the move are those bitcoin mining stocks that have pivoted to AI infrastructure. These names have been on big runs higher this year, but brutally battered of late on the general tech/crypto selloff combined with fears of an AI bubble. Among the gainers Wednesday evening: IREN (IREN) up 8%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) up 11% and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) up 6%. The results reinforce Nvidia’s position at the center of the artificial intelligence supply chain. Its GPUs are critical for training large language models, powering data centers, and running machine-learning workloads across big tech companies. The firm will hold a conference call at 5pm E.T. as investors are looking for reassurance that the company’s massive bets on AI infrastructure, software tools and next-generation chips are translating into lasting revenue.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble. Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations. “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown. The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The world’s most valuable public company has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders stand to be impacted by Wednesday’s results. Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks. Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market. “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report. At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a $100 billion investment in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back. But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday committed to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants. Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google all indicated in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also laid out at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars. Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Wednesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising 2.9% to lead chip stocks higher ahead of the AI darling's highly anticipated quarterly results after the bell. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.6%. See here for Investopedia's full daily market summary. Shares of GE Vernova (GEV), the energy technology company spun off from GE in April 2024, surged 7.3% after the company announced its first wind repower upgrade agreement outside the U.S. Under the deal, GE Vernova will provide 25 wind repower upgrade kits, used to modernize and extend the operational life of aging wind turbines, to Taiwan Power Company. Constellation Energy (CEG) shares jumped 5.3% after the Department of Energy said it had provided a $1 billion loan to fund the utility company's plan to restart a decommissioned nuclear reactor at the Pennsylvania site formerly known as Three Mile Island. Constellation entered a deal last year with Microsoft (MSFT) to resume operations at the nuclear facility to help power the software giant's energy-intensive data centers. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) reported better-than-expected adjusted profit for the third quarter, and shares of the home improvement retailer climbed 4%. The company highlighted an increase in online sales, strength in its business with professional contractors, and growth in "home services," a program that connects customers with licensed professionals for help with installation and remodeling projects. The strong report from Lowe's came a day after rival Home Depot (HD) missed quarterly earnings forecasts and cut its outlook, citing headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the housing market. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) gained 2.8% to close at an all-time high after the tech giant launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model. Several analysts praised the newest version, saying it competes with state-of-the-art models from competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. Wednesday's move into record territory followed gains earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed a stake in Alphabet. Eversource Energy (ES) stock dropped 12.5%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500, after regulators in Connecticut rejected the utility company's proposed sale of its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. The state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to block the transaction, determining that it failed to meet the proper standards for managerial sustainability. A pair of agricultural giants came under pressure following reports that the Trump administration may delay proposed cuts to incentives for biofuel imports. Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Bunge (BG), which process commodities like corn and soybeans into biofuel, slipped 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

Some "smart money" has been seeing signs of rain—and reaching for the umbrella. Robinhood (HOOD), the company behind the popular retail trading app, last week added to its allocation to T-bills, the short-term Treasury notes considered some of the safest investments around, "to protect some capital," CIO Stephanie Guild said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. "I felt like the market was giving you signs that it was going to sell off a bit," Guild said. As the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, spiked and broad market benchmarks reflected investor jitters, some pros were making moves to shore up their portfolios. Meanwhile, retail investors have started to tiptoe back into some of this year's high-flyers after they took a dip. Institutional investors are sometimes referred to as "smart money"—and the general public "dumb money"—because the former tends to be a step ahead on market pivots. Robinhood's robo-advisor has lately turned more defensive, potentially a caution signal worth heeding. Robinhood Strategies, the March-launched robo-advisor with over $1 billion in assets, added to its healthcare investments in October, according to Guild, and slimmed its holdings in technology. She said investors were right to start questioning the valuations of stocks ginned up on the AI-rally, and that while she believes in the possible benefits of the technology, one has to reckon with the short-term question of how much it'll cost to develop. The company's managed portfolios are also invested in rare earth stocks and industrial defense companies. a nod to the Trump administration's policies. "The Fed matters less than it used to," she said. "I think the President and [the administration's] actions matter a little bit more." The Robinhood CIO also characterized the recent dip as "kinda normal," and observed that retail investors were wading back into the names that had rallied hard and more recently were "hurt the most"—stocks like CoreWeave (CRWV), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META).

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday Wednesday ahead of highly anticipated earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) due after the closing bell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow fell. Shares of the AI chipmaker climbed ahead of what is being widely viewed as the biggest event of this earnings season. Lowe's (LOW) stock surged after the home improvement retailer reported a better quarterly profit than analysts had expected. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares continued their winning streak that began Monday when Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed a stake in the owner of Google and YouTube. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) climbed after the power company received approval for an up to $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. Eversource Energy (ES) shares tumbled after a Connecticut regulator blocked the utility’s plan to sell its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. Shares of Plug Power (PLUG) sank after the maker of hydrogen fuel cells said it would sell $375 million in notes that investors could convert into the firm’s stock. Shares of Valero Energy (VLO), APA (APA), and others in the energy sector declined along with the price of crude, which slid amid concerns about oversupply. Gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded in the red.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s recent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The stock market rally — ﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years. Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue. Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a sell-off in AI stocks over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year. “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN. Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks. “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.” Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price. As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about circular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals. Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive. “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert, CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.” And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy. At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany. Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave. “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

Title: Nvidia’s Earnings Report Arrives Tonight and Its Stock Is Rising Ahead of the News

Nvidia shares are showing signs of life on a critical day for financial markets. The stock was up 2% recently ahead of the release of Nvidia's (NVDA) quarterly results after the closing bell, the most highly anticipated event of the earnings reporting season. Coming into today's session, the stock had lost nearly 15% of its value since hitting a record high in late October. But it's still up nearly 40% for the year, roughly three times the gain of the S&P 500 and trailing only Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) in the Magnificent 7. Hyperbolizing about the importance of Nvidia's quarterly results has become a bit of investor vogue lately. Will they determine the future of the company—currently the world's most-valuable—all humanity, or just the AI trade? Whatever the case, the numbers will be closely watched and the insta-analysis plentiful. There aren't many stocks out there that capture broader attention in the way Nvidia does. That's not just because it's been a powerful gainer, but also because of its substantial weight in the benchmark S&P 500, which means its moves affect the legions whose holdings lean toward low-cost passive investments. Stocks, and particularly tech stocks, have been under pressure lately, as investors have begun to look for cracks in the argument for ever-higher investment in AI technology and offered up some skepticism about the arguably circular nature of investment in the industry. "I think people are really gonna need (CEO Jensen Huang) to explain this circular deal mentality, because I don't think it's stopping anytime soon," said Ben Reitzes, Head of Tech Research at Melius Research, in an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning. Reitzes said investors will want to hear more from Huang on his methodology, the kinds of return on investment Nvidia expects and what he sees in AI usage that gives him confidence investments are good ones. Futures markets indicate that Nvidia's shares could move dramatically in the days after its report, which—in the near term, at least—could determine the path ahead for stocks. LPL Financial on Wednesday said traders anticipate a move of near 7% in either direction, which would represent its biggest reaction since the fourth quarter of last year. Some investors have already moved away from the high-powered stock in various forms, making notable portfolio changes before Nvidia's numbers landed. Softbank recently sold its Nvidia stake, though it said the move was intended to fund investments in OpenAI; Peter Thiel's hedge fund also sold. Today, stock investors are seeing some green in their screens after several days of red. The S&P 500, which has lost ground the past four sessions, was up slightly recently. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also ticked higher, while the SOX index of semiconductor stocks gained more than 1%. (Here's our live coverage of today's trading.) The winter is generally seen as an upbeat season for markets, but a disappointing report or outlook from Nvidia could mean this year is different.

Nvidia’s quarterly results are almost here, and anxiety is running high. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's Fear Index, on Tuesday ended the day just below 25, near its highest level since May, when the market was cooling off from April’s tariff tantrum. The index has risen substantially in the past week after coasting along in the mid-teens throughout the second half of the year. (It was recently a bit below 24; a reading below 20 is generally considered calm.) And CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks seven stock-market metrics to gauge the mood on Wall Street, yesterday fell to its lowest level since mid-April. Six of the seven index inputs were flashing “Extreme Fear” on Wednesday morning, with measures of momentum and market breadth having slumped in recent weeks. Wall Street's mood can have as much of an impact on short-term stock performance as the health of the economy or developments with a specific business. Today investors are largely concerned with the quarterly earnings from Nvidia, due after the bell, which could substantially inform how people feel about stocks going forward. Recent anxiety has centered on AI, with some investors worrying that tech giants are overspending on technology with uncertain commercial prospects. Others argue AI will transform nearly every industry, justifying tech’s massive investments and high stock valuations. The AI bubble debate has been playing out for some time, but it intensified this month. Forty-five percent of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America in November said an AI bubble was the biggest tail risk facing the market, up from 33% last month and just over 10% in September. More than half of those surveyed said AI was already in a bubble. And bullish sentiment among retail investors last week fell to its lowest level since early September, according to the Association of American Individual Investors. Bearish sentiment jumped nearly 13 percentage points, the biggest week-over-week increase since February. The stock market faces a critical test this afternoon when Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings. The AI chip giant's quarterly report has become a must-watch event on Wall Street this year, with its results often treated as a proxy for AI demand and a major driver of the AI rally. AI bubble concerns and some high-profile divestments have dragged down Nvidia's stock this month, but expectations are still high. Analysts predict the huge amounts of capital tech companies are pouring into data centers will underpin another strong quarter for the chipmaker.

Nvidia stock is in focus as November 19 approaches. Investors are watching for Q3 results with expected $54 billion revenue and $1.25 EPS. Michael Burry has reignited market tension with fresh warnings about an AI bubble, huge bearish bets and a cryptic Nov. 25 reveal. Scion’s Q3 filing showed $187.6 million in Nvidia put options and $912 million in Palantir puts. Burry later confirmed owning 50,000 Palantir put contracts at a $50 strike and 10,000 Nvidia puts at $110, signaling major downside wagers.

US stock market today: S&P 500 rose 0.9% and the Nasdaq gained 1.5% on Wednesday, while the Dow added 108 points, or 0.2%, as traders positioned for Nvidia’s Q3 earnings. Nvidia jumped over 3% ahead of results expected to show strong AI-chip demand. Investors hoped the report would ease fears of stretched tech valuations after a four-day S&P 500 slide. New data showed the U.S. trade deficit falling 23.8% to $59.6 billion in August as imports dropped 5.1%. TJX rose 3% on earnings, Plug Power sank 20.6%, and the dollar index hit 99.792, its highest level since November.
