Title: Wildly Violent (and Profitable)

By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 29, 2025 The story of the world’s first IPO is a wild one. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the next hundred years, the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering, giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders.

Could Intel be closer to scoring a deal with iPhone maker Apple? The chipmaker's shares surged Friday as an analyst added fuel to rumors that the iPhone maker could become a new customer for the chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) popped over 10% during Friday's shortened trading session to lead gains on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. (Read Investopedia's daily markets coverage here.) The likelihood of Apple (AAPL) becoming a new customer for Intel "has recently improved significantly," TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, citing industry surveys, posted on X Friday, suggesting that Intel could start shipping Apple processors as soon as 2027. A deal with Apple could boost confidence in a turnaround for Intel, which still faces persistent worries about its ability to secure long-term commitments to its manufacturing business. Apple and Intel did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. Shares of Intel have roughly doubled in value this year after a flurry of recent deals, including a partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). Still, they remain well off their historical highs as the company is still working to convince investors regarding a sustainable turnaround in its business. One of those challenges continues to be securing new customers for its manufacturing operation. The deal with Nvidia did not include commitments to Intel's foundry, raising speculation about whether the relationship could expand later or if the lack of foundry commitments could point to troubles convincing customers. A deal with former Intel customer Apple could go a long way in helping assuage those concerns. Shares of Apple rose a bit less than 0.5% on Friday.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry's group chat is going off. The investor of "The Big Short" fame invited all of his paid Substack subscribers to a group chat on Friday, and it quickly led to hundreds of replies ranging from memes to questions for Burry. This month, Burry pivoted from running a hedge fund to publishing a newsletter named "Cassandra Unchained." It has amassed more than 97,000 subscribers since it launched on Sunday. "This is a conversation space exclusively for paid subscribers—kind of like a group chat or live hangout," reads Burry's introductory post. "I plan to post updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion." The first reply on the chat reads: "I think Dr. Burry just broke Substack." Another early response jokes about Burry's disclosure this week that he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir stock: "I think Dr Burry is going to make more money from Substack than his NVDA and pltr puts 🤣" A third poked fun at a potential spike in traffic to Substack. "Someone pray for substacks backend engineers." "It's gonna be legendburry!!" one subscriber wrote, while another noted: "This chat is gonna be nuts." "Bro don't allow anyone to start threads. This a spam fest," one concerned poster added. Other subscribers rushed to post memes, videos, and even photos of Black Friday crowds. The questions to Burry ranged from who the next chair of the Federal Reserve might be, to how an 80-year-old should invest to prepare for a crash, to how the dollar stacks up against other currencies. Burry resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence, and has wasted no time issuing numerous warnings of an AI bubble and taking aim at key players such as Nvidia and Palantir. The investor, who has 1.6 million X followers, is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the US housing bubble that triggered a global financial crisis, and for issuing dire pronouncements of crashes and recessions. He became famous in financial circles after his bet against the subprime mortgage market was featured in author Michael Lewis' book "The Big Short," and actor Christian Bale played him in the movie adaptation.

Title: TPUs vs. GPUs and why Google is positioned to win AI race in the long term

Hey everyone, As I find the topic of Google TPUs extremely important, I am publishing a comprehensive deep dive, not just a technical overview, but also strategic and financial coverage of the Google TPU. Topics covered: The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The difference between a TPU and a GPU? Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Gemini 3 and the aftermath of Gemini 3 on the whole chip industry Let’s dive into it. The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The story of the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) begins not with a breakthrough in chip manufacturing, but with a realization about math and logistics. Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load. At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare. This sparked a new project. Google decided to do something rare for a software company: build its own custom silicon. The goal was to create an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designed for one job only: running TensorFlow neural networks. Key Historical Milestones: 2013-2014: The project moved really fast as Google both hired a very capable team and, to be honest, had some luck in their first steps. The team went from design concept to deploying silicon in data centers in just 15 months—a very short cycle for hardware engineering. 2015: Before the world knew they existed, TPUs were already powering Google’s most popular products. They were silently accelerating Google Maps navigation, Google Photos, and Google Translate. 2016: Google officially unveiled the TPU at Google I/O 2016. This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects. The difference between a TPU and a GPU? To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture. The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads. A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array. The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck). In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”). It loads data (weights) once. It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers. The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory. What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data. Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking: They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs) It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip. Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks. The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule. For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do. Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways. The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data: TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7. Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA & others), the summary of the results is as follows. Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho. A Former Google Cloud employee: »If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome. The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.« source: AlphaSense Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs: »TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%« This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7. Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads). There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail: »If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage. In the long run, if I am thinking I need to write a new code base, I need to do a lot more work, then it depends on how long I’m going to train. I would say there is still some, for example, of the workload we have already done on TPUs that in the future because as Google will add newer generation of TPU, they make older ones much cheaper.For example, when they came out with v4, I remember the price of v2 came down so low that it was practically free to use compared to any NVIDIA GPUs. Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.« source: AlphaSense Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs: »I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.« We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment: »When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.« What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU. A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia: »The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia« In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium). Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely. Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs The main problem for TPUs adoption is the ecosystem. Nvidia’s CUDA is engraved in the minds of most AI engineers, as they have been learning CUDA in universities. Google has developed its ecosystem internally but not externally, as it has used TPUs only for its internal workloads until now. TPUs use a combination of JAX and TensorFlow, while the industry skews to CUDA and PyTorch (although TPUs also support PyTorch now). While Google is working hard to make its ecosystem more supportive and convertible with other stacks, it is also a matter of libraries and ecosystem formation that takes years to develop. It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example). The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well: »Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies. Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in. I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there. With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.« source: AlphaSense These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible. A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization. Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC. The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future). While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part. Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs. As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it. I believe outside of TPUs, the only real hyperscaler shot right now is AWS Trainium, but even that faces much bigger uncertainties than the TPU. With that in mind, Google and its cloud business can come out of this AI era as a major beneficiary and market-share gainer. Recently, we even got comments from the SemiAnalysis team praising the TPU: »Google’s silicon supremacy among hyperscalers is unmatched, with their TPU 7th Gen arguably on par with Nvidia Blackwell. TPU powers the Gemini family of models which are improving in capability and sit close to the pareto frontier of $ per intelligence in some tasks« source: SemiAnalysis How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Here are the numbers that I researched:

Title: European Fintech Draws in Investors Seeking Refuge From Wall Street’s AI Bubble (Dmytro Spilka)

Time Published: 2025-11-26T20:52:23Z

As fears on Wall Street mount over the sustainability of the AI boom, Europe’s fintechs are showing their worth. Recently, WIRED author Brian Merchant spoke to University of Maryland economists Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch, who devised their own scale for assessing whether certain innovations led to a market bubble. The economists analyzed 58 historical examples of tech bubbles and broke them down to their core components to create a scale from one to eight, where eight is the most likely to predict a bubble. Looking at factors like uncertainty, pure plays, novice investors, and narratives around commercial innovations, Goldfarb concluded that the AI bull run is a fully fledged eight. While this doesn’t confirm that we’re in a bubble, it shows that all the hallmarks are present. Billionaire Peter Thiel recently offloaded his entire stake in leading AI stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), according to 13F filings by Thiel Macro LLC. The total sell-off amounted to 537,742 shares in the chipmaker in Q3. Michael Burry, the investor who inspired The Big Short, also opened short positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting that each stock is set to decline in value. The outlook for Wall Street AI firms is becoming increasingly clouded as concerns over a growing bubble mount. But in Europe, there’s a more optimistic tone surrounding the continent’s fintech sector. Could European fintech be an antidote to the artificial intelligence bubble? Let’s take a deeper look at a market that’s gathering momentum: European fintech is growing at a rapid pace. Forecasts suggest that the continent’s Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market size is set to expand from a value of $2.46 billion in 2024 to $18.32 billion by 2033, representing a CAGR of 25.2%. This expected growth comes despite the recent news that leading UK-based fintechs Revolut and Wise are reportedly eyeing listings in the United States. “The jewel in the crown of European fintech is Adyen (AMS: ADYEN), which has a capitalization of €43.04 billion ($49.9bn) and provides flexible cross-border payment solutions for merchants at scale,” said Iván Marchena, Senior Economist at global brokerage brand Just2Trade. “Crucially, Adyen’s client list spans a wide range of sectors and features names like Uber, Netflix, and Spotify. At a time when there are tangible concerns over the self-funding cycle of AI giants on Wall Street, we’re seeing more fintechs build a sustainable client pool that could help to ensure their longevity.” Platforms like Klarna, which serve more than 100 million customers in 17 countries, are an example of the immediate success that many European fintechs have found in immediately accessing major international markets with their services. There are signs that Europe’s fintech ecosystem is gathering momentum. Flatpay, which facilitates card payments for SMBs, recently reached a value of $1 billion. The startup has already sought to take on its larger rivals by introducing a flat transaction rate for merchants to use its card terminals and point-of-sale systems. Impressively, the Danish startup has claimed that it has grown from 7,000 customers in April 2024 to 60,000 today. Flatpay’s own valuation has also grown exponentially and is now valued at €1.5 billion ($1.75bn). Given its high growth rate, CEO and co-founder Sander Janca-Jensen is now targeting annual recurring revenue (ARR) to solidify Flatpay’s emergence into a profitable European fintech platform. Europe is also becoming a key location for blockchain innovations in the fintech landscape. MQube, a platform that tokenizes mortgage debt by converting financial assets into digital tokens and recording them on a shared ledger, has now tokenized £1.3 billion ($1.7bn), underlining its position as a driving force for securing mortgages using blockchain technology. As blockchain and digital currency technology become increasingly intertwined with fintech, Europe has an opportunity to use its leading position in the ecosystem to introduce cutting-edge financial tools and services to drive further growth throughout the ecosystem. This helps to ensure a pipeline for innovation, even as leading domestic players like Revolut and Wise remain attracted to the prospect of US listings. At a time when suspicions over the longevity of the AI boom are continually coming into question, Europe’s melting pot of innovative fintechs can be a major draw for investors who are seeking exposure to stocks with higher growth potential as AI investments receive mixed levels of sentiment. Given that fintech solutions are finding adoption in a more frictionless manner, it’s reasonable to expect European firms to achieve sustainable growth that can help them find profitability and scalability in the future. Whether the artificial intelligence boom is in a bubble or not, Wall Street investors can find plenty of opportunities throughout Europe’s melting pot of fintech innovators, and these tech firms could offer some resilience in the face of uncertainty in AI.

Title: Coffee Break: Nvidia’s Narrative Breaking Down?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/nvidias-narrative-cramer-burry-alphabet-tpus-druckenmiller.html
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:49Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. As a horrible old Man who was licensed to run a collection agency for more than a decade ( I actually specialized in second and third placement debts, including corporate debt) I look at the Money flows. And while NVIDIA is not as blatant a scam as WeWork was, the financial relationships between NVIDIA and its “Customers” are Peculiar, to say the least. I’m reminded of Keyne’s saying that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, regarding the short sellers. Since Sam Altman’s ultimate contribution to society and business is going to be individualized sex porn, the only real question for the business world is, what is the monetary value as a percentage of GDP? I assume we can take OpenAI being worth $500B to some investors based on his penultimate contribution of individualized non-sex porn for all ChatGPT users’ needs for companionship and flattery as a starting point for computing the value of his ultimate contribution.

Title: 10 Datapoints for Thanksgiving
URL: https://ritholtz.com/2025/11/10-datapoints-for-thanksgiving/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:14Z
Full Content:
November 26, 2025 2:00pm by Barry Ritholtz It’s that time of year again when families gather to feast on bountiful harvests and to give thanks for all of our blessings. This year, skip the “Vibes” and instead focus on market data. Don’t lose sight of nuances and shades of grey; they don’t make for great memes, but they do lead to a better understanding of what’s going on. Here are ten nuanced, slightly contrarian ideas for you to chew over: 1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market higher for years to come. Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time. My favorite takes on AI have come from Derek Thompson and Timothy Lee, who looked into the 12 main arguments Pro & Con, and Benjamin Riley, who aims to “help people understand human cognition and artificial intelligence.” 2. INFLATION: Everything costs more this year — except for the Turkey. The largest fiscal stimulus since World War 2 led to the largest inflation surge since the 1970s. The rate of price increases rose by 9% (peaking June 2022) before falling back to 3% nearly as quickly. There were numerous causes of inflation, but the top of the list was the pandemic supply issues and the huge fiscal stimulus. People confuse the rate of price change with prices. We had high inflation; today, we have low(ish) inflation, but we still retain higher prices. Everything is much more expensive today, even with inflation way down. Low Inflation and High Prices are not mutually exclusive. CPI Inflation is in the 2-3% range today, but it is ticking upwards, creating difficulties for those on the FOMC who want to cut rates. 3. SUPPLY & DEMAND: We may not have structural inflation as we did in the 1970s, but we do have a structural imbalance in supply and demand of many critical goods and services. A few significant examples: Until supply catches up with demand, those prices will remain high. And that is before we get to health care and education costs. 4. ENERGY: The inflation of the 1970s was structural, caused in large part by the Arab Oil Embargo. In contrast, the United States is a net energy exporter today. In the 1970s, energy accounted for about 10% of the average household budget; the Chicago Fed found it peaked at nearly 14% in the early 1980s. Household energy costs are about half of those levels today (5-6%), even as energy consumption has increased significantly. Every power-hungry device, from automobiles to HVAC systems to appliances, is now many times more efficient than in the past. The wildcard is increased demand from power-hungry data centers… 5. CRYPTO CRASH: Given the embrace of crypto by the President (and POTUS’s family), much of Bitcoin 2025 gains can be attributed to this administration’s policies. We should not be surprised by the correlation between the President’s political fortunes / approval ratings, and the price of Bitcoin. The President has had a terrible month; from the election thumping to the fallout with MTG to losing multiple legal cases (Tariffs at SCOTUS, Comey / James case dismissals), it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has suffered a 30% crash this month as well: 6. TARIFFS: Are fascinating: They cause temporary inflation spikes and permanent higher prices. There is no getting around it – any additional tax on imported goods is a source of increased prices. And as we have seen before, even domestic producers will raise prices (Greedflation) if they believe consumers won’t balk. The good news: If the Supreme Court arguments were anything to go on, many of the Tariffs are likely to get struck down. 7. RATE CUTS: You can make a solid case either way – inflation remains stubborn at (or over) 3%, but there are signs of labor market softness, slowing consumer sales, and mediocre sentiment. Expectations had fallen to a ~20% chance of a rate cut – until yesterday’s poor data. Now, we are back to an 80% chance of a December cut. Beyond that is anyone’s guess… 8. BUBBLES: By definition, it takes a crowd to create a bubble. Can you recall the public, the media, or even the Fed identifying a bubble on a timely basis? (Me neither). Asked differently, can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational? If your answer is yes, then it’s likely not a bubble. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the AI bubble debate is Alphabet (GOOGL) passing Nvidia (NVDA) YTD returns: : 9. RECESSION: People hate inflation, but the alternative was a deep and long-lasting pandemic recession. We avoided a 10-12% unemployment rate, but the cost was 9% inflation. Consider the alternative, had both the Trump and Biden admins not cranked up the fiscal spend, people would have been furious at the failure to do anything1. It’s a Lose/Lose; whatever choice got made, half the population would have been furious. As angry as people are over high prices, they would have been even angrier at a do-nothing government letting an ugly recession take hold. 10. VALUATIONS: The Mag 7 remains pricey, even as Nvidia slides 13% off its highs. Its expensive, but it also generates $57 billion in quarterly revenues! Some sectors are extremely overpriced, others are more reasonable. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — is at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, but not ridiculous. Nuance is your friend. Safe travels!
