Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI+11.72%) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.56% GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

A majority of Big Tech stocks were on the rise Wednesday after former President Donald Trump won his reelection bid against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Google (GOOGL+1.64%) parent company Alphabet’s shares were up over 3% after the market open, while Amazon (AMZN+1.12%) shares were up over 2% — hitting a record intraday high since a peak in July. Microsoft (MSFT+0.93%) and Apple (AAPL+1.85%) shares rose minimally by around 1% and 0.2%, respectively. Meta (META+3.48%) was the only Big Tech company to see its shares fall; they dropped around 1.3%.

Apple is just behind at $3.41 trillion. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 3% on Wednesday. The chipmaker counts U.S.-based Nvidia and Apple as its major customers. But during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast before the election, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. The president-elect also said he would impose tariffs on Taiwan’s chips and called the Biden administration’s U.S. Chips and Science Act “so bad.” Intel (INTC+3.85%), which is expecting the largest Chips Act package so far (almost $20 billion in funding and loans), saw its shares rise over 4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 1,300 points at the market open, while the S&P 500 index rose 1.9%, and Nasdaq futures were up 1.8%.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Title: What the Latest Dow Shakeup Could Mean

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This week, two new stocks are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above). One way to look at index changes, especially on such a popular index, is as a driver or indicator of sentiment. Stocks added to the blue-chip index could gin up some positive sentiment, while those eliminated might get the stocks off some people’s radars. I could argue the data above supports this interpretation. New stocks in the index underperformed and have been less likely to beat the index than those kicked out of the index. I’m focusing on the data since 2010. Based on the analysis, perhaps wait at least a month then take a look at the two stocks recently eliminated, INTC and SHW. Sign in to access your portfolio

Super Micro Computer (SMCI+11.72%) will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday after market close, following a series of recent challenges. Most recently, the AI hardware company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned over disagreements about Super Micro’s governance practices and board independence. Additionally, Super Micro is facing a potential delisting from the Nasdaq, having received a non-compliance letter in September. The company has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance — or risk being delisted for the second time in five years. Super Micro shares rose 1% to $26.25 on Tuesday afternoon, nearly 80% below their March peak of $123. The company announced a stock split earlier this year that was popular among investors. The company is set to report earnings on Tuesday for the fiscal quarter ending September 2024. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $0.75, up from $0.28 in the same quarter last year. In the previous quarter, Super Micro missed EPS expectations by $0.19, triggering a sharp drop in its share price the following day. Revenues are projected to reach $6.52 billion, representing a 207.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.56%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit following the accusations. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: Nvidia and Apple keep taking turns at the top of the world

Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL+1.85%) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%. Apple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week. Nvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT+0.93%) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February. Nvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. The U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations. In October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML+2.44%) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” The U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.

Title: University A.I. Programs See Massive Enrollment Surges Thanks to ChatGPT

In 2018, the University at Buffalo became one of the first schools in the world to establish a master’s program focused on A.I. The technology “wasn’t a big craze” at the time, Kemper Lewis, dean of the university’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, told Observer, with the program’s enrollment seen as “slow and steady for a little while.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The program is classified as a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on A.I. and provides a foundational background in A.I. and relevant subsets like machine learning, deep learning and advanced artificial neural networks. The degree opened for enrollment in the spring of 2020 and counted five students in its inaugural semester. That number has since risen more than twentyfold, with the university counting 103 students in the program this fall. “It was a great investment now that we look back on it,” said Lewis. A portion of this surge can be attributed to the mainstream breakthrough of A.I. following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said Lewis, who noted a “decent jump” in enrollment in connection to the chatbot’s release. But the program’s more significant surges occurred in relation to local initiatives like Empire A.I., a $400 million statewide research consortium unveiled by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year. The University at Buffalo is part of the new public-private research center and plans to build an A.I. supercomputing center on campus valued at $250 million. “I think there’s a lot of Google searches going on right now about A.I. degrees, Buffalo, and they’re finding our master’s program from all over the world,” said Lewis. The University at Buffalo isn’t the only school embracing A.I. into its degree programs. Schools like Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University and MIT were also early adopters, while the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year made history as the first Ivy League school to offer an undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s in A.I. Carnegie Mellon, which established its A.I. undergraduate degree in 2018, has also seen a rise in interest. While its 2019 enrollment totaled 53, the program has reliably counted more than 100 students annually since 2021. Oregon State University’s graduate A.I. program grew from 15 students in its inaugural 2021 class to 62 last fall, and MIT’s A.I.-related undergraduate major counted 300 students this year compared to just 37 in 2022. A.I.-related undergraduate and master’s degree conferrals have risen by 120 percent since 2011, according to a 2023 report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, while A.I.-related Ph.D. conferrals have increased by 33 percent during that time. At the University at Buffalo, the school’s A.I. degree takes between 12 to 18 months to complete and has sent off alumni to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. The school is in the process of bolstering the program through initiatives like Advancing Top 25: Faculty Hiring, which has helped add more than 200 faculty members researching A.I. Such research is needed as the program’s subject matter continues to shift, according to Lewis. “We’re constantly working on improving the degree and making sure it continues to be relevant,” he said. Lewis added that its efforts are starting to pay off as people grasp the relevance of A.I. and begin perceiving it as a valuable sector in higher education. “I think students around the world are starting to realize, okay, this is here to stay,” he said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Weekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a "crushing response" to Israel's strikes. Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. "Trump trades" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. "Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023," Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees "tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a "bitcoin national stockpile" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Read more here. Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output. Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — "a bit above typical" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: "The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible." Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. "Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC "erred" in its ruling, adding the company is "evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions." Talen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Perplexity, an AI search company, wants you to use artificial intelligence to track election results. The company launched its Election Information Hub on Friday to offer AI-generated answers to questions you have about elections. The hub provides summaries of candidates and their policies — with somewhat vague descriptions — and offers information about local ballot initiatives. “People deserve a clear, easy way to find the information they seek, and few topics are as consequential as elections,” the company said in a statement. “We want to do our part to support an informed electorate, so we’ve built the election hub on Perplexity’s answer engine: an entry point for understanding key issues, voting intelligently, and tracking election results.” The company told The Verge it’s partnering with the Associated Press and Democracy Works to gather its data, and Perplexity cites Wikipedia in many of its entries. “We selected domains that are non-partisan and fact-checked, including Ballotpedia and news organizations. We’re actively monitoring our systems to ensure that we continue to prioritize these sources when answering election-related queries,” Perplexity’s spokesperson said. The company, which has backing from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%), has previously been accused in a WIRED investigation of: making things up, often inaccurately summarizing topics, and even attributing fake quotes to real people. WIRED dubbed the site a “bullshit machine.” But Perplexity believes its election hub will not have similar problems. “We want to make it as simple as possible to receive trusted, easy-to-understand information to inform your voting decisions,” the company said. “For each response, you can view the sources that informed an answer, allowing you to dive deeper and verify referenced materials.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 200 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility. By afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 203 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.16% and 0.10%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR-1.30%) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) shares rose over 1% on Monday as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.85%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-1.41%) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL+1.85%) and Bank of America (BAC-1.41%), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: A Nvidia partner's stock surged because Nvidia wants chips faster

An Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) partner in South Korea saw its shares surge Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker wants chips faster. SK Hynix’s South Korea–listed shares closed up almost 6.5% after SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won told reporters that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the company to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. Chey, speaking at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, added that Nvidia is still struggling to fulfill chip demand but that the two are working together on the shortage, Bloomberg reported. Huang requested that SK Hynix provide samples of its HBM4 chips earlier than expected, Chey said. In October, SK Hynix said it expected to supply customers with the new HBM chip, which Nvidia needs for its artificial intelligence chips, by the second half of 2025. Chey said both Nvidia and SK Hynix “are on the same page” about HBM4’s schedule, according to Bloomberg. The South Korea-based chipmaker’s shares are up 37.1% so far this year. The company also unveiled a 16-layer HBM3E at the summit that it said will be with customers early next year. SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said the company will release the next-generation HBM5 and HBM5E sometime between 2028 and 2030. In October, SK Hynix reported record revenue, operating profit, and net profit, “achieving best-ever quarterly performance” in the third quarter on demand for its memory chips for AI technology. “SK Hynix has solidified its position as the world’s No.1 AI memory company by achieving the highest business performance ever in the third quarter of this year,” Kim Woohyun, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said in a statement. “We will continue to maximize profitability while securing stable revenues by taking flexible product and supply strategies in line with market demand.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia is about to replace Intel in the Dow

Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) shares rose 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.85%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Nvidia, often hailed as an “AI darling,” has seen substantial gains throughout the year, driven by its advancements in AI chip technology. The company’s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming year, bolstered by expanding interest and investment in artificial intelligence — a field where Nvidia remains a clear leader. Nvidia’s in-demand Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s most advanced generative AI models, have propelled the company to record-high quarterly results and a $3 trillion valuation. The chipmaker’s next-generation Blackwell AI chip platform was launched in March and has seen a large surge in demand. The stock split Nvidia announced earlier this year also boosted popularity and growth. The company’s share price has surged by 173% so far this year — and by 193% in the past year. In the past five years, the stock has seen an astronomical 2,498% rise. In contrast, Intel has lagged in the AI boom and missed key opportunities. For example, Intel decided to pass on investing in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, which has since revolutionized AI applications and reached a valuation of around $80 billion. Intel’s stock has suffered, dropping over 53% this year alone, highlighting the challenges the company faces as it tries to catch up with more agile competitors such as Nvidia.

With 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is on pace for its fifth quarter of earnings growth in a row as it rebounds from the 2023 earnings recession. In other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+ decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month, and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a "crushing response" to Israel's strikes. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the AI chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also rose on Monday amid rising oil prices. Investors are focused on this Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential elections, followed by a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policy makers will announce a rate cut of 25 basis points following the meeting. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report shows that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other countries said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Title: NVIDIA Starts Diverting Orders Away From Super Micro Computer (SMCI) As A Potential Delisting And DOJ Investigation Loom Large

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is NVIDIA's third-largest customer. Additionally, in what is a testament to the heretofore symbiotic relationship between these two entities, SMCI's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. Now, however, it appears that NVIDIA has had enough of Super Micro Computer's near-constant headaches, and is deliberately trying to create some much-needed distance. *NVIDIA HAS BEGUN REDIRECTING ORDERS FROM SUPER MICRO COMPUTER TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS $NVDA $SMCI $DELL $HPE — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) November 4, 2024 To wit, Digi Times is reporting today that NVIDIA has begun redirecting its orders that were originally placed with Super Micro Computer to other suppliers. This development comes as SMCI is now contending with allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, the exodus of its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Super Micro Computer's travails began in August when Hindenburg Research detailed instances of alleged accounting fraud and corporate governance malfeasance in a detailed report. SMCI then delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, presumably in a bid to undertake an internal review. Do note that under the prevailing statutory requirements, SMCI's annual report had to be filed by the 30th of August. Meanwhile, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. As per Hindenburg Research's anecdotes, Super Micro Computer engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. Finally, do note that the Nasdaq exchange recently warned Super Micro Computer of a potential de-listing action should it fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. That punitive action could come as soon as the 20th of November. Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post earlier today, Super Micro Computer has negotiated major changes to its loan agreement with Cathay Bank, with the firm now required to furnish audited financial statements by the 31st of December as opposed to the earlier covenant, which posited the 28th of October as the deadline for furnishing these financial documents.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.
