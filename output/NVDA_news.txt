Title: Watch These AMD Price Levels as Stock Slides Amid New U.S. Rules on Chip Exports to China

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Visits Beijing Amid Tightened Chip Export Control

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is walking a delicate line. Like other major tech companies, the chip giant is currying favor with the Trump administration by making massive investments in U.S. infrastructure. At the same time, Nvidia is trying to preserve its lucrative ties to international markets like China, as evidenced by Huang’s latest visit to Beijing. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A day after Nvidia said it will take a $5.5 billion quarterly hit from new U.S. export license requirements affecting its H20 GPU—designed specifically for the Chinese market—Huang arrived in Beijing today (April 17) to meet with local official and tech leaders, including DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang. During a meeting with Hongbin Ren, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which invited Huang, the Nvidia CEO expressed hopes for continued cooperation with Beijing and emphasized the importance of China to Nvidia’s business, according to local media reports. The visit comes at a particularly tense moment in U.S.-China relations, as both countries remain locked in an escalating trade war. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump enacted 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with a 125 percent levy on American goods. The Trump administration also recently announced new curbs that will require export licenses for semiconductors shipped to China. In an SEC filing this week, Nvidia said the license requirement would cost the company $5.5 billion in additional charges, which will be reflected in its first-quarter earnings report on May 28. In response to earlier restrictions under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, which prohibited the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, Nvidia developed the H20 chip to comply with the new rules. Last year, China accounted for approximately 13 percent of Nvidia’s global revenue. The news license requirement will also affect AMD’s MI308 chips and could cost the company up to $800 million. On April 14, Nvidia pledged to invest up to $500 billion over the next four decades to produce chips in the U.S. The Trump administration hailed the announcement as evidence of “the Trump effect in action,” aligning with the President’s agenda to strengthen domestic manufacturing. Other tech giants like OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) have also made similar investments in recent weeks. Huang’s pledge doesn’t mean he has quite given up on China. In addition to his meeting with Ren, he reportedly met with Lifeng He, China’s vice premier for economic policy, who reiterated the country’s openness to foreign investment and trade partnerships. Huang also met with DeepSeek’s Wenfeng Liang to discuss next-generation chip designs that meet U.S. regulatory standards, according to the Financial Times. DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley earlier this year by unveiling a pair of A.I. models that rivaled the performance of leading U.S. systems—despite being developed at a fraction of the cost. The surprise launch prompted renewed calls from American tech leaders for stricter export controls to slow China’s momentum in A.I.

Title: ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman Derisks, Says Stock Market Volatility Will Be Here for a While

Steve Eisman says he’s taking a wait-and-see approach to the stock market right now. In a new interview with CNBC, the famous investor notes he’s dialed down the risk in his personal portfolio. “I’m waiting. I think we’re going to have volatility for quite a while. The Trump Administration has set up a situation where they’re going to be negotiating with multiple countries on multiple issues. It’s not going to take a couple of weeks, it’s going to take a few months, so I think, for the time being, volatility’s going to be here for a while.” Eisman, who’s known primarily for betting against the housing market prior to the American subprime mortgage crisis, says stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apollo Global Management (APO) have “strong long-term fundamentals” and are primed to make investors money over multi-year timeframes, though he’s less certain about the shorter term. “I would not even hazard a guess as to what any stock will do over the next few months, simply because we’re in the type of market where… there’s only one variable that matters, and right now the variable that matters is the president of the United States, and I can’t handicap that right now.” In terms of NVIDIA specifically, the famed investor says it’s only “the early innings of the AI revolution,” and he predicts the tech giant still has room to grow.

Title: Nvidia has lost $250 billion worth of market cap in almost an instant

Time Published: 2025-04-17T19:10:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to fall after the company reported that it would take a $5.5 billion hit due to export controls implemented by the Trump administration. After Thursday’s stock drop, Nvidia has lost more than $250 billion in market cap value since Tuesday. The chipmaker’s stock fell by as much as 4% on Thursday after plunging 7% the day before. Nvidia remains the third-largest U.S. company by market cap. On Tuesday night, the company announced the $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China, citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The chips were developed to comply with Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China. Jefferies (JEF) analysts said in a Wednesday note that the H20 ban was expected — but that the size of it wasn’t. On Thursday, Stifel (SF) analysts said they maintain confidence in Nvidia’s long-term growth, even amid these Trump-imposed restrictions. While short-term volatility is a possibility, the analysts said the company’s overall growth trajectory is strong and reliable. Analysts for the investment banking company added that the situation underscores the current global trade war policies and the effect they have on the tech industry. Dutch semiconductor company ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales slightly below forecasts and flagged the “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions, warning that new tariffs and restrictions could weigh on its outlook for this year — and next. Stifel analysts noted that Nvidia’s decision to take such a large charge indicates a possible lack of confidence that the necessary export licenses will be granted by the current presidential administration or that no further regulations will be imposed. Still, analysts upheld their “buy” rating and a price target of $180.00 for the company. According to InvestingPro data, Nvidia maintains a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating exceptional financial strength. Meanwhile, the New York Times (NYT) reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went to Beijing to meet with Chinese trade officials. According to state media, Huang emphasized his company’s commitment to the foreign market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” But there could be trouble for Huang back home: The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s business in Asia, focusing on whether the company violated export rules, particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Wedbush Securities said in a note Thursday morning that the chip ban was the “first shots fired” in a potential trade war and said that Nvidia and other U.S. tech companies are “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why New China Chip Export Curbs Could Affect Far More Than Just Nvidia, AMD

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) "Rising AI restrictions are likely to impact other key AI-levered computing, networking and optical stocks (AVGO, AMD, MU, ARM, MRVL, COHR, LITE) and raise concerns around enhanced restrictions in other areas," Bank of America analysts said following the news from Nvidia. Like Morgan Stanley analysts, they added Nvidia's write-down indicates a "low probability of future licenses" to circumvent the new restrictions, and that AI diﬀusion rules set to take effect in May could further limit sales of American AI hardware to a broader set of countries. Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Thursday, "We expect hardly any tech companies to give guidance over the next month given this Twilight Zone backdrop. While the Nvidia news is concerning it's not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides before cooler heads prevail and negotiations in some form can begin to play out over the coming weeks/months."

Title: Nvidia's CEO went to China and promised to 'unswervingly serve the Chinese market'

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT) reported. The H20 — a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions — had become central to the company’s China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia’s stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday. While in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia’s commitment to the market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” Back in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules — particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips. As Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” The firm called the chip ban the “first shots fired” in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7–10%. While the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year — over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar. And with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang’s balancing act — between regulatory compliance and global expansion — just got significantly harder.

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Boeing (BA) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China. The broader tech sector continues to grapple with geopolitical fallout, regulatory uncertainty, and earnings jitters. The Nasdaq remains down about 15% year to date. As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and recent earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. In a speech Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment, and warned that Trump’s tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth. He also suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be extra relevant as some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut interest rates — and, failing that, now hopes to deflect blame for the economic fallout from its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. You don’t need to pinpoint every flickering motive to call out the vibe.

Bear in mind that reports in recent days indicated that Intel and TSMC had apparently reached an understanding to constitute a JV that would then manage Intel's US-based fabs. The arrangement would have also roped in other chip designers such as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple. For its part, TSMC would have retained a 20 percent stake in the JV, financed via its in-kind contribution of technology and expertise. The Taiwanese fab giant, however, has now clearly denied any possibility of just such an outcome. Citi, of course, has remained skeptical of a JV between TSMC and Intel from the beginning, going on to declare: "We do not believe TSMC operating/forming a JV with Intel would work given differences in manufacturing and operations."

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 7% Wednesday after the company said it’s set to take a $5.5 billion charge as a result of U.S. restrictions on exports of its AI chips to China. The company said via a regulatory filing that it would be required to have an export license to sell its popular H20 chips to China amid concerns they could be used by Beijing to build a supercomputer. The development caught market watchers off guard, given Nvidia designed the H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to comply with Biden-era chip export curbs on advanced chips the former administration thought could be used by foreign adversaries. Nvidia shares have staged a modest recovery above this month’s low but have lost about a firth of their value since the start of the year as of Wednesday’s close amid uncertainty over Washington's trade policies and big tech AI spending. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching out for. After attracting buying interest near the lower trendline of a falling wedge pattern last week, Nvidia shares rallied sharply before running into selling pressure near the pattern’s top trendline. It’s worth noting that although the stock fell sharply in Wednesday’s trading session, the price formed a doji, a candlestick pattern suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. Let’s identify key support and resistance levels on Nvidia’s chart that investors may be monitoring. Nvidia shares fell 6.9% to close Wednesday's session at $104.49. Further selling in the stock could initially see the price revisit support around $96. This area may attract buyers near last year’s prominent March twin peaks, a location on the chart also situated just above this month’s tariff-driven low. The bulls’ failure to defend the April low could trigger a larger drop to the $76 level. Investors may look for buy-and-hold entry points in this region near last April’s notable swing low. A volume-backed breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s top trendline could drive a move to around $130, currently just above the 200-day moving average. The shares may face overhead resistance in this area near the August peak and December trough. Finally, buying above this level could see Nvidia shares climb to $150. Investors may decide to lock in profits at this price near several peaks that formed on the chart just below the stock’s record high set in early January. This area also aligns with a projected measured move price target that calculates the depth of the falling wedge in points and adds that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, adding $40 to $110 forecasts an upside target of $150. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: Traders Expect a Big Netflix Stock Move After Earnings—Here’s How Much

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

Title: Nvidia could be hit hard by the new chip export license. Analysts warn the big decision is still to come.

Wall Street analysts had some choice words for the latest shake-up to Nvidia's regulatory landscape — "disruptive," "surprise," and "abrupt," just to name a few. Bernstein analysts went so far as to say "The Trump rug remains in full effect." New rules regarding Nvidia's Chinese business surprised many company stakeholders this week. On Tuesday, after market close, the company announced that it had been informed that the Trump administration would require a new license for all accelerated chips shipping to China and a small group of other countries including Russia. Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves in the first quarter, which ends on April 27. "Based on our discussions, this is effectively a ban," wrote UBS analysts in a note to investors Tuesday. Even those analysts unwilling to read the disclosure as a full-on ban said any licensing process is likely to be lengthy, so revenue from Nvidia's H20 chip, the one the company designed specifically to meet Biden-era export restrictions, is expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future. "This is not a ban; it's a licensing requirement, but again, the inventory write-down suggests that the company is not optimistic about being granted licenses," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. At the time of writing, the regulation has not appeared in the Federal Register or the Department of Commerce website, so all analyst reactions are related to Nvidia's disclosure. The company's stock was down more than 7% from Tuesday to Wednesday market close. A spokesperson from Nvidia declined to comment. Nvidia priced the charges it will likely incur in the first quarter (ending April 27) at $5.5 billion. However, there was no warning about the company's first-quarter results, which will be announced on May 28. Though China sales will almost certainly be lower than expected, several analysts expect the company may still be able to meet revenue targets for the first quarter. "Given the strong demand for H200 chips since DeepSeek's launch, we think NVDA could offset somewhat lost China H20 revenues," BNP Paribas analysts wrote. The same analysts estimated Nvidia's China data center business constitutes 10% to 12% of Nvidia's total revenue. UBS suggested earnings per share would fall by 20 cents, and Morgan Stanley analysts expect 8% to 9% of data center revenues to disappear in the near term. A decrease in ongoing sales to China was already expected. Restrictions on what the company is allowed to sell to China are not new. Hence the company has attempted to reduce its reliance on that market over the last two years. Since the H20 is only relevant to the Chinese market, oversupply won't affect Nvidia's sales of any other chips, Morgan Stanley wrote. Since Nvidia's chips are the most expensive in existence, and buyers still keep lining up, tariffs are less of a concern than export restrictions, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Beyond the Chinese market, there are bigger potential impacts looming. The Biden administration's AI diffusion rules are set to go into effect next month — and could have an even more material impact on Nvidia if enacted as is, since they restrict exports to many more countries such as Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, UAE, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and India. Since the White House and Nvidia have demonstrated some cooperation this week, with the Trump administration celebrating the company's announcements around expanded US manufacturing, analysts have converged around a theory about what comes next. "We are optimistic that the company's demonstrably good relationship with the government, as Trump tweeted yesterday, will mitigate these concerns," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Jump to

Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year. One thing after another seems to be knocking shares lower. If the pressure isn't coming from competing Chinese AI models, it's being applied by President Trump as he announces more tariffs on Nvidia-adjacent industries. And that's not to mention the stock's status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a headlining member of the vaunted Magnificent 7. Its rapid increase over the past few years has only been rivaled by the major declines it experiences during times of market turbulence. Nvidia's rocky year continued on Wednesday as shares fell as much as 7% after the company said that it expects to take a $5.5 billion earnings hit because of Chinese tariffs levied by Trump. The stock is now down 20% year-to-date and off about 30% from its January peak. Those losses far outpace the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 12% in 2025. Investors in Nvidia — formerly the market's foremost darling — are being forced to come to grips with the stock's position at the epicenter of multiple headwinds. "Nvidia has found itself in the middle of many crosscurrents this year," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI on Wednesday. Detailed below are three major forces holding Nvidia back in 2025: This ultimately boils down to Nvidia's sheer size and weighting in major indexes, which has resulted from the stock's eye-watering climb in recent years. Now that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the clear leader of the AI-chip revolution, expectations have been ratcheted up. After all, Nvidia has grown its annual revenue by 383% since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. "The stock has become a victim of its own success where the exponential growth following the release of ChatGPT became unsustainable given how large sales had become," Hickey said. The first warning of a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth rate was the release of a large-language model from China, named DeepSeek. DeepSeek was significant in that it utilized nuanced efficiency gains that helped boost performance on par with mainstream GPTs, all while using significantly less computing power. The swift decline in Nvidia stock was almost fully recovered in mid-February, as tech CEOs spun DeepSeek's efficiency gains as a reason why AI should evolve even quicker. But that recovery was severely dented after Nvidia reported its earnings results in late February, which included guidance that failed to meet Wall Street's most lofty projections. After earnings, tariff worries weighed on Nvidia stock, as it sources most of its chips from overseas factories, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor. And now investors have to worry about the US government levying export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market as a watered down AI GPU. All together, this weighs on Nvidia's ability to continue to post eye-popping growth rates in its upcoming earnings release. "We acknowledge that this news could impact NVDA Jul-Q guide's ability to beat street estimates comfortably," analysts at Citi said in a note on Wednesday. These issues only compounded investor worries about the stock. "The stock's problems started way before DeepSeek and tariffs, but these issues haven't helped as they only create more doubt as to the sustainability of its torrid growth rate," Hickey said. Jump to

Title: Nvidia stock slumps 6% as a U.S. ban on China AI exports means a $5.5 billion hit

The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty. Nvidia (NVDA), America’s third-largest company by market cap, said Wednesday it will take a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China — citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The H20 had been engineered to comply with earlier Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China, one that was quickly gaining traction. But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing. Let’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched. Meanwhile, ASML (ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026. Investors didn’t like what they saw. Nvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry. In a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks. Markets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. Stock market data growth chart graph investment finance analysis fintech financial district The roller-coaster ride in the stock market has continued as Friday’s seemingly positive reduction in the tariffs on electric goods was deemed temporary on Sunday before the markets opened on Monday. China’s new policy on not accepting the delivery of Boeing jets was announced early Tuesday which is a further sign that the trade war is heating up not cooling down. The new rhetoric on pharma tariffs once again does not exhibit any real understanding of what new tariffs might mean. In a Tuesday CNBC interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb revealed that “just about 70% of the key ingredients, key chemicals substances that are used” to make widely used generic drugs all originate in China. The former FDA commissioner is concerned that additional tariffs on some of these life-saving drugs, which have a small profit margin, will not continue to be produced because of new tariffs. After the market closed a regulatory filing by NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) reported that the U.S. “required required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip. The chip giant said the move would result in $5.5 billion in charges to the company.” In early trading Wednesday, NVDA was down 6.7%, trading at $104.71, which is down $7.50 from Tuesday’s close. There had been some signs over the past few days that the rebound was losing upside momentum. QQQ Many stocks opened very strong on Monday as there were hopes the Friday announcement of lower tariffs might be a sign of progress. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) had closed on Friday at $454.40 but opened Monday at $464.46 which was 2.2% higher. QQQ closed Monday at $457.48 which was well below the day’s high of $465.05. On Tuesday the QQQ again traded above the 20-day EMA at $461.32 but closed at $457.99. There is chart support to watch at Friday’s low of $441.33 with the monthly S1 pivot support at $446.74. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line has just rebounded back to its EMA as it closed just above it on Tuesday. If the QQQ A/D numbers are negative on Wednesday it will be consistent with a failing rally. There is support at the recent lows and then the uptrend, line c. The AD line needs to move above the downtrend, line b, to signal that the correction in QQQ is over. The relative performance (RS) is above its EMA but it needs to overcome the recent highs to indicate that QQQ is now leading the SPY. A move above the major RS resistance at line d is needed to confirm that QQQ is leading the SPY. NYSE Composite The loss of upside momentum was also evident on the more broadly-based NYSE Composite as it closed Tuesday on the day’s lows as it failed to reach the 20-day EMA at 18,663. There is further chart resistance, line a, in the 18,818 area. The NYSE McClellan Oscillator rallied from the April 8 low to close Tuesday just above zero at +10.59. The downtrend at line b needs to be overcome to signal a further rally. The NYSE All Advance/Decline line has rallied from the recent lows but is still below the declining EMA and resistance at line d. The downtrend in the A/D line (line c) needs to be overcome to turn it positive. The S&P futures are down 41 points at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is an hour before the open. Of course, it is the close that will be more important. If the stock market declines sharply for a few days it will hopefully encourage a return to sanity before there are new ill-informed tariffs on the pharma industry.

U.S. stock futures moved lower Wednesday as investors braced for another wave of geopolitical and earnings headlines. S&P 500 futures were down 0.5%, the Dow hovered near flat, and Nasdaq futures dropped more than 1%. These are the stocks most likely to shape the news. Wednesday’s most closely watched story centers on Nvidia (NVDA), which disclosed a $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its H20 AI chips to China. The Biden administration initially crafted the export controls to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Nvidia’s stock is down nearly 7% premarket. Given its rank as the third-largest U.S. company by market value, the fallout could be wide. Chipmaker AMD (AMD) also dropped 6% premarket. In Europe, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — just below analyst forecasts — and warned of “greater uncertainty” ahead due to U.S.-China tariff tensions. ASML, which makes the machines used in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, has seen its shares fall 28% over the past year despite the AI boom. Also before the bell, Abbott Labs (ABT) — best known for developing medical devices and consumer health staples like Pedialyte and Ensure — topped earnings expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $1.09 on 4% reported sales growth. Its medical devices segment surged nearly 13% on an organic basis, driven by a 20% jump in diabetes care. Shares were flat to modestly higher ahead of the open. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, posted first-quarter core FFO of $1.27 per share, meeting estimates. The company, which operates logistics hubs crucial to global supply chains, highlighted solid rent growth and occupancy, even as leasing cooled. “Policy uncertainty is making customers more cautious,” said CEO Hamid Moghadam. “But over the long term, limited new supply and high construction costs support continued rent growth.” Kinder Morgan (KMI), CSX (CSX), and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are also set to report Wednesday, offering insight into the state of energy infrastructure, transportation, and regional banking. Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook, while March retail sales data is due, offering a window into consumer behavior before the latest tariff escalation. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains stuck in “extreme fear” territory, a mood that’s proven hard to shake since President Trump’s early April tariff blitz. And for good reason: Even amid the hard numbers of earnings season, markets are now being driven less by fundamentals and more by policy whiplash. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often delivered via social media or offhand remarks — are proving just as influential as official actions. It’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%. Nvidia stock plunged 6.9% after the company disclosed a $5.5 billion charge linked to fresh U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips — once seen as a workaround for earlier bans. AMD (AMD) stock fell 7.4%, while chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7% after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates and warned that escalating tariffs could cloud the global outlook through 2026. Markets retreated further as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were “highly likely” to fuel inflation, and suggested the central bank will wait to gauge their effect before lowering interest rates. “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,” Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. “The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.” “For the time being,” Powell said, “we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Still, there were bright spots. Abbott Labs (ABT) beat earnings expectations with adjusted EPS of $1.09 and double-digit organic growth in its medical device division, including a 20% jump in diabetes-related products. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, met forecasts with $1.27 in core FFO and reaffirmed guidance — but noted rising customer caution. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales surged 1.4% in March, the biggest monthly gain since January 2023. Analysts said shoppers likely pulled purchases forward to avoid tariff-driven price hikes: Think customers loading up on TVs and T-shirts at Costco (COST) ahead of potential price pain. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains in “extreme fear” territory — a mood that’s proven hard to shake since Trump’s tariff barrage earlier this month. It should come as no surprise: This is a market increasingly driven by policy whiplash, cheerleading soundbites, and dropped hints of trade negotiations. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often via social media or offhand remarks — are proving as influential as official announcements. And it’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. The most closely watched story Wednesday centered on Nvidia (NVDA), the third-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and its disclosure of the $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its AI chips to China. The Biden administration originally designed export controls to curtail China’s access to advanced AI chips — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Also in chips news, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion, or about $8.7 billion— below analyst expectations — and flagged “greater uncertainty” ahead due to tariffs. ASML, which makes the machines essential to high-end chip manufacturing, has seen its stock fall by 28% over the last year despite the AI boom. Elsewhere, China posted 5.4% GDP growth for the first quarter, matching the prior quarter. Export activity surged as companies rushed to ship goods ahead of expected new U.S. tariffs. Beijing also named a new top trade negotiator. Still, market watchers seemed to see little clarity ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Nvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Nvidia on Tuesday said it will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance. Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth. The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have “deteriorated sharply” owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy. The H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China. “Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions…now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.” The H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek’s successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China. Nvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for 13% of sales last year. The chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter’s earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” Analysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a “strategic blow” for Nvidia’s efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers. “This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it’s Nvidia,” they said in a Tuesday research note. The industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. The US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia’s H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD’s MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters. “The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying. Nvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing. While the Trump administration’s imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note. Since DeepSeek’s R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips. In the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek’s reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country’s tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks. DeepSeek, along with many of China’s established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia’s H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm. The performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia’s is expected to widen, Wang said, because of “Nvidia’s superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,” even as DeepSeek’s rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware. The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the WTO. The WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs — especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas. The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs. In North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise. With the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming. “While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” he said. In 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment, high-bandwidth memory chips and products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China’s technological progress. Related article Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia Before Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month. The series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness. Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote in a company blog post that the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress “in jeopardy” and threatened to “derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Global markets are again under pressure following an escalation in U.S.–China trade tensions, with investors fleeing to havens and tech stocks taking a beating. Gold surged over 2% on Wednesday to top $3,300 per ounce and set a new record high. The dollar weakened further, and Nasdaq futures pointed to a rough day ahead for Wall Street. On Tuesday, the White House announced tariffs of up to 245% on Chinese imports in response to China’s retaliatory measures and bans on exports of key strategic materials, including rare earth elements, gallium and germanium that are used the production of high-speed computer chips. The move follows an Executive Order launching an investigation into national security risks tied to U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals. Markets reacted swiftly. The Dollar Index (DXY) fell back below 100, signaling reduced investor confidence in the U.S. currency. Meanwhile, the euro strengthened to $1.13 and the yen to 142 per dollar. Equities struggled. Nasdaq futures dropped more than 2%, with tech stocks particularly hard hit. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell 7% pre-market after the company disclosed that new U.S. export controls on AI chips to China would cost it $5.5 billion in lost revenue. The announcement raised concerns of broader earnings hits across the semiconductor industry , which relies heavily on Chinese demand. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped slightly to $83,000 following the news, reflecting its stronger correlation with U.S. tech stocks rather than acting as a safe-haven asset like gold.
