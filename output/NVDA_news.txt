This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In what is nothing short of a bombshell commentary that again places Intel's future within the raging vortex of uncertainty, TSMC has declared during its earnings call that it is not interested in forming a JV with other companies. $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $MU $NVDA $TSM's solid Q1'25 earnings & guidance push markets higher overnight.üü¢ EPS: $2.14 vs $2.07 est (beat by $0.07) üü¢ Rev: $25.77B vs $25.72B est (beat by $0.05B) üü¢ Q2 Rev Guidance: $28.4B-$29.2B vs $27.2B est.üü¢ Gross Margin: 58.8% vs 53% y/y pic.twitter.com/vPSPxGOT3W ‚Äî Gigavest (@Gigavest) April 17, 2025 For the benefit of those who might not be aware, TSMC has just published solid results for its Q1 2025 earnings, managing to post a trifecta of beats: exceeded consensus expectations on its top-line and bottom-line metrics as well as raised its revenue guidance for the ongoing second quarter by $1.6 billion (based on the midpoint of the provided range). TSMC earned $25.77 billion in revenue in Q1 2025 vs. expectations of $25.72 billion. For Q2, the fab giant expects to haul in revenues of between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion (midpoint at $28.8 billion). Based on its visible H1 run-rate, TSMC is now on course to haul in $109 billion in revenue for FY 2025. ‚Äî U.S. TARIFFS HAVE NOT IMPACTED CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; DEMAND CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED SUPPLY. ‚Äî PRODUCTION YIELDS IN ARIZONA ARE COMPARABLE TO TAIWAN FACILITIES; EXPECTED THAT 30% OF 2NM CAPACITY WILL EVENTUALLY BE BASED IN ARIZONA.$TSM $TSMC https://t.co/zHGRc3jKs6 ‚Äî Michael Kitara (@MichaelKitara) April 17, 2025 Elsewhere, while conceding to the US tariff-related uncertainties ahead, TSMC says that it has seen no impact on customer behavior so far. As a refresher, NVIDIA and AMD have both disclosed significant financial hits from the Trump administration's recent imposition of licensing requirements on the H20 and MI308 GPUs, respectively. Also, TSMC has declared that the yields in its Arizona fab are now comparable to those in its Taiwan facilities. Moreover, the company now intends to increase its investments in the US to $165 billion. TSMC has no intention of forming joint ventures or engaging in technology sharing with other companies. (@intel) Puts stop to all the rumors. $TSM ‚Äî Parv sharma (@Parv_S) April 17, 2025 Of course, the most critical comment to come out of TSMC's earnings call was its refusal to enter into any JV or technology transfer agreements with other companies, read Intel. Bear in mind that reports in recent days indicated that Intel and TSMC had apparently reached an understanding to constitute a JV that would then manage Intel's US-based fabs. The arrangement would have also roped in other chip designers such as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple. For its part, TSMC would have retained a 20 percent stake in the JV, financed via its in-kind contribution of technology and expertise. The Taiwanese fab giant, however, has now clearly denied any possibility of just such an outcome. Citi, of course, has remained skeptical of a JV between TSMC and Intel from the beginning, going on to declare: "We do not believe TSMC operating/forming a JV with Intel would work given differences in manufacturing and operations."

Title: Traders Expect a Big Netflix Stock Move After Earnings‚ÄîHere‚Äôs How Much
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/traders-expect-a-big-netflix-stock-move-after-earnings-here-is-how-much-11716319

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday‚Äôs report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix‚Äôs report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. ‚ÄúThe market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,‚Äù wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated‚Äîor "cheapest"‚Äîpost-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock‚Äôs post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating and $1,150 price target‚Äîamong the highest on Wall Street‚Äîand expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

Title: Nvidia could be hit hard by the new chip export license. Analysts warn the big decision is still to come.

Wall Street analysts had some choice words for the latest shake-up to Nvidia's regulatory landscape ‚Äî "disruptive," "surprise," and "abrupt," just to name a few. Bernstein analysts went so far as to say "The Trump rug remains in full effect." New rules regarding Nvidia's Chinese business surprised many company stakeholders this week. On Tuesday, after market close, the company announced that it had been informed that the Trump administration would require a new license for all accelerated chips shipping to China and a small group of other countries including Russia. Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves in the first quarter, which ends on April 27. "Based on our discussions, this is effectively a ban," wrote UBS analysts in a note to investors Tuesday. Even those analysts unwilling to read the disclosure as a full-on ban said any licensing process is likely to be lengthy, so revenue from Nvidia's H20 chip, the one the company designed specifically to meet Biden-era export restrictions, is expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future. "This is not a ban; it's a licensing requirement, but again, the inventory write-down suggests that the company is not optimistic about being granted licenses," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. At the time of writing, the regulation has not appeared in the Federal Register or the Department of Commerce website, so all analyst reactions are related to Nvidia's disclosure. The company's stock was down more than 7% from Tuesday to Wednesday market close. A spokesperson from Nvidia declined to comment. Nvidia priced the charges it will likely incur in the first quarter (ending April 27) at $5.5 billion. However, there was no warning about the company's first-quarter results, which will be announced on May 28. Though China sales will almost certainly be lower than expected, several analysts expect the company may still be able to meet revenue targets for the first quarter. "Given the strong demand for H200 chips since DeepSeek's launch, we think NVDA could offset somewhat lost China H20 revenues," BNP Paribas analysts wrote. The same analysts estimated Nvidia's China data center business constitutes 10% to 12% of Nvidia's total revenue. UBS suggested earnings per share would fall by 20 cents, and Morgan Stanley analysts expect 8% to 9% of data center revenues to disappear in the near term. A decrease in ongoing sales to China was already expected. Restrictions on what the company is allowed to sell to China are not new. Hence the company has attempted to reduce its reliance on that market over the last two years. Since the H20 is only relevant to the Chinese market, oversupply won't affect Nvidia's sales of any other chips, Morgan Stanley wrote. Since Nvidia's chips are the most expensive in existence, and buyers still keep lining up, tariffs are less of a concern than export restrictions, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Beyond the Chinese market, there are bigger potential impacts looming. The Biden administration's AI diffusion rules are set to go into effect next month ‚Äî and could have an even more material impact on Nvidia if enacted as is, since they restrict exports to many more countries such as Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, UAE, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and India. Since the White House and Nvidia have demonstrated some cooperation this week, with the Trump administration celebrating the company's announcements around expanded US manufacturing, analysts have converged around a theory about what comes next. "We are optimistic that the company's demonstrably good relationship with the government, as Trump tweeted yesterday, will mitigate these concerns," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Jump to

Title: Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year

Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year. One thing after another seems to be knocking shares lower. If the pressure isn't coming from competing Chinese AI models, it's being applied by President Trump as he announces more tariffs on Nvidia-adjacent industries. And that's not to mention the stock's status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a headlining member of the vaunted Magnificent 7. Its rapid increase over the past few years has only been rivaled by the major declines it experiences during times of market turbulence. Nvidia's rocky year continued on Wednesday as shares fell as much as 7% after the company said that it expects to take a $5.5 billion earnings hit because of Chinese tariffs levied by Trump. The stock is now down 20% year-to-date and off about 30% from its January peak. Those losses far outpace the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 12% in 2025. Investors in Nvidia ‚Äî formerly the market's foremost darling ‚Äî are being forced to come to grips with the stock's position at the epicenter of multiple headwinds. "Nvidia has found itself in the middle of many crosscurrents this year," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI on Wednesday. Detailed below are three major forces holding Nvidia back in 2025: This ultimately boils down to Nvidia's sheer size and weighting in major indexes, which has resulted from the stock's eye-watering climb in recent years. Now that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the clear leader of the AI-chip revolution, expectations have been ratcheted up. After all, Nvidia has grown its annual revenue by 383% since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. "The stock has become a victim of its own success where the exponential growth following the release of ChatGPT became unsustainable given how large sales had become," Hickey said. The first warning of a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth rate was the release of a large-language model from China, named DeepSeek. DeepSeek was significant in that it utilized nuanced efficiency gains that helped boost performance on par with mainstream GPTs, all while using significantly less computing power. The swift decline in Nvidia stock was almost fully recovered in mid-February, as tech CEOs spun DeepSeek's efficiency gains as a reason why AI should evolve even quicker. But that recovery was severely dented after Nvidia reported its earnings results in late February, which included guidance that failed to meet Wall Street's most lofty projections. After earnings, tariff worries weighed on Nvidia stock, as it sources most of its chips from overseas factories, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor. And now investors have to worry about the US government levying export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market as a watered down AI GPU. All together, this weighs on Nvidia's ability to continue to post eye-popping growth rates in its upcoming earnings release. "We acknowledge that this news could impact NVDA Jul-Q guide's ability to beat street estimates comfortably," analysts at Citi said in a note on Wednesday. These issues only compounded investor worries about the stock. "The stock's problems started way before DeepSeek and tariffs, but these issues haven't helped as they only create more doubt as to the sustainability of its torrid growth rate," Hickey said. Jump to

Title: Nvidia stock slumps 6% as a U.S. ban on China AI exports means a $5.5 billion hit

The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), America‚Äôs third-largest company by market cap, said Wednesday it will take a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China ‚Äî citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The H20 had been engineered to comply with earlier Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China, one that was quickly gaining traction. But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy ‚Äî and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing. Let‚Äôs rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn‚Äôt allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge ‚Äî and markets flinched. Meanwhile, ASML (ASML+1.37%), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of ‚Ç¨7.7 billion ‚Äî slightly below forecasts ‚Äî and flagged ‚Äúgreater uncertainty‚Äù due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026. Investors didn‚Äôt like what they saw. Nvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD+2.02%) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry. In a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) analysts said the H20 ban was expected ‚Äî but the size of Nvidia‚Äôs write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks. Markets may have priced in some pain, but they haven‚Äôt seen the last punch. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. Stock market data growth chart graph investment finance analysis fintech financial district The roller-coaster ride in the stock market has continued as Friday‚Äôs seemingly positive reduction in the tariffs on electric goods was deemed temporary on Sunday before the markets opened on Monday. China‚Äôs new policy on not accepting the delivery of Boeing jets was announced early Tuesday which is a further sign that the trade war is heating up not cooling down. The new rhetoric on pharma tariffs once again does not exhibit any real understanding of what new tariffs might mean. In a Tuesday CNBC interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb revealed that ‚Äújust about 70% of the key ingredients, key chemicals substances that are used‚Äù to make widely used generic drugs all originate in China. The former FDA commissioner is concerned that additional tariffs on some of these life-saving drugs, which have a small profit margin, will not continue to be produced because of new tariffs. After the market closed a regulatory filing by NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) reported that the U.S. ‚Äúrequired required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip. The chip giant said the move would result in $5.5 billion in charges to the company.‚Äù In early trading Wednesday, NVDA was down 6.7%, trading at $104.71, which is down $7.50 from Tuesday‚Äôs close. There had been some signs over the past few days that the rebound was losing upside momentum. QQQ Many stocks opened very strong on Monday as there were hopes the Friday announcement of lower tariffs might be a sign of progress. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) had closed on Friday at $454.40 but opened Monday at $464.46 which was 2.2% higher. QQQ closed Monday at $457.48 which was well below the day‚Äôs high of $465.05. On Tuesday the QQQ again traded above the 20-day EMA at $461.32 but closed at $457.99. There is chart support to watch at Friday‚Äôs low of $441.33 with the monthly S1 pivot support at $446.74. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line has just rebounded back to its EMA as it closed just above it on Tuesday. If the QQQ A/D numbers are negative on Wednesday it will be consistent with a failing rally. There is support at the recent lows and then the uptrend, line c. The AD line needs to move above the downtrend, line b, to signal that the correction in QQQ is over. The relative performance (RS) is above its EMA but it needs to overcome the recent highs to indicate that QQQ is now leading the SPY. A move above the major RS resistance at line d is needed to confirm that QQQ is leading the SPY. NYSE Composite The loss of upside momentum was also evident on the more broadly-based NYSE Composite as it closed Tuesday on the day‚Äôs lows as it failed to reach the 20-day EMA at 18,663. There is further chart resistance, line a, in the 18,818 area. The NYSE McClellan Oscillator rallied from the April 8 low to close Tuesday just above zero at +10.59. The downtrend at line b needs to be overcome to signal a further rally. The NYSE All Advance/Decline line has rallied from the recent lows but is still below the declining EMA and resistance at line d. The downtrend in the A/D line (line c) needs to be overcome to turn it positive. The S&P futures are down 41 points at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is an hour before the open. Of course, it is the close that will be more important. If the stock market declines sharply for a few days it will hopefully encourage a return to sanity before there are new ill-informed tariffs on the pharma industry.

U.S. stock futures moved lower Wednesday as investors braced for another wave of geopolitical and earnings headlines. S&P 500 futures were down 0.5%, the Dow hovered near flat, and Nasdaq futures dropped more than 1%. These are the stocks most likely to shape the news. Wednesday‚Äôs most closely watched story centers on Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), which disclosed a $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its H20 AI chips to China. The Biden administration initially crafted the export controls to limit China‚Äôs access to advanced semiconductors ‚Äî but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Nvidia‚Äôs stock is down nearly 7% premarket. Given its rank as the third-largest U.S. company by market value, the fallout could be wide. Chipmaker AMD (AMD+2.02%) also dropped 6% premarket. In Europe, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML+1.37%) reported first-quarter sales of ‚Ç¨7.7 billion ‚Äî just below analyst forecasts ‚Äî and warned of ‚Äúgreater uncertainty‚Äù ahead due to U.S.-China tariff tensions. ASML, which makes the machines used in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, has seen its shares fall 28% over the past year despite the AI boom. Also before the bell, Abbott Labs (ABT+0.90%) ‚Äî best known for developing medical devices and consumer health staples like Pedialyte and Ensure ‚Äî topped earnings expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $1.09 on 4% reported sales growth. Its medical devices segment surged nearly 13% on an organic basis, driven by a 20% jump in diabetes care. Shares were flat to modestly higher ahead of the open. Prologis (PLD+2.62%), the world‚Äôs largest industrial REIT, posted first-quarter core FFO of $1.27 per share, meeting estimates. The company, which operates logistics hubs crucial to global supply chains, highlighted solid rent growth and occupancy, even as leasing cooled. ‚ÄúPolicy uncertainty is making customers more cautious,‚Äù said CEO Hamid Moghadam. ‚ÄúBut over the long term, limited new supply and high construction costs support continued rent growth.‚Äù Kinder Morgan (KMI+1.25%), CSX (CSX+1.23%), and U.S. Bancorp (USB+1.35%) are also set to report Wednesday, offering insight into the state of energy infrastructure, transportation, and regional banking. Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook, while March retail sales data is due, offering a window into consumer behavior before the latest tariff escalation. The CNN (WBD+0.75%) Fear & Greed Index remains stuck in ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù territory, a mood that‚Äôs proven hard to shake since President Trump‚Äôs early April tariff blitz.

U.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%. Nvidia stock plunged 6.9% after the company disclosed a $5.5 billion charge linked to fresh U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips ‚Äî once seen as a workaround for earlier bans. AMD (AMD+2.02%) stock fell 7.4%, while chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7% after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates and warned that escalating tariffs could cloud the global outlook through 2026. Markets retreated further as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs were ‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù to fuel inflation, and suggested the central bank will wait to gauge their effect before lowering interest rates. ‚ÄúTariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,‚Äù Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. ‚ÄúThe inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor the time being,‚Äù Powell said, ‚Äúwe are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.‚Äù Still, there were bright spots. Abbott Labs (ABT+0.90%) beat earnings expectations with adjusted EPS of $1.09 and double-digit organic growth in its medical device division, including a 20% jump in diabetes-related products. Prologis (PLD+2.62%), the world‚Äôs largest industrial REIT, met forecasts with $1.27 in core FFO and reaffirmed guidance ‚Äî but noted rising customer caution. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales surged 1.4% in March, the biggest monthly gain since January 2023. Analysts said shoppers likely pulled purchases forward to avoid tariff-driven price hikes: Think customers loading up on TVs and T-shirts at Costco (COST+2.17%) ahead of potential price pain. The CNN (WBD+0.75%) Fear & Greed Index remains in ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù territory ‚Äî a mood that‚Äôs proven hard to shake since Trump‚Äôs tariff barrage earlier this month. It should come as no surprise: This is a market increasingly driven by policy whiplash, cheerleading soundbites, and dropped hints of trade negotiations. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals ‚Äî often via social media or offhand remarks ‚Äî are proving as influential as official announcements. And it‚Äôs not just the policy that‚Äôs unpredictable. The choreography is, too. The most closely watched story Wednesday centered on Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), the third-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and its disclosure of the $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its AI chips to China. The Biden administration originally designed export controls to curtail China‚Äôs access to advanced AI chips ‚Äî but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Also in chips news, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML+1.37%) reported first-quarter sales of ‚Ç¨7.7 billion, or about $8.7 billion‚Äî below analyst expectations ‚Äî and flagged ‚Äúgreater uncertainty‚Äù ahead due to tariffs. ASML, which makes the machines essential to high-end chip manufacturing, has seen its stock fall by 28% over the last year despite the AI boom. Elsewhere, China posted 5.4% GDP growth for the first quarter, matching the prior quarter. Export activity surged as companies rushed to ship goods ahead of expected new U.S. tariffs. Beijing also named a new top trade negotiator. Still, market watchers seemed to see little clarity ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Nvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. Nvidia on Tuesday said it will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance. Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth. The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have ‚Äúdeteriorated sharply‚Äù owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy. The H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China. ‚ÄúNvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions‚Ä¶now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,‚Äù said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. ‚ÄúSo this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.‚Äù The H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek‚Äôs successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China. Nvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for 13% of sales last year. The chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter‚Äôs earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for ‚Äúinventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.‚Äù Analysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a ‚Äústrategic blow‚Äù for Nvidia‚Äôs efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers. ‚ÄúThis disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it‚Äôs Nvidia,‚Äù they said in a Tuesday research note. The industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China‚Äôs use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. The US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD‚Äôs MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters. ‚ÄúThe Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President‚Äôs directive to safeguard our national and economic security,‚Äù a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying. Nvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing. While the Trump administration‚Äôs imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note. Since DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips. In the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek‚Äôs reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country‚Äôs tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks. DeepSeek, along with many of China‚Äôs established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm. The performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia‚Äôs is expected to widen, Wang said, because of ‚ÄúNvidia‚Äôs superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,‚Äù even as DeepSeek‚Äôs rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware. The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump‚Äôs trade war, according to a new report by the WTO. The WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs ‚Äî especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas. The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs. In North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise. With the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming. ‚ÄúWhile the Nvidia news is concerning, it‚Äôs not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,‚Äù he said. In 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment, high-bandwidth memory chips and products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China‚Äôs technological progress. Related article Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia Before Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month. The series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness. Ned Finkle, Nvidia‚Äôs vice president of government affairs, wrote in a company blog post that the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress ‚Äúin jeopardy‚Äù and threatened to ‚Äúderail innovation and economic growth worldwide,‚Äù he said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Global markets are again under pressure following an escalation in U.S.‚ÄìChina trade tensions, with investors fleeing to havens and tech stocks taking a beating. Gold surged over 2% on Wednesday to top $3,300 per ounce and set a new record high. The dollar weakened further, and Nasdaq futures pointed to a rough day ahead for Wall Street. On Tuesday, the White House announced tariffs of up to 245% on Chinese imports in response to China‚Äôs retaliatory measures and bans on exports of key strategic materials, including rare earth elements, gallium and germanium that are used the production of high-speed computer chips. The move follows an Executive Order launching an investigation into national security risks tied to U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals. Markets reacted swiftly. The Dollar Index (DXY) fell back below 100, signaling reduced investor confidence in the U.S. currency. Meanwhile, the euro strengthened to $1.13 and the yen to 142 per dollar. Equities struggled. Nasdaq futures dropped more than 2%, with tech stocks particularly hard hit. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell 7% pre-market after the company disclosed that new U.S. export controls on AI chips to China would cost it $5.5 billion in lost revenue. The announcement raised concerns of broader earnings hits across the semiconductor industry , which relies heavily on Chinese demand. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped slightly to $83,000 following the news, reflecting its stronger correlation with U.S. tech stocks rather than acting as a safe-haven asset like gold.

Title: Bitcoin Slips With XRP, ADA as Nvidia's Massive $5.5B Charge Sours Investor Sentiment

The mood in the equity and crypto market turned sour late Tuesday as Nvidia shares crashed in after-hours trading following a $5.5 billion charge tied to the Trump administration's decision to ban the company's H20 chip sales to China. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. "All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected," Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of "bad news" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

Title: Tale of 2 playbooks: As mom and pop rush in, the smart money backs off

As markets swing wildly on tariff headlines and economic uncertainty, a curious split is emerging: Retail investors are diving in, while institutional players are stepping back. Even as big banks report blowout trading revenue, the underlying behavior suggests churn ‚Äî not conviction. Retail flows into U.S. stocks have surged this past week, with everyday investors ‚Äúaggressively buying the dip,‚Äù according to Vanda Research, even as volatility spikes and recession warnings linger. Trading app data shows a notable uptick in activity, especially among tech names and single-stock bets. In short: Main Street is leaning in. Hedge funds have slashed their equity exposure by nearly $45 billion over the past 30 days, according to data shared by The Kobeissi Letter, marking a sharp divergence from the retail crowd. While the pullback intensified following Trump‚Äôs April 2 ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù speech, when tariff rhetoric escalated and volatility spiked, the retreat has been underway for months. Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) reported that hedge funds sold the largest volume of stocks in a single week since 2010, according to a client note reviewed by Reuters. That week followed Liberation Day ‚Äî but it capped a broader selloff that began earlier this year. In fact, back in February, Goldman flagged that hedge funds were already unloading global equities at the most aggressive pace since 2013, dumping nearly every sector except real estate as tariff announcements began to roll out. The selling has been broad-based, spanning regions and industries, with IG describing the pace as ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù and highlighting the move as a clear signal of mounting risk aversion. The timing matters: Major U.S. indexes have yet to recover to pre‚ÄìLiberation Day levels, and professional money managers appear more cautious in the face of policy whiplash. Rather than piling into rebounds, many seem to be reallocating or sitting tight ‚Äî reflecting a stark contrast with retail investors still buying dips. Looking further out, stocks remain broadly underwater for the year, with the S&P 500 down around 8%, the Dow off about 5%, and the Nasdaq trailing with a 12% decline. Small-cap stocks have been hit even harder, with the Russell 2000 down more than 15% year-to-date. In contrast, gold has emerged as a standout performer, with the PHLX Gold/Silver Index up nearly 39% amid rising demand for (at least perceived) safe-haven assets. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%), and Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) made over $12 billion in equities trading revenue in the first quarter, capitalizing on surging client activity. But the story isn‚Äôt necessarily one of aggressive bets on battered stocks ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of reaction and repositioning. Busy trading desks signal motion, not conviction. Apple (AAPL+2.21%), Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and other retail/institutional favorites are still under pressure. If ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù enthusiasm was dominant among pros, you‚Äôd likely see stronger rebounds in these names. Similarly, if broad-based bullish conviction were driving flows, we‚Äôd likely see sharper index recoveries. So, while the earnings boom reflects the central role these firms play in helping clients reposition quickly in response to shocks, it does not always signal bullish sentiment. Just now, it may signal the opposite. While institutional players are rotating, rebalancing, or simply waiting things out, retail investors appear to be betting on a comeback‚Äîor perhaps are just conditioned by years of dip-buying muscle memory. Whether that confidence is rewarded or punished will depend on what happens next in Washington and on Wall Street.

Title: How Are the ‚ÄòMagnificent 7‚Äô Companies Faring Amid Trump‚Äôs Tariffs?

To say it‚Äôs been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump‚Äôs volatile tariff announcements.

You can opt out anytime. The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs for the U.S.‚Äôs largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect‚Äîcausing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days‚Äîexcept for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here‚Äôs a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple‚Äôs hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker‚Äôs share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump‚Äôs 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump‚Äôs initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president‚Äôs temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon‚Äôs shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump‚Äôs tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn‚Äôt completely reliant on e-commerce‚Äîits cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company‚Äôs profits and won‚Äôt be as impacted by the administration‚Äôs levies as Amazon‚Äôs physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn‚Äôt spare its stock from a steep drop‚Äîdown more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump‚Äôs 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company‚Äôs core business‚Äîselling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands‚Äîstands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta‚Äôs Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company‚Äôs revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn‚Äôt enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration‚Äôs 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn‚Äôt as lucky with car parts‚Äî30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk‚Äôs controversial role as head of the Trump administration‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Tokens associated with artificial intelligence (AI) fared worse than the biggest cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours. The relative weakness comes amid unusual activity in put options tied to shares of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker that on Monday said it will will start building its AI supercomputers in the U.S. While bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, added 0.6% over 24 hours to $85,500, TAO, the token of blockchain-based machine learning network Bittensor, traded 3.6% lower at $239 and decentralized GPU rendering platform Render Network's RNDR token was 1.7% down at $3.93, according to data source Coingecko. Other tokens, including FET, SEI and GRT lost 2%. Nvidia short-dated put options saw notable activity on Monday, according to data tracked by Convex Value. The action was concentrated in the $100 strike put options expiring on April 17, April 25 and May 2. Additionally, there was activity in the $60 put expiring on April 17 and $50 and $85 strike puts expiring on May 16. Convex Value called the activity in these so-called out-of-the-money put options at strikes below the Santa Clara, California-based company's spot price of $110 unusual. "My bet would be [these are] protective plays," an analyst at the platform told CoinDesk. Buying a put option is akin to buying insurance against market slides. Traders typically snap them up when looking to profit from or hedge their spot/futures bets from a potential market decline.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help ‚Äî I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion ‚Äî $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank ‚Äî is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That‚Äôs a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap ‚Äî a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April ‚Äî and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn‚Äôt talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way ‚Äî it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it‚Äôs going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios ‚Äî such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them ‚Äî where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I‚Äôll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn‚Äôt be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that‚Äôs essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI‚Äôs survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI‚Äôs exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I‚Äôll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it‚Äôs likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won‚Äôt come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion ‚Äî meaning that it‚Äôs on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let‚Äôs pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it‚Äôs likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital ‚Äî whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn‚Äôt committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 ‚Äî a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model ‚Äúchecking‚Äù its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it‚Äôs somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion ‚Äî or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‚Äòsend‚Äô on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it‚Äôs raising. If OpenAI‚Äôs costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we‚Äôd expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren‚Äôt particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that‚Äôs a tenfold increase. But we‚Äôre not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We‚Äôre talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI‚Äôs funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it‚Äôll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia ‚Äî a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that‚Äôs also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there‚Äôs demand for some products ‚Äî like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March ‚Äî it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario ‚Äî OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion ‚Äî it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I‚Äôve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI‚Äôs needs, but not all the time. It‚Äôs not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing ‚Äî the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up ‚Äî meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could ‚Äî and likely is! ‚Äî retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it‚Äôs working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth ‚Äî especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator ‚Äî is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services ‚Äî even in the case of image generation ‚Äî are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company ‚Äî especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate ‚Äî losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it‚Äôs taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn‚Äôt running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn‚Äôt horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do ‚Äî a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation ‚Äî delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI‚Äôs competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it‚Äôll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it‚Äôll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I‚Äôve simplified things here, and that‚Äôs because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn‚Äôt as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It‚Äôs a long, fraught process and one that will be ‚Äî and has been ‚Äî subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI‚Äôs business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative ‚Äî as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase ‚Äî and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health ‚Äî or, in some cases, survival ‚Äî of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn‚Äôt the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn‚Äôt the largest tech company (though, again, it‚Äôs certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers‚Äô collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI‚Äôs failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI‚Äôs involvement in people‚Äôs lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market‚Äôs dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7‚Äôs reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that‚Äôs before the ensuing layoffs. And as I‚Äôve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI‚Äôs success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer ‚Äî OpenAI ‚Äî and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate ‚Äî something that isn't guaranteed ‚Äî it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers ‚Äî Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts ‚Äî the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute ‚Äî are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I‚Äôm basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 ‚Äî the document every company publishes before going public ‚Äî was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer ‚Äî any customer, but really, it means OpenAI ‚Äî fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry‚Äôs first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers ‚Äî CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it‚Äôs taken on a good amount of debt in the past ‚Äî $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 ‚Äî this would be more debt than it‚Äôs ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don‚Äôt fancy Crusoe‚Äôs chances, either. At least Crusoe isn‚Äôt public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue ‚Äî by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 ‚Äî from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don‚Äôt always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion ‚Äî a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 ‚Äî before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it‚Äôs worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI‚Äôs models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there‚Äôs also other companies running their own models on Azure. We‚Äôve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there‚Äôs a giant question mark over OpenAI‚Äôs contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft‚Äôs Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft‚Äôs investment in OpenAI isn‚Äôt entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn‚Äôt paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes ‚Äî as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package ‚Äî under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn‚Äôt a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI‚Äôs ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren‚Äôt the same thing. They don‚Äôt represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide ‚Äî namely, dividends ‚Äî is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn‚Äôt happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it‚Äôs at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren‚Äôt actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I‚Äôm not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent ‚Äî and this is not an opinion, but objective fact ‚Äî on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners ‚Äî Core Scientific and Crusoe ‚Äî that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft‚Äôs relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear ‚Äî I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction ‚Äî framed as a "report" ‚Äî called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future ‚Äî especially in our current political climate ‚Äî is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it‚Äôll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can‚Äôt see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It‚Äôll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I‚Äôll obviously find myself eating crow. But I‚Äôm not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms ‚Äî months-long deferred payments, for example ‚Äî at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it‚Äôll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn‚Äôt a rational argument. It‚Äôs a religious one. It‚Äôs a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies ‚Äî and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI‚Äôs pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft‚Äôs portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft‚Äôs stake, it still ‚Äúowns‚Äù a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we‚Äôre supposed to believe that Microsoft‚Äôs pullback ‚Äî which limits OpenAI‚Äôs access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company ‚Äî is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There‚Äôs probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI‚Äôs next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI ‚Äî and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it‚Äôs leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry ‚Äî including media and analysts ‚Äî that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that‚Äôll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday announced plans to build supercomputers entirely in the U.S., with the chipmaker and its partners set to invest up to $500 billion in American AI infrastructure over the next four years. ‚ÄúThe engines of the world‚Äôs AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,‚Äù Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding "American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.‚Äù Nvidia said its supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, being built in partnership with Foxconn and Wistron, are set to ramp production in the next 12 to 15 months. The chipmaker said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) facilities in Arizona. Nvidia shares were about 1% lower in recent trading, and have fallen about 18% since the start of the year, as concerns about tariffs and other factors have weighed on tech giants.

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) will begin manufacturing AI supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time, the company announced Monday. The chip manufacturer wrote in a blog post that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas. At the Texas factories, located in Houston and Dallas, Nvidia will build and test AI supercomputers. The chipmaker expects mass production to ramp up there over the next 12 to 15 months. The Arizona plant, located in Phoenix, will be reserved for manufacturing Blackwell chips. Production there has already begun. Nvidia said it plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through its various manufacturing partnerships. ‚ÄúNvidia AI supercomputers are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence ‚Äî AI factories that are the infrastructure powering a new AI industry,‚Äù the company wrote. It added that it expects its manufacturing of AI chips and supercomputers to ‚Äúcreate hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security‚Äù over the next few decades. ‚ÄúThe engines of the world‚Äôs AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,‚Äù Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the announcement. ‚ÄúAdding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.‚Äù Nvidia previously has touted its AI supercomputers as being capable of allowing anyone to prototype and develop AI models from their personal computers. The company announced the DGX personal AI supercomputers earlier this year. Nvidia stock fell about half a percent following the announcement about its U.S. manufacturing Monday morning. It‚Äôs down about 20% on the year in the face of the market uncertainty created by President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs.
