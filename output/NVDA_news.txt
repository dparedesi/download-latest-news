US stock markets opened Friday on a turbulent note as investors weighed strong corporate moves against persistent inflation pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record intraday high of 45,203.52, fueled by gains in healthcare stocks. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped to 21,710.67, dragged down by profit-taking in tech and cautious semiconductor forecasts. The spotlight was on UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped over 11% after Warren Buffett’s $1.57 billion stake was disclosed, signaling renewed investor confidence. Traders also digested July’s 0.9% jump in the Producer Price Index (PPI), keeping Treasury yields elevated and adding pressure on growth-oriented stocks.

Title: [Update] NVIDIA’s Rubin AI Architecture Is On Track As Team Green Sticks To Its Annual Cadence, Tackling AMD’s Instinct Series With A Generational Lead

[Update - 8/14/25] - NVIDIA's Rubin architecture and respective GPUs remain on track as part of the company's annual cadence. [Original Post / Debunked] NVIDIA's next-gen Rubin lineup might be delayed by at least a few months, as Team Green is redesigning the lineup to give AMD a tougher competition. The next-gen AI hardware segment is expected to see many changes in terms of the shift in market share from NVIDIA to AMD. Both firms are battling fiercely to bring superior equipment out there; however, NVIDIA seems to see the competition ramping up unexpectedly, which is why the firm is looking for a Rubin redesign. Based on a report by the Fubon Research, which is part of one of the largest banks in Taiwan, it is claimed that Rubin will have limited volume in 2026, marking a delay of approximately four to six months. 1) Rubin redesign leads to more limited volume2) TSMC CoWoS capacity to hit 130k in 20273) Blackwell Volume: 750k in Q1 25, 1.2mn in Q2, 1.5mn in Q3, 1.6mn in Q44) Broadcom is fastest growing CoWoS customer in 2026Source: Fubon$tsm $nvda $avgo pic.twitter.com/ckoZswOCkI While the specifics of a redesign are uncertain for now, NVIDIA's decision is reportedly based on AMD's Instinct MI450 AI lineup. The latter is claimed to debut with IF64 and IF128 configurations, competing with Vera Rubin. More importantly, AMD is claimed to go heavy on HBM capacity, reportedly featuring up to 432 GB per GPU. Hence, NVIDIA might target newer Rubin configurations, but this is just an estimate for now. Moreover, AMD relies on design modularity through the use of Infinity Fabric over Ethernet, which allows for easier rack deployment. It is claimed that the Rubin redesign will limit the shipment volume of the next-gen architecture in 2026, similar to what is happening now with Blackwell Ultra. Eventually, that timeline would be right in time for MI450 to debut in the market, which means Rubin Ultra might get pushed ahead as well. While the reason for Rubin's delay isn't specific, our estimate does indicate that NVIDIA's vigorous product cycle might have caused issues for the firm, and we have discussed this aspect in depth here.

August 13, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: Themes ETF Trust Themes ETF Trust *The Fund has characteristics unlike many other traditional investment products and may not be suitable for all investors. For more information regarding whether an investment in the Fund is right for you, please see the prospectus for more information. **An investor who buys Fund shares after the start of an Outcome Period or who sells shares before the end of an Outcome Period may not fully realize the Accelerated Return and may be exposed to greater losses than that of the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. GREENWICH, Conn., Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leverage Shares by Themes is excited to announce the launch of a new category of single stock leveraged ETFs called the Capped Accelerated series, available for trading starting August 13, 2025. These products are designed to equip investors to amplify up to 200% of the monthly returns of the underlying stock up to a cap, while limiting downside risk to approximately 100% of the underlying stock’s returns. The new ETFs use an options-based strategy to increase return potential for the calendar month period, while limiting the downside to the actual movement of the underlying stock. Simply put: Tailored to target a 200% exposure to the monthly performance of their underlying stocks up to a stated cap and reset on the calendar month, this new series aims to offer sophisticated traders and the retail investors an efficient tool to capitalize on potential amplified returns to upside, without increasing the downside risk if the stock prices move lower. The five new ETFS will be set at a management fee of .75%. The new ETFs are: “The biggest criticism from skeptics regarding Single Stock Leveraged ETFs is that they can potentially be too risky for retail traders who don’t incorporate proper risk management,” said Chief Revenue Officer of Themes ETFs Paul Marino. “We believe this new Capped Accelerated series finally offers investors the potential for amplified returns up, without amplifying losses on the downside.” As part of the Leverage Shares by Themes offering, this new series targets prominent companies at the forefront of AI, digital assets and technological transformation: COIO: This ETF tracks Coinbase (COIN), a leading US-based crypto exchange. As crypto adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves, Coinbase remains a critical on-ramp to the digital asset economy. MSOO: Offering monthly leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy (MSTR), this ETF taps into the dual narrative of enterprise intelligence and Bitcoin accumulation. As one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy offers a hybrid play on business analytics and digital asset appreciation. NVDO: Nvidia (NVDA) sits at the heart of exponential tech growth. With Nvidia powering the infrastructure behind AI, gaming, and data centers, this ETF provides leveraged exposure to a titan behind next-gen computing. PLOO: This ETF targets Palantir (PLTR), a software company pioneering the use of AI and big data analytics in government and commercial sectors. With growing demand for its AI Platform (AIP), Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on data-driven transformation across industries.

Title: NVDA Vs. NVDY: What Your Pick Says About Your Investing Style
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvda-vs-nvdy-which-is-better-nvidia-stock-buy/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:53:52Z

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia is the crown jewel of the AI boom. But how you choose to invest in it, either directly through NVDA stock or indirectly via the NVDY covered call income ETF, reflects your risk appetite, time horizon and definition of returns. This article explores which option (NVDA stock vs. NVDY) is a better fit for your portfolio and what your choice reveals about your investor persona. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) is an actively managed fund that does not invest directly in Nvidia shares, but delivers a far higher income yield vs. NVDA. The fund’s staggering trailing twelve-month (TTM) distribution yield of nearly 80% stems from a unique strategy that generates monthly income through options without actually owning NVDA stock. To achieve this, NVDY implements a “synthetic covered call” strategy by which it To generate monthly income by selling short-term covered calls, NVDY first needs a long exposure to NVDA stock. Rather than buying NVDA shares outright, NVDY creates a cheaper, synthetic long position by This combo allows NVDY to simulate NVDA stock’s price moves, without actually buying the stock. These call and put options typically have durations of one to six months and strike prices near NVDA’s current price at the time these option contracts are executed. The synthetic long position provides NVDY with exposure that is nearly identical to owning NVDA stock. If NVDA rises, the call gains in value and if NVDA falls, the put incurs a loss. If NVDA stays flat, typically both options may expire worthless, and the fund may lose the cost of the call, but this will be offset by the premium received from the short put. Suppose NVDA stock is currently trading at $200/share. NVDY buys a call option with a strike price of $200 (at-the-money) by paying a premium of $15. (Premiums vary depending on volatility and expiration, and the $15 figures here are for illustrative purposes.) This gives NVDY the right to buy NVDA at $200. If NVDA rises to $250, the call option’s value would increase to $50. Subtracting the $15 premium paid, the net profit on the call is $35. As part of the synthetic strategy, NVDY also sells a put option with a $200 strike price, receiving a $15 premium. This gives it the obligation to buy NVDA at $200 if the price falls below that level. If NVDA drops to $150, NVDY is forced to buy at $200, incurring a $50 loss on the put. After subtracting the $15 premium received, the net loss is $35. These call and put options together form a synthetic long position, mimicking the payoff of directly owning the stock. Although synthetic ownership is more complex than buying shares directly, it is significantly more capital-efficient. For example, buying 100 shares of NVDA at $200 each would require $20,000 upfront. A synthetic long position created by buying a call and selling a put at the same $200 strike can replicate this exposure. If the premiums for both options are around $15 each, the net upfront premium may be close to zero. Since each options contract typically represents 100 shares, this setup simulates $20,000 of stock exposure with little or no net premium paid. However, this does not mean the position is free. The short put side of the trade introduces significant downside risk and typically requires substantial margin or collateral. While the strategy uses less capital than directly purchasing the stock, margin requirements and potential losses can be huge. This is an oversimplified example meant to illustrate the concept of capital efficiency. In practice, actual capital requirements and risk exposure will vary depending on market conditions and brokerage policies. Investors don’t need to worry about this nitty-gritty, NVDY fund managers will handle the complexities. NVDY then sells calls against this synthetic long position to generate income from premiums. These call options are typically short-term (expiring within one month or less) and are written at strike prices 0–15% above NVDA’s current price at the time. If NVDA’s price goes up, NVDY makes gains up to the strike price, but anything above that is capped, because the fund sold away that upside in exchange for income. If NVDA stays flat or dips slightly, NVDY retains the premium from selling the call options. This is its main source of monthly income. NVDY also holds short-term U.S. Treasuries that not only serve as collateral for the options in connection with its synthetic covered call strategy, but also earn some interest. NVDY also employs a “Covered Call Spread” strategy—a more nuanced variation of the traditional covered call—used when it anticipates a sharp short-term rise in NVDA’s price or when market conditions make spreads more advantageous than outright calls. In this strategy, NVDY sells a call option while simultaneously buying a call option with a higher strike price but the same expiration date. This approach still generates income and, if NVDA’s price surges, allows NVDY to participate in more upside than a regular covered call would. NVDA stock and NVDY are both Nvidia-focused investments but serve different goals: NVDA stock is regarded as a growth superstar, while NVDY is designed as a tactical income generator. For NVDA investors, gains and losses move in lockstep with the stock price. But, NVDY’s returns, shaped by its synthetic long structure, follow a more complicated path. So, we notice that drawdowns are more or less similar for NVDA and NVDY, but gains are capped for NVDY. So, why invest in NVDY at all? Because of the outsized income yield from NVDY that far surpasses NVDA’s. NVDY pays varying monthly distributions, while NVDA pays a penny in quarterly dividends. On a TTM basis, NVDY has paid distributions totaling $14.04/share, equating to 78.7% distribution yield based on NVDY’s last closing price of $17.85. This far surpasses NVDA’s 0.02% forward yield or annual payout of 4 cents/share on a forward basis. Price performance and Total Returns (including dividends/distributions): Even with NVDY’s hefty monthly distributions, NVDA has delivered stronger total returns. NVDY’s monthly payouts are a mix of return of capital (ROC) and ordinary income (such as option premiums and interest from Treasuries) For example: Why this breakdown matters: Return of capital isn’t taxed when received. Instead, it reduces your cost basis in the ETF, which can increase taxable capital gains when you sell. Illustration: Once your cost basis is reduced to zero, any further ROC distributions are treated entirely as capital gains for tax purposes. The income portion of the payout, however, is taxable in the year received. For July, this would mean the remaining 63% of the distribution was taxable income. Expense Ratio: YieldMax lists NVDY’s gross expense ratio as 0.99%, while many third-party sites like Yahoo Finance report the net expense ratio as 1.27%. That means an investor pays $127 annually for every $10,000 invested in NVDY. Let’s say an investor bought 1,000 shares of NVDY a year ago at around $24/share: Even after accounting for the $304.80 annual fee (1.27% of $24,000), the net income is still exceptionally high. In other words, the expense ratio barely dents NVDY’s income advantage. Since its inception on May 10, 2023, when it was trading around $20, NVDY has paid out $32.71 in distributions. Investors who purchased one share at launch would have recovered their full initial investment and realized an additional $12.71 in income. It is important to note that NVDY shareholders do not receive any dividends paid by Nvidia (NVDA) directly. But with these juicy payouts from NVDY, no investor would have missed much. When it comes to NVDA, the math is simple. You’ll need about 10× the cost of an NVDY share to buy one share of NVDA. Sell NVDA in a taxable account, and you’ll owe capital gains taxes on your profits. Sell it in a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k), and those taxes can be pushed to another day. Lower Entry Cost: NVDY trades at roughly one-tenth the price of NVDA stock, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Capital Efficiency: Through its synthetic long position strategy, NVDY can mimic exposure to thousands of dollars’ worth of NVDA stock with a minimal capital outlay. Attractive Yields - NVDY’s covered call strategy generates eye-catching yields, appealing to income-focused investors. NVDA on the other hand is coveted for its growth potential rather than dividends. Faster Capital Recovery: NVDY’s hefty and frequent payouts can help investors achieve “house money” status quickly, recovering their initial investment through distributions. This can substantially de-risk the investment. NVDA requires selling shares to realize profits. Occasional Upside Participation: when NVDA stock is expected to rally in the short-term (because of a sell-off or some positive development) NVDY employs the “Covered Call Spread” strategy, allowing more upside capture versus a standard covered call if NVDA’s price surges. Asymmetric Downside: NVDY’s synthetic long structure caps upside but leaves investors fully exposed to NVDA’s downside. High monthly income may not be able to offset losses from a sharp NVDA correction. Investor Exodus: Significant price drops in NVDY can trigger investor outflows, lowering Assets Under Management (AUM) and making it harder to generate option income efficiently, thereby creating a negative feedback loop. Distribution volatility: While NVDA offers paltry dividends, NVDY’s monthly payouts can fluctuate sharply — largely because they rely on option premium income and include return of capital. When NVDA’s implied volatility drops or NVDY’s Net Asset Value (NAV) erodes from repeated ROC payouts, the ETF’s distributions could shrink. Opportunity Cost: Historically NVDA’s returns have outpaced NVDY’s significantly. Simply holding NVDA stock may generate greater total returns than NVDY, especially during strong bull runs in tech. If you are betting on Nvidia as a core pillar of an AI-driven future, and seek full participation in Nvidia’s growth story — you’re a Growth Chaser — you pick NVDA stock. If you are comfortable with capped upside and prioritize monthly income, you’re an Income Alchemist — you choose NVDY to tactically monetize volatility and generate consistent yield. If you are looking to blend growth and income — gaining exposure to Nvidia’s long-term upside while securing a steady income stream, you hold both: NVDA for capital appreciation and NVDY for monthly payouts. That makes you the Hedged Optimist. Bottom Line In my view, NVDA stock remains the superior play with its compelling long-term returns despite the meager dividend. The NVDA stock has clearly demonstrated resilience by rebounding and reaching new heights after every sharp correction, highlighting its structural strength. On the other hand, NVDY’s low capital requirements, exceptional yield and the potential to recover capital in a reasonable time frame are alluring. However, the risks of asymmetric downside and NAV erosion — potentially shrinking the very dividends investors seek — make NVDY better suited as a tactical, smaller allocation in a portfolio. By contrast, NVDA stock deserves to be a core holding and investors may consider accumulating on any weakness, although past performance is no guarantee for future results.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Jumps After CEO Meets With Trump
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-intel-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-ceo-meets-with-trump-11789224

Intel (INTC) shares surged again Tuesday following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump on Monday. The meeting came after Trump on Fridy demanded the immediate resignation of Tan, calling him "highly conflicted" over investments in Chinese firms. The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was "very interesting" and that Tan's success is "an amazing story." Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days. Trump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Intel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location. More recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock. Let’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap. A decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July. Buying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March. During future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.

Title: Trump says Nvidia's 15% duty applies to ‘old’ H20 chips, may permit export of up to 50% downgraded Blackwell chip

US President Donald Trump stated that the current duties over Nvidia's export deal with China only cover the older H20 chip, which he described as “essentially old." Speaking to the reporters on Monday (E.T.), Trump said he would consider a deal that would let Nvidia send its Blackwell chips to China if the company could make them less advanced. “It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said.. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit this week to discuss the new chip, Blackwell. Earlier, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) had agreed to give 15% of their Chinese AI chip sales revenues to the US government. This deal is meant to secure export licenses and is considered an unusual arrangement that could unsettle both US companies and Beijing, reported Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut for the US if he approved H20 sales to China, but he ultimately agreed to a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said. Nvidia intends to allocate 15% of its revenue from H20 AI accelerator sales China, the report noted citing a person familiar with the matter, while AMD will pay the same share from MI308 revenues. The revenue-sharing agreement for Nvidia's H20 chip and the possibility of another one for Blackwell chip highlight Trump’s consistent effort to orchestrate a financial gain for America in exchange for trade concessions. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, risk setting a precedent for all American companies operating in the Asian nation and may undermine the US government’s justification for export controls, the report said, citing experts. Over the past week, Trump has criticised chipmakers with various statements that unsettled firms from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless companies invested more in the US. However, these new tariffs would likely affect very few companies, as most major chipmakers are already covered by existing investments or trade agreements.
