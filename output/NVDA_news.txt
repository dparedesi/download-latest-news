ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Incoming Data Points To An Economic Slowdown: Fed Behind The Curve

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Hostilities in the Middle East caused some angst in the equity markets, but not as much as one might have expected. The major indexes were only down between -1% and -2% for the week as shown in the table. Markets await President Donald Trump’s decision regarding U.S. involvement, and that will surely play on market sentiment in the coming days.1 On a year-to-date basis, after huge advances in 2024, the three large-cap equity indexes appear to be treading water, while the small-cap Russell 2000 has given back more than half of its 2024 gain (see table). Markets appear to be more attuned to the softening economy than the Federal Reserve is.2 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. It was also a down week for the Magnificent 7, with only AAPL and TSLA in positive territory. For the year, it is a mixed bag for these seven. Three are positive (NVDA, MSFT, and META) while AAPL, TSLA, and GOOG are down double digits (with AMZN down in the mid-single digit range). It appears that the equity market has become much more selective as often happens in the late stages of a bull run.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. More Soft Data- Retail Sales Much of the incoming data has been soft. Let’s begin with Retail Sales. They fell -0.9% in May. The consensus estimate was for a -0.6% drop, so a miss to the downside. In April, they also fell, but to a much milder extent (-0.1%). It appears that we are still on the downside of the curve and expect more softness going forward.4 Clearly, the U.S. consumer has become cautious. May’s decline was the largest in more than two years (since March ’23), and the April/May results are the first back-to-back declines in more than 18 months. The question is what does this tell us about the future? While the chart below shows a slight hook-up in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, note that most of 2025 has shown quite a significant downtrend. And we don’t expect a sudden change in the consumer’s outlook anytime soon. University of Michigan Retail Sales isn’t the only indicator flashing weakness. Industrial Production, having climbed out of its nearly two-year funk in 2025, declined in May and, given the recent soft survey data (which leads the hard data), appears destined to fall into negative territory soon (see chart below). The utilities sub-component was off -2.9% (was this weather, or a thriftier consumer?), machinery -1.0%, construction supplies (-0.7%) and even the production of consumer goods was off (-0.2%). Bucking the negative trends was production in the Tech space, which was up +0.4% in May (from April) and +10% from year earlier levels. Except for Tech, weakness prevailed.5 The most recent Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index showed up as -4.0 in June (same as May’s -4.0) with its New Orders sub-index falling to +2.3 in June from +7.5 in May. In addition, the workweek turned negative (-1.6 in June from +2.0 in May), an indicator of a slowing manufacturing sector, and, most concerning, the employment sub-index dove to -9.8 in June from +16.5 in May, the largest drop in this sub-index since the Pandemic.6 Federal Reserve Housing, too, showed weakness in May. Unsold inventory, both in the new and existing home spaces, has risen and that is beginning to weigh on home prices. The National Association of Home Builders conducts a monthly survey of its members. The June survey score was 32, falling for four of the last five months. This was the lowest reading since December 2022. Note that the pandemic low was 30 in April ’20. Per Rosenberg Research (Breakfast with Dave June 19, 2025), the current level (32) is the same as it was in 2007 and lower than at any point in the 2001 Recession. In addition, the current sales outlook (35 vs. 37 in May) is the lowest since 2012. U.S. Census Bureau In addition, Housing Starts in May surprised hugely to the downside at an annual rate of 1.256 million units. The consensus estimate was for 1.350 million. This is the lowest level since May 2020 (the depths of the Covid-19 lockdowns) and is -9.8% lower than April’s pace. Starts are now down -4.6% from year earlier levels and look to shrink further over the next few months. Furthermore, building permits (see chart above), clearly a leading indicator, fell -2.0% in May (vs. April) and have fallen in five of the past six months. There is little on the horizon that is going to change this. Also of note is the decline in tourism. David Rosenberg noted in his June 20 daily missive (Breakfast with Dave) that tourism from Europe is off -25% through May versus a year ago, and his description of the loss of tourists from Canada was, in one word, “massive.” This bodes ill for the tourism sector going forward. In past blogs we’ve noted the rapid rise in both auto and credit card delinquencies. Add to this the Trump administration’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s moratorium on student loan payments. The chart below says it all. Delinquencies through the roof. And note that those who are now actually making their student loan payments must forego other uses of those funds, a large portion of which was consumption. This is another negative for economic growth in the near term. FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax At its June meeting, the Fed kept rates at their relatively high levels. It appears to us that the Fed has fallen further behind the curve. Chair Jerome Powell continues to indicate that the Fed is waiting for the “hard” data to soften. Well, retail sales are falling, the housing sector has turned soft, and production continues to decline. While the U3 Unemployment Rate remained at 4.2% in May, it was only because of a shrinkage in the Labor Force Participation Rate (the denominator). In our view, this occurred because jobs are harder to find than they were a couple quarters ago, and people just drop out. The -626,000 job loss that showed up in the Household Survey should have been a wake-up call to the Fed. Clearly, it wasn’t.6 In their June dot-plots, the Federal Open Market Committee sees two rate cuts in 2025, which would leave the Federal Funds Rate somewhere near 3.75%. Neutral, by the Fed’s own definition is 2.5%. With weakness in the survey and now showing up in Retail Sales, Housing, Production and Consumer Sentiment, that 3.75% forecast year-end rate will be uber-restrictive. Since changes in Monetary Policy impact the economy with a significant lag, the incoming data says that the Fed should be easing now. On Friday (June 19), Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a leading candidate for the chairmanship once Powell’s term as chair expires next May, commented on CNBC that he would consider a rate cut at the July meeting. We hope other FOMC members see what he sees.6 Financial markets held up better than expected in the face of Middle-East hostilities. We suspect that won’t be true if the U.S. enters the fight. After the large run-up in 2024, nearly halfway through 2025 shows near breakeven in the major indexes and a -5% loss in the small-caps. Without a new stimulant, and with an economic cooling trend now evident in the data, there appears to be limited upside for the general indexes. “Selectivity” will become the new watchword.2 3 Incoming data continues to show softness, including Retail Sales and Industrial Production. Consumer Sentiment is on a downward trend. These are not good signs for economic growth. Nearly every piece of data coming out of the housing sector is negative. This includes housing starts and building permits. We are just beginning to see home prices stabilize and perhaps pull back a little bit. Tourism to the U.S. from both Europe and Canada has fallen significantly (perhaps there will be bargains this summer for American tourists). Delinquencies continue to rise. Now that the payment moratorium on student loans has ended, add the student loan category to the list. And note that those who are now making their monthly payments have fewer dollars for discretionary purchases. Meanwhile, in the face of a weakening economy, the Fed kept policy tight, and the new dot-plot reveals an FOMC moving a bit toward even more hawkishness. We hope that Governor Waller’s view (open to a rate cut in July) gains traction among FOMC members as the soft economic data dribble in.6 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-mutual-funds-long-term-growth/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T20:51:01Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

Title: What Analysts Think of Micron Stock Ahead of Earnings

Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker's profits to more than double from a year ago. Analysts on average expect Micron to report revenue of $8.86 billion, up 30% year-over-year. It's projected to post adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.61 per share, up from $702 million, or $0.62 per share, a year earlier. In March, the Nvidia (NVDA) partner posted quarterly revenue that topped analysts' expectations, thanks in part to data center sales tripling on growing AI demand. Of the 11 analysts covering Micron tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a “buy” rating for the stock, alongside two “hold” ratings, though their consensus price target near $121 would suggest a decline from Tuesday’s close at $127.91. Shares of Micron have been on a tear in recent weeks, and have added over half of their value in 2025. The results also come after Micron earlier this month announced plans to boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development. The chipmaker said most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," and advanced its high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities. UPDATE—June 24, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.
