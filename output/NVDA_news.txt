Lukewarm second quarter results from AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) Wednesday have Wall Street bros and the analysts that love them catching all kinds of feelings. Long a bellwether for how the market views AI in general, the largest company in the world carries enough weight in its $1 trillion valuation to move entire indexes, let alone the tech sector. That was especially the case over the last two weeks, when handwringing over what Nvidia would say in its second quarter results on Aug. 27 reached a fever pitch. The TLDR take on what all that was and why it matters? Numbers that showed strong growth from Nvidia were good for AI’s continued bull run; weak numbers would mean that the casino-level spending on AI is finally showing signs of a slowdown. With investors like the U.S. government and Meta, Google, and the private market plowing billions into AI and its tools, it’s always wise to pause for a minute and see what the short-term projections may be for such a hot sector. Well, as is usually the case with analyzing Wall Street, that really depends on who you ask. Overall, Nvidia managed to surpass market consensus, with reported Q2 sales of $46.74 billion, up 56% from a year ago, a number that eked past the market’s projected consensus of $46.23 billion. Of that number, roughly $41.1 billion was from the companyâs data centers business, which missed its expected target of $41.29 billion. For some tech sector watchers, that disparity (while considered relatively minor in other businesses) was enough to raise alarm bells that a spending Ice Age could be drawing nigh. â[Data center operator spending] could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,â Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne wrote in a note to investors. To others, however, Nvidia’s results were actually a reassuring sign that AI spending and the investors, banks, and VCs funding it have very little to fear from these particular results. “I don’t care about the seemingly sky-high market capitalization that these stocks have. I’m simply trying to put a valuation on a company that makes what you need to become one of the serious players in AI,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said after parsing earnings. “I learned not to question Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Meta or even Tesla â the big customers â a long time ago. They know more than I do â¦ I’m just grateful they let me along for the ride,” Cramer added. Of course, debate about the bubble wasted no time flourishing across social media Wednesday, with boosters and doubters posting everything from super-long treatises to hot take memes on how close to calamity or calm we are now. just listened to two moms at the playground saying they want to look into starting an âai dentistryâ practice. guys itâs a bubble itâs a bubble pic.twitter.com/oAEbqjddrc — bwabbage (@bwabbage) August 27, 2025 Is it good at NVIDIA missed data center revenue estimates two quarters running?

With data center and growths numbers like the ones posted Wednesday, the outlook surrounding Nvidiaâs earnings has heightened fears that the current surge in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be unsustainable in the long run. You can now expect a growing chorus of analysts to question whether valuations are justified by actual revenue potential, especially amid broader economic uncertainties. Nvidia’s outlook for its business in China was also a key part of its Q2 guidance and highlighted two potentially major hurdles to growth: Disappointing numbers reported from that region, and a continuing uncertainty on what it might expect from American domestic policies. Specifically worrisome is that, despite the Trump administration recently easing restrictions on exports of certain AI chips to Beijing, this policy shift has yet to produce a meaningful recovery in Nvidiaâs revenue from the region. The lingering difficulties in the Chinese market also continue to cast a shadow over the companyâs growth prospects, highlighting how geopolitical tensions remain a significant headwind for the semiconductor giant. artificial intellienceemerging technologiesNvidia Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: 5 biggest takeaways from the Nvidia Q2 earnings call

Time Published: 2025-08-28T02:43:49Z

Nvidia exceeded expectations once again in its second quarter of 2025, but China remains a question mark. On Wednesday, the chipmaking giant reported $46.74 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both beating analyst estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter sales of about $54 billion. Despite the upbeat earnings, Nvidia shares slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of forecasts for a second straight quarter, and as signs of slowing growth began to show. From the uncertainties around the H20 chips' shipment to China to the spending on AI infrastructure, here are the main takeaways from the chipmaking giant's earnings call. Colette Kress, the chief financial officer, said Nvidia has yet to ship any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers recently receiving licenses. On the earnings call, she said that shipments worth $2 billion to $5 billion could flow if restrictions ease, but the company has excluded that revenue from its third-quarter forecast. The company has also floated a 15% remittance to the US government on licensed sales, though no rule has been finalized. "We just have to keep advocating," CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," Huang added. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. Nvidia projected its Q3 revenue at $54 billion with a 2% margin, exceeding analysts' expectations of $53.4 billion. However, the company said its projections didn't include H20 sales to China, which are still uncertain. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told BI that he sees some parallels between Nvidia's current shares and times when Tesla would have strong financials but slowing guidance, which slows the growth in share prices. "Now NVDA is 'only' growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100%+ revenue growth from last year," said Mulberry. "As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock." Nvidia expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, said Kress. The CFO called it a "significant long-term growth opportunity." Her comments come as Big Tech ramps up spending in AI and fuels GDP growth, though some tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned that some investors may be overhyping the sector. Earlier this week, JPMorgan wrote in a note that the high capex spending points to strong growth forecasts in AI. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending," the bank wrote. "This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries." The build-out of AI models has powered Nvidia's growth in the last several years. Now comes robotics. "Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform," Kress said during the call. Robotics remains a small part of Nvidia's business, but Huang and Kress said they're seeing signs of growth. Jetson AGX Thor, Nvidia's latest robotics computing platform or "robot brain," was released earlier this week. Kress said the adoption of Thor "is growing at rapid rate," with more than 2 million developers taking the platform to market. The CFO also said automotive revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $586 million, primarily thanks to self-driving cars. Kress said Nvidia's successor to its popular Blackwell chip architecture, Rubin, is on track for volume production in 2026, giving investors the innovation, predictable product cycle, and revenue generator they like to see. While the earnings call didn't provide many details around the next-generation chip, Kress said the chips are "in fab," meaning that the manufacturing process has begun. "This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software," Kress said. Jump to

(Reuters) - AI chipmaker Nvidia, the dominating force behind the U.S. stock market rally since 2023, forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday. Helped by robust demand for its artificial intelligence chips from cloud providers expanding infrastructure to power generative AI technology, Nvidia expects revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter. That compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.14 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Shares of the world's most valuable firm were down 2.4% in extended trading, paring a knee-jerk loss after the report. NVDA gained more than a third so far in 2025 to outpace the benchmark S&P 500 Index's year-to-date rise of nearly 10%. COMMENTS: THOMAS MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA GEORGIA "The overall AI trade is still very much intact. Nvidia said demand is just really, really high. So to the extent that you believe that, the AI trade is still at the very early stages." "There's nothing really to suggest that the AI trade is over. When you have something that is new, and it's growing as fast as it is, and all of the huge capex announcements from the hyperscalers, it's evidence that we're in the early stages. there's no reason that I can see that you want to sell this off to any great degree." WILL RHIND, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRANITESHARES "The market has gotten so used to NVIDIA delivering blowout earnings and data center growth that anything short of that feels like a disappointment. The modest miss on data center revenue is more a reminder that those huge growth rates are going to slow eventually." BRIAN MULBERRY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "It is double beat on top and bottom line including the $8 billion China cost. After hours even with this strong outperformance the stock is down more than 3% - a signal that the rate of growth is slowing and that causes price momentum to slow in the shares. "We saw this with Tesla at times when they would have strong financials but guidance was slowing as capacity was meeting demand which ultimately slows the rate of growth. Now NVDA is “only” growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100% revenue growth from last year. As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock. "Manufacturing operations seem to be growing at a pace that forward guidance should be easily intact going forward. It looks like they stated the China impact (opportunity costs) of $8 billion which is right on target with Jensen’s previous public statements and in line with Wall Street expectations." DAVID WAGNER, HEAD OF EQUITY, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS "The negative stock reaction feels like a bit of an incorrect knee-jerk reaction - the company is still growing over 50% on their guidance at a $50B quarterly revenue run rate - that's remarkable, even for the current valuation. I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue. I want to be buying the pullback as I am sure management will weave a bullish demand story on the conference call." NICK FRASSE, PRODUCT MANAGER, VANECK ASSOCIATES, NEW YORK “My takeaway is that these numbers are not unexpected, nor is this reaction. The market has begun to factor in that Nvidia can continue to beat most expectations in spite of headwinds and questions like what they will have to pay to continue selling to China. Their earnings beats and growth in EPS have become more normalized as investors understand their business model better. In the early stages of all this excitement, they had crazy beats that seemed to come out of nowhere; no one then had expected a gaming company to have this amazing AI pivot. Now we look at their business model and see that they don’t have the capital spending drag that vertically integrated companies do, but they’re benefiting from all the money that the hyperscalers clearly continue to keep spending on AI. "We launched the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF exactly a year ago today, and Nvidia is its largest holding at 20.67% of the fund right now. These results give us confidence that the hyperscalers are not slowing down, and that it’s getting to the point now where as the Magnificent 7 companies continue to grow, it’s all compounding in their favor. This technology is allowing them to drive revenue higher – and then to spend more of that revenue on more technology.” MATT ORTON, HEAD OF ADVISORY SOLUTIONS, RAYMOND JAMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TAMPA BAY AREA "I think it should be a positive read-through eventually, after the dust settles, to the rest of the AI trade, and the fact that there's still a tremendous amount of growth that's happening." "For Nvidia, it's more of just calibration of expectations, but the fact that you saw such strong growth, particularly across the data centers, and just the absolute numbers that are associated with the revenues that are coming in, I think all of that is a sign that there is still a lot of room to run with respect to the AI capex story." "The mega caps are the ones propelling a lot of the capex that Nvidia is benefiting from. But obviously Nvidia still is growing, is able to sell. If anything, this just highlights that there's a lot of durability to this (AI) trade, and that, I think that the businesses of these hyperscalers can continue to accelerate, and you're not seeing any sort of signs of a slowdown being reflected in the results of Nvidia." "The results from Nvidia will just reaffirm the fact that we're not in an AI bubble." DIMITRI ZABELIN, SENIOR ANALYST, AI, PITCHBOOK, SAN FRANCISCO, CA "Since the onset of the AI boom in late 2022, the company has largely beaten forecasts, propelled by explosive growth in its data center division. "As U.S. hyperscaler demand continues to expand, Nvidia is diversifying by turning to sovereign buyers to anchor the next wave of adoption, positioning national governments as strategic clients for its hardware. "PitchBook’s comp sheet analysis also shows hyperscalers and AI infrastructure leaders outperforming benchmarks, underscoring durable demand for compute hardware as governments and enterprises step up procurement." LARRY TENTARELLI, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, BLUE CHIP DAILY TREND REPORT "In the very short-term, the stock is seeing some downside testing, as they did not drastically exceed the consensus forecasts. Beyond the short-term volatility, Nvidia remains the benchmark Artificial Intelligence stock and the most direct way to invest in the theme. "The AI trade has been the major driver of this bull market over the past 30 months and we expect that both AI and Nvidia will continue to lead. "CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on the conference call will be closely monitored by markets, but barring any slowdown comments from Huang, we would be buyers of Nvidia on any near-term weakness. In our view, this is the dominant AI market leader to own." CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA The results "were okay. They weren't blow-the-doors-off, but nor were they bad. And I think the stock price movement is going to depend a lot on what they say on the earnings call, especially if they give color on China." "I think people were a little disappointed in the data center number, which looks like the sequential growth was about 5% ... and I think people might have been looking for a little bit more on that side." "I'm not surprised that the stock in the after-market is down a bit, but it is not down a ton, especially given the strength that the stock is showing so far this year."

Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly earnings just slightly ahead of Wall Street analysts' expectations, as its sales rose to a record high. The AI chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue that soared 56% year-over-year to a record $46.74 billion in the second quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. (Investopedia's live coverage of the results is here.) Nvidia said its profits benefited from the release of $180 million tied to sales of inventory of its H20 chips, which were banned in China during the quarter by the Trump administration's export controls, to a customer outside China. The chipmaker said that without its sales of previously reserved H20 chips outside of China, it would have reported EPS of $1.04. Data center sales, which make up the bulk of Nvidia's revenue, climbed to a record $41.1 billion, though that figure slightly missed Street projections. Several of Nvidia’s Big Tech customers have committed to big spending plans to build out their AI capacity in recent earnings calls, fueling analysts' lofty expectations, which climbed ahead of Wednesday's report. The chipmaker said its board also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Nvidia shares declined about 3% in after-hours trading. The stock added more than a third of its value in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. Looking ahead, Nvidia projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, which would be another record high. Wall Street analysts had called for revenue of $53.8 billion. However, that forecast doesn't take into account potential H20 sales to China, which could resume, thanks to a recent 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration. Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while it waits for the U.S. government to codify its revenue-sharing agreement. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company’s earnings call that he estimates China's market could represent a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. The CEO also said he sees a "real possibility" Nvidia could be granted a license to sell its Blackwell chips (which are more powerful than H20) in China, as the company continues talks with the Trump administration about expanding its access to the region.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Wednesday as investors anticipated the release of a quarterly update from semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) after the closing bell. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%, sending the benchmark index to another all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also up 0.2%, while the blue-chip Dow closed Wednesday's session 0.3% higher. Recap Investopedia's coverage of today's trading here. Nvidia shares, which are up about 35% this year so far to lead the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks, were about flat in the regular session. Detailed coverage of its earnings is available here. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, jumped 7.5% to secure the S&P 500's top daily performance. The move higher came a day after UBS upgraded Albemarle to "neutral" from "sell" and lifted its price target on the stock. Analysts cited an improving outlook for lithium prices in 2026 following recent production cutbacks in China. Albemarle and other lithium producers have been cutting costs and scaling back expansion plans as they navigate a prolonged slump in the price of the key battery component. An upgrade from UBS also helped shares of casino operators. Analysts at the firm raised their view on Wynn Macau, a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) operating in the Asian gaming hotspot, to "buy" from "neutral." UBS highlighted improved growth forecasts for Macau's gross gaming revenue and suggested that high-end operators like Wynn are likely to sustain or increase their market share in the special administrative region. Wynn Resorts shares gained 3.5%, while shares of fellow Macau-exposed gaming companies MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) were also up more than 3%. Database software firm MongoDB (MDB) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter and increased its full-year outlook, and its shares skyrocketed roughly 38%. Strong customer additions and subscription revenue growth underpinned the company's performance. The report helped boost the shares of other database software firms, including those of service analytics specialist Datadog (DDOG), which advanced 4.3%. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares dropped 6.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock has seen significant volatility since the completion of the merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global earlier this month. The latest move lower came after Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on Paramount Skydance stock, citing a steep valuation and muted growth expectations for adjusted operating income. BofA Securities analysts downgraded SBA Communications (SBAC) to "neutral" from "buy" and cut their price target on shares of the wireless infrastructure real estate investment trust. The downgrade came after DISH TV operator EchoStar (SATS) said that it sold 50 megahertz of its nationwide low- and mid-band spectrum allocations to AT&T (T). Analysts believe the move suggests that AT&T could scale back its network densification efforts, which would have a negative impact on SBAC's business. SBAC shares lost 4.9% on Wednesday. Shares of J.M. Smucker (SJM) sank 4.4% after the food and beverage manufacturer reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter. The company said tariff-related pressure on its U.S. retail coffee division—home to the Folgers, Dunkin', and Café Bustelo brands—weighed on its performance. An executive said Smucker is planning addition price hikes for its coffee products later this year. A 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on certain imports from Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, took effect earlier this month.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Nvidia is set to release its second-quarter earnings results after the market closes on Wednesday, with analysts widely bullish on the chipmaker’s stock despite some trade policy headwinds. Why it matters: The upcoming earnings report will provide additional insights into Nvidia’s pivotal role in AI technology and the impact of recent challenges, such as China export restrictions. The details: Options traders are predicting a roughly 6% movement for Nvidia’s shares in either direction following the results, which is below the 7% long-term average move. What they’re saying: The big picture: Nvidia’s earnings report is highly anticipated by investors who are keen to see how the company has performed recently, particularly in its business operations in China, and to gain insights into the broader trends within the artificial intelligence sector.

Nvidia (NVDA) reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday, posting revenue of $46.7 billion, a 56% increase from a year earlier. The results underscore the chipmaker’s role at the center of the AI boom, as demand for its high-powered processors showed little sign of slowing. Shares of the company fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, with some noting data center revenue as a bit soft at $41.1 billion against estimates of $41.29 billion. AI-linked tokens such as Internet Computer ICP$4.9193, NEAR Protocol, and Bittensor TAO$320.47 showed little reaction to the news, trading roughly flat from prior to the results. Bitcoin BTC$110,003.54, ether (ETH) and XRP XRP$2.8782 knee-jerked lower on the news, but quickly retraced those losses, showing roughly no net movement from prior to the earnings. Wall Street will parse Nvidia’s commentary closely, especially for signs that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon are still ramping up chip orders. Analysts are also looking for updates on the company’s work to develop more advanced chips for China, a market where U.S. export restrictions complicate sales. Nvidia is set to host its earnings call at 5 p.m. E.T., where executives will field questions from analysts.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Beats Wall Street Expectations And Sets Another Quarterly Sales Record

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The world’s most valuable company reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat Wall Street’s expectations yet again, with investors seeking clues into how Nvidia fared with challenges in the China market. Nvidia reported $46.7 billion in second-quarter revenue, surpassing the chip designer’s sales record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter and besting economist forecasts of $46.05 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. A bulk of Nvidia’s top-line came from nearly $41.1 billion in data center revenue, which Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote Monday would drive Nvidia’s business over the next year, behind predictions of $41.3 billion. The AI firm brought in adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 and $25.78 billion net income, besting Wall Street’s projections of $1.01 EPS and $24.7 billion, respectively. Nvidia’s top- and bottom-line figures account for annual increases of 6% and 42%, respectively trumping the year-earlier totals of $30 billion and $0.67 EPS. Nvidia shares briefly fell 4% in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s earnings report. The stock hit an intraday high of $184.12 earlier this month, while Nvidia shares traded around $181 before market close Wednesday. Nvidia will host a call with investors at 5 p.m. EDT. Some analysts are looking for answers from CEO Jensen Huang about the Chinese government pressuring domestic companies not to buy the company’s H20 AI processors over national security concerns, leading Nvidia reportedly to halt production. Morgan Stanley believes this “remains an important issue to resolve long term,” though it would likely be resolved “with both countries incentivized to enable access to U.S. hardware,” Moore wrote. Kevin Cassidy, an analyst for Rosenblatt Securities, wrote his firm believes Nvidia will introduce a “China-specific” alternative to the AI chip, which could “command a higher price point, better margins and offer a more competitive solution.” WedBush Securities, in a note Wednesday led by Seth Basham, said Nvidia is one of 30 companies that will “define the future of the AI revolution over the coming years.” The brokerage dispelled fears Nvidia and other AI firms would be the victims of a broader “stock market bubble,” adding, “The potential for AI to drive productivity and economic growth dwarfs past technologies.” As the last of the “Magnificent Seven” companies to report Q2 earnings this year, Nvidia closes out a three-month period of growing competition, specifically in China. Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon reported a record $402 million profit over the first half of 2025, though Wall Street remains optimistic for Nvidia’s growth prospects while backed by demand for AI technology and data centers. Analysts for Evercore ISI wrote earlier this month they believed rising cloud demand at companies like Amazon indicates AI has “hit a tipping point at enterprises,” as Nvidia’s chips are the “solution of choice” for training AI language models. The brokerage noted Nvidia remains its “top pick” in the near term and lifted its price target for Nvidia’s stock to $214 from $190.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.04. “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.” During the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $14.7 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 26, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to the Company’s share repurchase authorization, without expiration. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on October 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on September 11, 2025. Q2 Fiscal 2026 Summary Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its first quarter earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Title: When does Nvidia report earnings? Time, how to tune in

Time Published: 2025-08-27T20:03:06Z

Nvidia (NVDA) reported better than expected results in its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Aug. 27, roughly two weeks after the company agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of the sale of its H20 chips to China. The company reported $46.7 billion dollars in total revenue, a 56% rise year-over-year, with a corresponding rise in data center revenue. Still, analysts were expecting $41.3 billion in data center revenue and the company reported $41.1. Nvidia’s stock traded down to roughly $179 per share early on Wednesday, Aug. 27 but by around 4 p.m. ET, its stock rose to about $182, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares slipped in the after hours, trading around $176 or down around 3% as of 6:30 p.m. ET. The company previously said it expected to lose $8 billion in the second quarter after President Donald Trump banned the sale of its chips to China in April. Trump later rescinded the ban. Nvidia said in its earnings release that it sold none of it's chips made for the Chinese customers in the country but it "benefitted" from the release of $180 million in inventory to a customer outside of China. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings call that the company could ship $2 billion to $5 billion in revenue from the H20 chip in the thrid quarter if "political issues" are resolved. Analysts anticipated a 6.2% move for the stock, which could bring the to an all-time high of $192.88, or send it down to $170.66, mimicking its July levels. The company reported an EPS of $1.05, beating expectations of $1.01, and revenue of $46.7 billion, beating expectations of $46.1 billion. Additionally, the company announced a $60 billion share buyback program and issued guidance of $54 billion for the next quarter. The chipmaker’s earnings and sales were expected to jump 53% from a year ago to $45.9 billion, CNBC reported. Out of the last 12 financial reports, Nvidia has topped estimates 11 times. The stock is currently up 30% year-to-date. In July, Nvidia became the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap. Analyst Jacob Bourne of Emarketer pointed to the shortnening runway for AI and increased competetition for Nvidia stock slipping in commentarty provided to USA TODAY. "The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify," Bourne wrote. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said that the stock had been "priced at perfection" in provided commentary. "Even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation," Monteiro wrote.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration AI hype that has helped push U.S. stocks to fresh records this year has driven an explosion in leveraged single stock exchange-traded funds, a universe of speculative products that is likely to be tested by Nvidia's Wednesday earnings. Companies that investors expect to benefit either directly or indirectly from the AI revolution now dominate U.S. single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs, underscoring investor demand for products that magnify their AI-themed bets, according to a Reuters analysis of industry data from issuers, Morningstar and CFRA Research. So far in 2025, asset managers have launched 112 U.S.-listed leveraged and inverse ETFs tied to a single stock, compared with 38 in all of 2024, according to data from Morningstar, CFRA Research and issuers, leading some analysts to warn the market is getting overcrowded. Leveraged and inverse ETFs, which allow investors to profit when shares rise or fall, use swaps or options to produce those targeted returns and are attractive to speculators eager to play daily price moves.

Options traders are pricing in about a $260 billion swing in Nvidia's market value following its results, Reuters reported on Monday."There are more and more opportunities every day for investors to gamble on individual stocks that are part of this dominant AI theme, and any earnings announcement is going to be key," Armour said.That effect was highlighted on Tuesday, when shares in AI-driven database company MongoDB skyrocketed more than 23 per cent in after-hours trading, after it reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings and announced big gains in AI-related clients. That triggered a 46 per cent gain in the Tradr 2x Long MDB Daily ETF launched by Tradr ETFs only two weeks earlier. Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs, said the company is looking for new ways to explore the AI theme, pointing to a 2x ETF tied to Constellation Energy it launched in July.

For issuers, the products are attractive because they generally command fees averaging 0.96 per cent compared to 0.54 per cent for the ETF industry as a whole.

Title: Brace For NVIDIA Stock To Move By 2.6x Intel’s Market Cap

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The single most important earnings announcement of the just-concluded quarter is now at hand, with NVIDIA preparing to divulge its quarterly financial performance this afternoon. And, the options market is pricing in swoon-worthy moves as a result. Depending on how you calculate it, the options market is currently expecting NVIDIA stock to move between $10.5 (based on the extrinsic values of at-the-money options) and $13.05 (based on the bid prices of at-the-money call and put options) by Friday. Since each $4 move in NVIDIA shares is roughly equal to Intel's entire market capitalization of around $100 billion, the options market is currently expecting NVIDIA stock to move between 2.6x and 3.26x Intel's market cap by this Friday! Of course, as is usually the norm, the largest percentage move in NVIDIA stock is expected to materialize in the after-hours trading session today. JP Morgan) NVIDIA (NVDA) Earnings PreviewIndustry Commentary – We (Harlan and team) believe near-term AI fundamentals remain solid, supported by strong hyperscaler CAPEX spending. This trend was clearly demonstrated during the 2Q25 earnings season, where cloud/hyperscaler… pic.twitter.com/oe6cg2vgJj As far as NVIDIA earnings specifics are concerned, Wall Street is expecting the GPU giant to post a solid beat on consensus estimates, thanks to the production ramp-up of GB200 chips and the concurrent inauguration of GB300's production process. As such, analysts expect NVIDIA to exceed its own revenue guidance of $45 billion for the just-concluded quarter, with the guidance for the October quarter likely to materialize within the $53 billion to $54 billion range, as per JPMorgan's estimates. Interestingly, NVIDIA's revenue figure of $44 billion for its April-ending quarter included around $4.5 billion worth of H20 GPU sales. Given the current reigning uncertainty around the future of that chip in China, JPMorgan believes an appropriate quarter-on-quarter baseline revenue figure for NVIDIA should preclude H20 sales, resulting in a sequential upside of between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion if NVIDIA manages to exceed its own revenue guidance for the July-ending quarter. Of course, the H20 GPU represents the biggest source of uncertainty this time around. NVIDIA's existing H20 inventory is worth around $1.9 billion and can yield ancillary revenue of between $5 billion and $6 billion if the entirety of its inventory is depleted via the sales channel. JPMorgan calculates that every 100,000 units of NVIDIA H20 GPU that is sold in China yields $1 billion in revenue. Accordingly, NVIDIA can collect between $3 billion and $4 billion in additional revenue per quarter over 2 to 3 quarters. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The largest company in the world by market cap at $4.4 trilion, Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings after the U.S. market close on Wednesday. Data from Bitcoindata21 on X shows that Nvidia earnings have historically correlated with a positive Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last 10 earnings reports since early 2023, when the current bull market began, bitcoin has posted positive price action following Nvidia results in 7 out of 10 instances. For the quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 on revenue of $46.2 billion. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the options market is pricing in a 6.1% post-earnings implied move in Nvidia. That translates to a potential swing of roughly $270 billion in market capitalization. It sounds large, but this would be the smallest implied swing since May 2023. Shares of Nvidia are up 30% year to date and 41% over the past year. It's modestly lower in early Wednesday trading ahead of the quarterly results.

Title: Serve Robotics’ Target Of Deploying 2,000 Level 4 Autonomous Urban Delivery Robots By Year End Is Now Attracting Wall Street’s Attention

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The age of robots is neigh, and the market is currently sifting through the available players to sniff out those with an intrinsic advantage. Enter Serve Robotics, whose partnership with NVIDIA and Uber demands a prominent place in the last-mile urban delivery space. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Serve Robotics is currently pioneering 4-wheeled robots that leverage AI to navigate dense cityscape. These third-gen robots support advanced sensing tech and copious onboard computing resources, thanks to NVIDIA's Jetson Orin module. Of course, NVIDIA had precipitated a significant rally in Serve Robotics' stock in 2024 when it took a 10 percent stake in the company. Interestingly, NVIDIA divested the entirety of its stake in Q4 2024. Do note that Serve Robotics is currently partnered with Uber Eats to offer autonomous food deliveries in US cities such as Los Angeles. In the second quarter of 2025, the company deployed 120 delivery robots, bringing its total fleet strength to 400. Critically, Serve Robotics intends to expand its robot fleet size by 400 percent to 2,000 units by the end of 2025. Wedbush starts Serve Robotics $SERV at Outperform with a $15 PT — about 46% upside from here. Calls out strength in its autonomous delivery platform tied to AI growth. Shares sold off after $NVDA trimmed its stake, but Uber still holds ~8% and remains a key partner. It is this aggressive growth spurt that is now attracting Wall Street's attention. For instance, Wedbush has just initiated its coverage on the stock with a $15 stock price target, implying a 35 percent upside from the current price levels. Similarly, earlier in August, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on Serve Robotics shares, replete with a $17 stock price target. Serve Robotics announced $642,000 in revenue in Q2 2025, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 46 percent. The company's strong liquidity position of $183 million (as of the end of Q2) has played an important role in aiding its hyper-aggressive expansion efforts. The company is also tapping into multiple revenue streams. For instance, it is selling advertising space on its delivery robots, allowing advertisers to gain visibility as these delivery robots become an increasingly common sight on urban walkways. Serve Robotics has a low-cost CapEx model, where it outsources the actual manufacturing of its iconic robots to Magna. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to price its delivery services at a more competitive sub-$8 price point, allowing a break-even period of less than 2 years for each robot.

Title: Nvidia earnings: Wall Street watching for hyperscaler spending, China demand with stock near highs

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Second quarter Revenue estimate: $46.23 billion Third quarter Full year 2026 Source: Bloomberg Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.
