ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Shares of a major automaker surged Friday on a strong earnings report, while a shoes and apparel maker lost ground after warning tariffs and higher prices could discourage shoppers. Major U.S. equities indexes finished the week at record highs after the release of a cooler-than-expected inflation report, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow climbed 1% to finish above 47000 for the first time. All three indexes posted roughly 2% gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Ford Motor (F) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday, soaring over 12% after the automaker posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The strong results overshadowed a cut to Ford's outlook, related to the impacts of a fire at an aluminum supplier. Shares of other big automakers, including General Motors (GM), also rose. Tesla (TSLA), which reported quarterly results late Wednesday, finished more than 3% lower. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 8% to finish at record highs following a report that IBM found it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by AMD. Micron Technology (MU), which supplies memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, also gained following the news, adding 6%. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks finished the day up 1.9%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) shares plunged more than 15% to lead decliners on the benchmark index. The Ugg and Hoka shoe maker gave a weaker-than-expected outlook, saying it anticipates a pullback in consumer spending because of tariffs and higher prices. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 6.2% amid concerns about its production outlook, though its third-quarter results topped analysts' estimates as the price of gold has lately surged.

It seems it took nearly a year for Apple just to move a couple of points higher to get an ATH, thanks to A.I. mania pulling all the money from investors. It’s just crazy how a few CEOs can move the whole market direction based on deception and FOMO. Many companies that are spending huge amounts of money on A.I. capex aren’t even profitable. Fundamentals have been tossed aside for possible future gains. Yet when someone says iPhone sales MIGHT be flat, investors panic and sell. It’s so weird. Anyway, I’m glad Apple hasn’t thrown away tens of billions on A.I. nonsense. I prefer human intelligence over A.I. intelligence. Maybe someday people will wake up when a quarter of U.S. citizens are unemployed. The last time Apple was this high was on the back of Apple Intelligence hype, then it sank when it became apparent it was vaporware (for now) AI is here to stay just like the Internet. There may be a dot AI bust because of the froth. Every technology takes away one kind of employment and generates the other kind just like the Internet. The AI gene is out of the bottle, you cannot bottle it in whether you like it or not, remember Netscape and Bill Gates memo to his employees about changing the direction of his ‘ship.’ A big company like Apple can not ignore strong megatrends in technology just by saying , ‘human intelligence’ is better than ‘machine intelligence.’ Your email address will not be published.

Title: Why AMD and IBM Shares Just Took Quantum Leaps to Record Highs?

AMD and IBM took quantum leaps on Friday. Shares in the two companies jumped to record highs after Reuters reported that International Business Machines (IBM) has found that it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by Advanced Micro Devices. Reuters said that a research paper to be released by IBM Monday shows that it can run those algorithms in real time on a kind of chip—called a field programmable gate array semiconductor— manufactured by AMD. AMD shares, which have more than doubled since the start of the year, were up nearly 7% in mid-afternoon trading Friday. IBM stock surged more than 7%, taking its year-to-date gain to about 40%, making it the second-biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025. Shares of Micron (MU), which makes memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, rose 5% on Friday. For IBM, this breakthrough is progress toward making quantum computers more commercially viable and reliable. For AMD, it shows how affordable, flexible chips are becoming essential in advanced research—and extends the chip maker’s reach in next-generation computing. Jay Gambetta, director of IBM research, said in an interview that "Implementing it, and showing that the implementation is actually 10 times faster than what is needed, is a big deal," according to Reuters. Quantum computers use qubits to solve problems thousands of times faster than conventional computers, Reuters said. However, qubits are prone to making errors that overwhelm quantum chips, and tech companies have been racing to solve the problem. IBM plans to build a quantum computer named Starling by 2029, and Gambetta told Reuters the algorithm work was completed a year earlier than expected.

Title: Watch These Intel Stock Price Levels After Chipmaker's Earnings Blow Past Expectations
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-intel-stock-price-levels-after-chipmaker-earnings-blow-past-expectations-11836311

Intel (INTC) shares rose Friday morning after the chipmaker swung to a profit that sailed past Wall Street expectations, signaling its closely watched turnaround plan is gaining traction. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March and has refocused the company’s strategic direction, said the third-quarter results show Intel's "steady progress" in its turnaround, adding that demand for AI has created "attractive opportunities" across its portfolio. The stock was up 1.2% at $38.60 in recent trading, after surging above $41 early in the session to its highest level since April 2024. Coming into today's session, the stock had risen 90% so far this year, with the lion’s share of those gains coming in recent months as investors cheered multi-billion dollar investments from Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank (SFTBY), as well as the U.S. government’s 10% stake in the chipmaker. Below we analyze the technicals on Intel’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for after the quarterly report. Intel shares have consolidated in a rectangle formation throughout most of October, setting the stage for a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend. The trend for the stock has remained bullish since it broke out from a multi-month trading range in September, shortly after the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a chart pattern that signals a sustained upward trend. Let’s apply technical analysis to project a potential near-term bullish target on Intel’s chart and also identify important support levels worth watching during future retracements. Investors can project an upside target on Intel’s chart by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis, we calculate the distance of the strong move higher that preceded the rectangle in points and add that amount to the formation's top trendline. For example, we add $10 to $39, which projects a target of $49. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should initially watch the $36 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the rectangle formation and a cluster of prices situated just below the July 2024 swing high. A close below this level could see the shares retreat to around $32. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near the high of last month’s breakaway gap and a sideways trend that formed on the chart between April and July last year. Finally, selling below this level opens the door for a retest of a lower trading floor near $29. Intel shares may find support in this location around the late September low, which also closely aligns with the Aug. 1, 2024 closing price that preceded the stock’s significant gap lower the following day.

Title: This 7.7% Dividend Is The Last Cheap AI Stock

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. If I can give you one piece of advice now, it’s this: Don’t fear this talk of an AI bubble. In fact, we should love it, because it’s set to hand us a shot at big dividends and gains—especially in closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% today and regularly hand us “dividend deals” that simply shouldn’t exist. Our job: Buy, then ride along as CEF investors, who tend to be slowpokes compared to stock buyers, finally come around and bid our funds’ prices up. And we collect those rich dividends—often paid monthly—while we wait. One CEF is giving us just such a nonsensical discount today: a 7.7%-payer called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). This one holds many key AI players, including Meta Platforms (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as some companies that stand to gain as they work AI into their daily operations, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C). With most of these stocks skyrocketing, AIO should be pricey (“artificial intelligence” is right in the name, after all!). But it’s ridiculously cheap, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the AI stocks it owns). And any selloff in AI stocks would make it even cheaper. Which leads us back to the question on everyone’s mind: Are we in an AI-driven bubble? That’s critical to a buy of AIO now, so let’s dive in. We’ll start with an often-overlooked measure of where people’s heads are: a chart of common Google searches, in this case for the term “stock market bubble.” You can see at the right side of this chart that the term has been gaining since hitting a low in September 2024. It’s now at its highest point in almost five years. Why the bubble fears? Well, if you’ve been investing for a long time, your experience likely includes the popping of two major bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and real estate in 2008. A couple generations were traumatized by those events, and as a result, we’re now in a kind of “bubble” of bubble talk. But are we really in an AI bubble? I’d say no. To start, let’s present the bubble case at its most dire: A Harvard academic recently suggested that, without AI investment, America’s GDP growth would’ve been a meager 0.1% in the first half of 2025. There are a lot of problems with this argument. For one, it ignores the fact that a lot of AI investment is imported from abroad (Bloomberg estimates that imports account for about half of all AI investment), and GDP only measures productivity inside a country. Bloomberg estimates that America’s 1.6% growth in the first half of 2025 would probably be more like 1.1% without AI investment. So, to be sure, AI is contributing much, but not most, of the country’s GDP growth, let alone all of it. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is simply fear-mongering. Don’t take the bait—especially when other indicators point to a stable economy: This chart, for example, tells us that over the last year, Americans have been less delinquent on their credit cards than they were a year ago, and the overall percentage is pretty small—now about 3.1%, much lower than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. But let’s keep the focus on AI for a moment longer, because it sets up just how out of step that discount on our 7.7%-paying AI fund, AIO, really is. This chart comes from a recent Yale study showing that the share of workers exposed to AI hasn’t changed since the tech was released. “If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted,” the authors wrote. Yet this chart shows no change at all. In other words, AI isn’t making Americans poorer. It isn’t taking their jobs, and it isn’t a bubble set to burst. That doesn’t mean it won’t turn into any of those things—but it is none of them now. And that sets us up for a tempting trade. If AI starts taking jobs or making Americans feel more uncertain, we should expect a stock pullback that would hit all sectors, including AI names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and, of course, NVIDIA. If AI doesn’t take jobs because the tech doesn’t wind up meeting expectations, AI investment will drop and, again, take down names like Google, Meta and NVIDIA. Of course, everyone is watching these companies’ stocks like hawks, eager to sell at any sign of trouble. And that’s why, if we see a selloff driven by fear that any of the above-mentioned things will happen without data backing that up, they’ll be great buys. That’s where AIO comes back into the picture. It’s a diversified play on AI that rewards investors with that healthy 7.7% dividend, which comes our way monthly. It’s also a fund we know well at my CEF Insider service: We bought it in September 2020—long before AI was on investors’ radar—and rode it to a nice 23% total return (including its 6.4% dividend at the time we bought) in the following three years. And, as I mentioned before, AIO is cheap today. In fact, it’s cheaper than it was during the April “tariff terror, ” if you can believe it. That’s a setup that makes no sense at all! Yet here it is: We saw last spring’s deep discount flip to a premium by June. Now that premium has disappeared again, and AIO is back in bargain-bin territory. That doesn’t mean it’s worth buying now—but it does mean AIO is more sensitive to sentiment than the AI stocks it invests in. If investors sell off AI stocks, they’ll sell off AIO aggressively, opening up an even bigger discount and boosting its yield (since prices move in opposition to yields). That will be the time to pounce. Meantime, we’ll keep watching AIO and waiting for that bigger dividend, and discount, to materialize, thanks to the crowd’s overwrought bubble fears.

Intel could face heightened expectations from investors when it reports third-quarter earnings after the bell, following a torrid rally in recent months on a flurry of high-profile deals. Though the stock was little changed in early trading Thursday, it's up over 80% for 2025, with most of the gains coming since August when the federal government took a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker. A partnership with rival Nvidia (NVDA) followed last month, adding to optimism around the stock and fueling speculation more deals could be on the way. However, the stock's rapid rise has also stoked some worries it may have climbed too far, too fast, with pressure now on Intel (INTC) to defend its support with evidence it's making progress toward a turnaround. That could set the stage for heightened volatility in the stock, with recent options pricing suggesting traders expect it could swing up to 10% in either direction after the results. There are some concerns on Wall Street that the recent enthusiasm for Intel's stock could be premature. Investors will likely be looking for signs in Thursday's report that the chipmaker is making good on its newfound support. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to swing to a slight profit of 2 cents per share, from a loss in the preceding and year-ago quarters. Its revenue is projected to come in at $13.17 billion, which would represent a less than 1% decline from a year earlier. However, most analysts aren't convinced Intel's stock is a "buy" yet, with those surveyed by Visible Alpha largely maintaining neutral ratings while waiting to see more customer commitments to Intel's manufacturing business. Reports last week suggested Intel may have secured a major new AI customer; Microsoft (MSFT) was floated as a likely name. Announcing a new client along with the earnings could help win over analysts.

Title: Trump to Set Price Floors to Prevent Prices from Falling Too Low

Bessent mentioned seven price floor areas in a CNBC interview but did not name them. Price Floors Across a Range of Industries The discussion of price floors is in relation to the US trade war with China, especially rare earth metals. However, it’s not just rare earths. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “We’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again. And we’re going to do it across a range of industries.” CNBC reports Trump administration will set price floors across range of industries to combat China, Bessent says “When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,” Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C. “So we’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again and we’re going to do it across a range of industries,” the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response. The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing’s rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC. The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” he said. What’s Strategic? Please recall Trump labeled movies a national security threat. With Trump, even the absurd is strategic. “We have things that are more powerful than the rare earth export controls that the Chinese want to put on,” said Bessent. Uh… like what? And if so, why back down? U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China The New York Times reports U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China The Trump administration is seeking to counter new economic measures from China by exerting more control over American companies in key strategic sectors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday. The approach marks a new era of industrial policy in the United States, a contrast to how policymakers have traditionally valued free markets and open investment. But as China’s dominance over the production of rare-earth minerals and battery technology grows, President Trump wants to take a page out of Beijing’s economic strategy. By taking more stakes in American companies that specialize in areas deemed critical to national security, the Trump administration aims to exert more control over what they produce. The goal is for the U.S. to become less reliant on China for sensitive technology that it has been using as leverage in trade negotiations. On Friday, Mr. Trump responded by threatening to put an additional 100 percent tariff on products from China on Nov. 1 and cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. After the announcements caused the stock market to plummet, Mr. Trump quickly qualified his statements. He said he might meet Mr. Xi anyway and wrote on social media on Sunday, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” The Treasury secretary pointed to China’s announcement last week of new export controls on rare-earth minerals as a reason the United States must exert more state control over corporations. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration had identified seven industries that it considered of strategic importance where the United States could seek to exert more government control. He pointed specifically to the defense sector, where in some cases the U.S. government is the largest or only customer of certain companies, and said that the administration could insist that companies spend more money on research and less on stock buybacks. “I do think our defense companies are woefully behind in terms of deliveries,” Mr. Bessent said. The United States would use “price floors” and “forward buying” across a “range of industries,” he added, to ensure that China does not dominate other sectors the way it has with the processing and refining of rare earths. The push for greater government control over the private sector is a policy that he has criticized in the past. Last year, Mr. Bessent delivered a speech at the Manhattan Institute deriding the Biden administration’s subsidies of strategic sectors such as semiconductors as “central planning.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent scolded China for deploying similar tactics. “They are a state economy,” Mr. Bessent said. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.” The countries have also clashed over a U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, a policy U.S. officials say is geared at revitalizing American shipbuilding. Non-Chinese shipping lines must also pay the fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. Those went into effect on Tuesday. Agreement With Bessent “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. Q: I totally agree. But what is Trump’s approach?A: Terrorize allies with tariffs and threats, especially Canada and Mexico. I propose the US expand trade with allies. Specifically, the US should work out a deal for Canada to produce rare earths and Mexico to process them. Canada has vast areas of land to mine and Mexico has cheap labor. Instead, Trump has punished allies as much as China. “Our relationship will never again be what it was,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Irony of the Day “They are a state economy,” Bessent said. Note the the direction Trump is taking the US. Here is a list of US government involvement. Trump’s Takeover of US Businesses “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” said Bessent. OK, what constitutes “overreach”? Movies Are Now a National Security Threat On May 4, 2025 I commented Movies Are Now a National Security Threat, 100 Percent Tariffs Announced Hooray for Hollywood! Just when you thought national security threats could not get any stupider, Trump says Hollywood ‘dying’; orders 100% tariff on non-US movies to save Hollywood. Subsidize Home Builders Please note Trump and Pulte Now Want Fannie Mae to Subsidize Home Builders Trump’s economic illiteracy and disrespect of moral hazards have no bounds. US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs On October 12, 2025, I noted US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs “He [Canadian Prime Minister Mak Carney] wants to make cars, we want to make cars, and we’re in competition,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he sat next to Carney. “And the advantage we have is, we have this massive market.” Trump’s Myopic View of Trade Trump views trade as having a winner and a loser. But other than coercion or force, both sides believe they benefit from a deal or there is no deal. The US could be and should be expanding our relationship with Canada and Mexico. Instead, Trump destroyed it. Meanwhile Bessent says “we have to be sufficient with our allies.” How about practicing that instead of punishing them?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has returned an impressive $83 Bil to its investors in the form of cash through dividends and buybacks. The payouts are only likely to pick up, as Nvidia retains the pole position in the AI silicon race, generating over $75 billion in operating cash flows over the last 12 months. Let's examine some statistics and see how this capacity for payouts compares with the market's top capital-return generators. Interestingly, NVDA stock has provided the 25th largest total return to shareholders in history. Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share repurchases are direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to produce sustainable cash flows. There are additional stocks with similar characteristics. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant advantage to a broader diversified approach, as seen with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock you favor or create a portfolio intended to succeed across various market cycles? Our data indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainty into consistent market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation strategy employed by Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager in the Boston area and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P fell by more than 40%. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What stands out here? The aggregate capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely proportional to growth potential regarding reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) display much faster growth, in a more predictable manner, than the others, but they have returned a significantly smaller share of their market value to shareholders. That's the counterpoint to high capital returns. While appealing, it prompts the question: Am I forgoing growth and robust fundamentals? With this in mind, let's analyze some figures for NVDA. (see Buy or Sell NVIDIA Stock for more information) NVIDIA Fundamentals That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment viewpoint entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers. It is tailored to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside potential. NVDA Historical Risk However, Nvidia is not safeguarded against significant declines. It plunged 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and experienced an even steeper drop of 85% in the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation surge, it fell roughly 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic caused declines of 56% and 38%, respectively. Despite solid fundamentals, Nvidia's history indicates it can experience substantial losses during market downturns. But the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks decline even in favorable market conditions – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a category, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a less volatile experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are down slightly this morning as investors assess a slew of corporate earnings reports and monitor developments in U.S.-China trade relations; Tesla (TSLA) shares are falling after the EV maker’s third-quarter profit came up short of Wall Street estimates despite higher-than-expected revenue; IBM (IBM) shares are lower after its quarterly software sales missed analysts' expectations; Intel (INTC) is set to release results after the closing bell, with traders pricing in a big move in the chipmaker's stock following the report; and oil prices are rising after the U.S. slapped sanctions on major Russian oil firms amid pressure to end the Ukraine war. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving lower Thursday as investors pour over a barrage of earnings reports from major companies and keep tabs on developments in U.S.-China trade relations. Major U.S. indexes lost ground yesterday, led by declines in tech stocks, one day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high. Dow futures were down 0.2% in recent trading, as were S&P 500 futures, while futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs lately but stumbled this week, were up 1.5% at near $4,125 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $109,000, up from an overnight low of $106,700. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can have an impact on mortgage rates and other consumer loans, ticked higher to 3.99% after it recently hit six-month lows. Tesla (TSLA) shares are down in premarket trading after the EV maker's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines. Tesla posted earnings per share of 50 cents in the third quarter, below the 54 cents that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had estimated. Revenue in the period rose 12% to $28.1 billion, beating estimates. Tesla’s revenue grew as customers rushed to take advantage of an expiring EV tax credit, though the company’s investments in restructuring and AI drove its costs higher. On the earnings conference call, CEO Elon Musk touted the company’s advancements in AI, self-driving cars and humanoid robotics, highlighting the technologies as the firm’s next stage of growth. Tesla shares, which through yesterday's close had gained 9% so far this year, were down 4% ahead of the bell. IBM (IBM) shares are sharply lower as a slowdown in software sales growth offset revenue and profit numbers that came in ahead of analysts' estimates. IBM said that third-quarter revenue rose 9% to $16.33 billion, while earnings per share were $2.65, well above the $2.44 that analysts had been expecting. However, the 10% increase in software sales to $7.2 billion came in slightly below estimates and raised concerns about the company's growth trajectory at a time when demand is booming for cloud services. Shares of IBM, a Dow component, were down 7% in recent premarket trading. Coming into today's session, the stock had gained 30% so far in 2025. Intel (INTC) is scheduled to release its third-quarter numbers after the closing bell, and traders anticipate volatility in its stock price following the report. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect quarterly revenue for the embattled chipmaker to have declined slightly to around $13.16 billion, while its adjusted earnings are estimated at two cents a share, an improvement over its loss of 48 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Intel shares have risen roughly 85% so far this year as investor sentiment has been boosted by a series of major investments in the company. The Trump administration in August took an approximately 10% stake in the company, and Intel has also received investments from Japan's SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA). Intel shares were down about 1% in recent trading. Oil futures are surging after the Trump administration put sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies amid pressure to end the war in the Ukraine. The Treasury Department said the sanctions on Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil are designed to “degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine.” West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up more than 5% at $61.50 per barrel. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were also up about 5%. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.
