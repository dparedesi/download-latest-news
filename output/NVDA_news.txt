Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker

Intel’s (INTC+9.18%) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.62%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.26%) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO+0.98%) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks

Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, with the major indexes hoping to build on the previous day's surge as investors assessed another round of big bank earnings and a fresh reading on retail sales. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all meandered slightly above the flatline in early trading. Markets are still enjoying some relief from a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. An upbeat sales outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, 2330.TW) boosted optimism for AI hardware demand this year. The main chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) on Thursday booked a 57% rise in net profit to hit a quarterly record. TSMC shares popped over 5% after its earnings report, while Nvidia stock added 1%. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped nearly 0.1%, weighed on by a slide in UnitedHealth (UNH) following the health care provider's disappointing quarterly print. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here.

Quantum computing stocks pushed on with their run in premarket trading Thursday after gaining steam Wednesday. The good news comes as industry leaders highlight quantum computing advancements and potential growth prospects in the sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT, Financial) shares jumped 15.5%, while Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI, Financial) advanced 3.4%, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS, Financial) gaining 9.6% and IonQ Inc. (IONQ, Financial) rising 1.9%. It reflects a growing interest by investors, spurred by the growing corporate commitment to quantum technologies. However, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial) has been the sector's biggest cheerleader. In the case of Mitra Azizirad, COO of Microsoft's strategic missions and technology division: from 2020, talk will be of businesses moving to become the familiar 'quantum-ready' by 2025. This push is backed up by Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial), which announced that it will host a Quantum Day' at its upcoming GTC conference and is committing to integrate quantum computing within classical systems. Despite some industry sceptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who estimates practical quantum computing is still a couple of decades away, companies are proactively creating the work environments that will make it happen. Microsoft has programs for businesses to help tackle this technological evolution, and Nvidia is now recruiting for roles in quantum research. Since Google broke onto the quantum scene with its Willow quantum chip, the quantum sector has also come under the microscope. Companies in this developing quantum era are positioning themselves for long-term growth and are being watched closely by investors and analysts alike. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Wednesday's stock rally sent Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares surging 3.3%, driven higher by a broader tech sector surge after four banks reported stronger earnings than expected. The latest strategic investment by Nvidia shows its bravery towards industrial AI and robotics. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The chip giant has also provided Taiwan's MetAI with capital in its $4 million seed funding round, making Nvidia its first investment in a Taiwanese company. Kenmec Mechanical Engineering, Solomon Technology, SparkLabs Taiwan, Addin Ventures, and Upstream Ventures were other participants in the funding round. MetAI builds AI-powered digital twin platforms for its own advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities, smart warehouses, and automation systems. It converts a CAD file into a stripped-down SimReady 3D environment within minutes to ease the time to market digital twins for industrial applications. As generative physical AI is an area of increasing focus, Nvidia's partnership with MetAI is a holistic approach to the integration of predictive physical AI that can be trained in simulation environments to deploy robots in autonomous systems. Later this year, the company launched its Mega framework within the Omniverse platform to further digital twin products in the company's broader AI ecosystem. CEO and co-founder of MetAI Daniel Yu said that digital twins have slowed physical AI down in the past because they took so long to be developed. MetAI's hope is to ramp this up, creating synthetic data in its AI-powered digital twin environments. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: How Biden Is Solidifying His A.I. Legacy in His Last Week as President

Time Published: 2025-01-15T22:26:21Z
Full Content:
With less than a week left in office, President Joe Biden yesterday (Jan. 14) signed an executive order to streamline A.I. infrastructure across the U.S. Aimed at bolstering the country’s competitive advantage over the technology, the order earmarks federal sites for A.I. data centers built by private companies. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. “Cutting-edge A.I. will have profound implications for national security and enormous potential to improve Americans’ lives if harnessed responsibly, from helping cure disease to keeping communities safe by mitigating the effects of climate change,” said Biden in a statement. “However, we cannot take our lead for granted.” The order directs the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to identify at least three sites where the private sector can build A.I. data centers. Developers tapped for the land will have to pay for the construction and operation of these facilities. In a nod to the massive amounts of energy needed to power A.I. infrastructure, private companies developing on federal land will also be required to bring enough clean energy resources to match these data centers’ electricity needs. The A.I. revolution has spurred a dramatic rise in the energy consumption of such facilities, which accounted for 4 percent of the nation’s total electricity use last year—a figure that could more than double to 9.1 percent by the end of the decade, according to data from the Electric Power Research Institute. Speeding up A.I. data center development is also a key component of Biden’s new order, which urged agencies to prioritize “expeditious” permitting of A.I. infrastructure on federal land. Opportunities to hasten this process could include establishing “categorical exclusions” under the National Environmental Policy Act for infrastructure that doesn’t have significant environmental impacts, according to White House officials. The executive order came a day after the Biden Administration announced a new framework for the exporting of chips used to power A.I. products. In addition to placing further restrictions on exports to countries like China and Russia, the new rule calls for a 50,000-chip cap per country for most of the world. The rule, which cannot be enforced for 120 days, was met with pushback from impacted countries and major industry players alike. “We believe it is also in the U.S. economic and security interest that the E.U. buys advanced A.I. chips from the U.S. without limitations,” said the European Commission’s tech and security head Henna Virkkunen and trade chief Maroš Šefčovič in a joint statement. U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), meanwhile, called the framework “misguided,” describing it as one that “threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide” in a blog post. “We’re trying to strike the right balance between ensuring the frontier of A.I. stays in the [U.S.] and our close allies while also ensuring that the rest of the world can benefit from A.I. and get the hardware that they need to power A.I. applications going forward,” said Jake Sullivan, the White House national security advisor, while defending the A.I. chip framework in a press briefing earlier this week. “We think this is, in a bipartisan spirit, the way to best preserve and protect America’s lead when it comes to artificial intelligence.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Is It Time to Turn Bullish on IONQ Stock after the Quantum Freefall?

Time Published: 2025-01-15T21:41:29Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. IonQ (IONQ) stock has slumped along with other names in the quantum computing sector following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in early January. However, despite the free-falling share price and cheapening valuation, I’m bearish. This stock rose on the expectation that a quantum revolution was potentially just around the corner, but the reality is that investors will need to be very patient. The stock still looks overvalued, and it’s operating in a crowded space, so not every company will make it. As such, I don’t think it’s time to buy IonQ stock. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener IonQ is a pioneering quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to develop quantum computers. Unlike traditional approaches, IonQ’s method employs lasers to manipulate individual atoms as qubits, potentially enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors. It’s all incredibly interesting, and judging by the company’s robust set of announcements towards the end of 2024, this approach has positioned IonQ as a leader in the quantum computing industry — at least among small caps. However, recent comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have sent quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, into a tailspin. During Nvidia’s CES 2025 event, Huang suggested that practical quantum computers might be 15 to 30 years away from realization. It’s a disappointing timeline, but likely the reality check that the stock market needed. Following Huang’s remarks, IonQ’s stock plummeted by around 40%, alongside significant drops in other quantum computing companies. The market reaction highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector and the substantial gap between current capabilities and commercial viability. One of the reasons why I’m bearish is because IonQ operates in an increasingly crowded quantum computing segment, where many companies are likely to struggle to survive in the long term. The quantum computing landscape is teeming with both established tech giants and innovative startups, all vying for dominance in this nascent field. With major players like IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) investing heavily in quantum technology, alongside numerous smaller companies like Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), the competition is fierce. The Gartner hype cycle suggests that while there will be winners in quantum computing, there will also be many losers — currently, we appear to be heading towards Gartner’s trough of disillusionment, which is a period after the peak of inflated expectations. Some firms will inevitably run out of funding as they pursue approaches that prove difficult to scale or simply execute their strategies poorly. This is particularly concerning for a company like IonQ, which, despite its innovative trapped-ion approach, faces significant challenges in commercialization and profitability. Furthermore, before the late 2024 bull run that preceded the free fall, pure-play quantum computing stocks were facing several challenges, including talent and funding. While IonQ’s cash reserves provide a decent runway, the company continues to lose money. However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials. As noted, IonQ is expected to remain unprofitable for a while, which reinforces my bearishness as it’s hard to construct a valuation-based thesis when profitability is so many years away. Despite this, its revenue projections are promising. The company’s revenue is forecast to grow significantly, with estimates showing a consistent upward trend from $41.6 million in 2024 to $314.6 million by 2027. This represents a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 96% over the four-year period. Due to this impressive revenue growth, IonQ’s forward price-to-sales ratios are expected to decrease from 167.9x in 2024 to 22.2x in 2027, indicating that the stock’s valuation may become more attractive over time. However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors. As a result, I’m going to look beyond analysts’ targets on this occasion. Sign in to access your portfolio

Quantum computing stocks continued rallying Wednesday after quantum-related announcements from both Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%) and Microsoft (MSFT+1.41%). Quantum Computing stock was up by more than 55% at the market close on Wednesday. IonQ (IONQ-4.50%) shares closed up by 33.5%, while Rigetti Computing (RGTI-11.39%) and D-Wave Quantum both saw shares up by around 22% at the close. The stocks climbed Tuesday morning after plunging earlier in the week and the previous week off of doubts by both Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META+0.46%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced Tuesday that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Huang will join quantum executives from companies including D-Wave and Rigetti, the chipmaker said, “to discuss where quantum computing is headed.” Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said. Meanwhile, Microsoft released a blog post Tuesday calling 2025 “[t]he year to become Quantum-Ready.” “We are at the advent of the reliable quantum computing era,” said Mitra Azizirad, chief operating officer of strategic missions and technologies at Microsoft. “And we are right on the cusp of seeing quantum computers solve meaningful problems and capture new business value.” The tech giant also announced its Quantum Ready program to prepare business leaders for quantum computing opportunities.

US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates.

Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement.

The outgoing Biden administration is introducing even more measures focused on keeping advanced chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for artificial intelligence and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. “Advanced AI capabilities — facilitated by supercomputing, built on advanced semiconductors — present U.S. national security concerns because they can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of military decision making, planning, and logistics,” the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement. The new rules encourage chip producers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.37%), Samsung, and Intel (INTC+9.18%), to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence to prevent advanced technology from getting to Chinese customers, Bloomberg previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The measures follow the discovery of TSMC-made tech in a cutting-edge artificial intelligence chip developed by sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei in October. According to the BIS, the new rules improve reporting for transactions with new customers who could pose a risk of diverting semiconductor components to China. Earlier this week, the U.S. published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%), to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others. Meanwhile, the Netherlands released new rules aimed at Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML+0.68%). Under the new export controls, ASML must apply for licenses with the Dutch government rather than the U.S. government to export certain measuring and inspection tools. The rules will be effective starting on April 1. China-based Huawei and its chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), depended on ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography machines to make advanced chips. However, the Dutch government restricted sales of this advanced tech to China last year, which has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment. China also cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make advanced chips designed by Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+0.54%).

Rigetti Computing (RGTI, Financial) shares shot 48% higher on Tuesday after B. Riley reaffirmed the 'Buy' rating and raised the price target to $8.50 from $4.00. It comes on the heels of the company's renewed hopes of commercializing the quantum computing sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Those gains illustrate investor confidence in Rigetti's both intermediate and long-term potential, even given recent market volatility driven by comments from Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) CEO Jensen Huang about the 'very useful' prospects for quantum computers. Regarding Rigetti, "the key driver here is that they have overlooked technical things that are really important," said Craig Ellis of B. Riley, an analyst who cited the scalability of quantum systems for high-value workloads that simply aren't accessible by traditional technologies. Ellis noted that Rigetti's equity capital raises in the fourth quarter of 2024 clearly alleviated prior cash sufficiency concerns, allaying a huge hurdle for the company's growth. Rigetti's investment appeal was also strengthened by his highlighting the company's position as a could-be leader in government-related quantum computing adoption. The analyst acknowledged technical scale-up hurdles and long delays to profitability and countered that rising interest in so-called frontier technologies beyond artificial intelligence could drive up Rigetti's growth. We also pointed to key factors to watch in the years ahead, which included the maturing of the quantum ecosystem and more commercial engagement. Rigetti's strong showing comes as broader quantum computing stocks rebound from a period of under pressure over the past few years. This progress could put the company in a strong position to become a key player in the fast-developing quantum world. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Morgan Stanley: “[TSMC’s] Customers Like AMD And Broadcom Are Releasing CoWoS-S Capacity Due To Weaker Demand,” Allowing NVIDIA To “Convert This Capacity To CoWoS-L For GB300A Production”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few days, the proverbial waters have become quite murky due to the lack of visibility over TSMC's supposed travails related to its bespoke wafer-level system integration platform, CoWoS. Now, however, analysts at Morgan Stanley have stepped up to offer some much-needed clarity on this topic and its implications, if any, on NVIDIA's product roll out. As per a recent report by The Information, NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers purportedly continue to face overheating and glitching issues, apparently prompting the chipmaker's mega customers, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, to pare their respective Blackwell orders. The report went on to note that Blackwell's woes stem from the "way [those] chips connect," alluding to a possible flaw within TSMC's bespoke advanced packaging solution, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), which enables the integration of multiple chips into a single package. This report struck a nerve with investors, especially as NVIDIA had declared back in 2024 that it was able to rectify Blackwell's performance-related teething issues by implementing minor changes to the photomask, a specific template that is used to create patterns on chip wafers. However, soon after, DigiTimes calmed perturbed investors by leveraging its internal sources within TSMC to report that, contrary to The Information's report, TSMC has "maintained" its existing Blackwell orders, negating the rumored decrease in orders from NVIDIA's mega customers. Morgan Stanley’s view on TSMC’s CoWoS order fluctuations highlights that some customers, like $AMD and Broadcom, are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand. $NVDA, however, has stepped in and requested $TSM to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.… https://t.co/jneCfh0goi — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 15, 2025 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh note, shedding some much-needed additional light on this topic. According to the Wall Street titan, some TSMC customers, including AMD and Broadcom, "are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand." This aligns with a separate note penned by Nomura, which notes that NVIDIA "could slash CoWoS-S orders from TSMC and UMC by up to 80% in 2025 due to weaker demand for Hopper platform chips." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's Hopper chips utilize TSMC's CoWoS-S tech while the newer Blackwell chips leverage the global chip fabrication giant's CoWoS-L packaging tech. Coming back, Morgan Stanley then goes on to note that, in light of CoWoS-S capacity cancelations, NVIDIA "has stepped in and requested TSMC to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production." Morgan Stanley also declares: "Despite these shifts, TSMC’s overall CoWoS demand remains steady, with a slight potential increase in GB300A production later this year." This means that The Information's report might have been partially correct: there have been order cancelations at TSMC. However, as clarified by Morgan Stanley, the cancelations only affect orders that leverage TSMC’s CoWoS-S packaging technology and that NVIDIA's Blackwell orders likely remain unaffected.

Title: Is Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Right About Quantum Computing?

“Very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away,” Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote presentation at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week. His comment sent shockwaves through the quantum computing industry, with shares of leading companies like Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum and IonQ plummeting between 30 and 50 percent. These companies’ CEOs were quick to defend their industry in a bid to win back investor confidence. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Jensen Huang has a misunderstanding of quantum. He is ‘dead wrong’ about D-Wave,” Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave Quantum, which develops quantum computing systems, told Observer. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. Our (D-Wave) systems are performing scientific computations on important problems that are not solvable by even massively parallel GPU systems.” D-Wave uses quantum annealing, an approach that excels in solving specific computational optimization problems. This method is particularly useful for materials simulation, scheduling and logistics applications. “Commercial quantum computing is already here,” Baratz added. For example, Canada-based Pattison Food Group reduced an 80-hour scheduling task to 15 hours using D-Wave’s technology. Another client, NTT DOCOMO, Japan’s largest telecom provider, slashed the time to optimize network resources from 27 hours to just 40 seconds. Quantum computing CEOs are also talking up their companies’ revenue and profit prospects. D-Wave estimated its 2024 sales jumped 120 percent from the previous year. IonQ, which makes quantum computers, predicts it will turn a profit on more than $1 billion in sales by 2030, CEO Peter Chapman wrote in a blog post on Jan. 10. Quantum computing relies on qubits—units of data that can exist in multiple states at once—and holds the potential to quickly solve calculations that would take even supercomputers a thousand years. Exciting recent developments include Google’s Willow chip, which solved a random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark problem in just five minutes. RCS, one of the most challenging benchmarks for quantum computers, would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years (1 followed by 24 zeros) to solve, Google claims. However, showcasing potential is different than consistently solving problems. “Quantum systems are highly susceptible to environmental noise, which can disrupt quantum computations. Nick Harris, CEO and co-founder of Lightmatter, an Alphabet-backed photonic computing startup, told Observer. “The breakthrough of Google’s Willow chip does not apply to all quantum computing hardware platforms, and the reality today is that scaling up is nowhere near a given.” Other major challenges include scaling qubit systems while preserving their coherence and connectivity, as well as improving qubit fidelity. “Even with error correction, individual qubit operations still carry a non-zero error rate. Reducing these errors further is essential for achieving reliable computations,” Harris explained. The quantum computing industry is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company. However, Huang’s remarks brought that lofty vision back down to earth. Huang predicted it would be 15 to 30 years before quantum computing is commercially viable. Daniela Herrmann, co-founder of Dynex, a quantum-as-a-service company, partially agrees with that assessment. “Huang’s extended timeline reflects the broader understanding of the challenges in achieving fully developed quantum systems, but it doesn’t fully acknowledge the progress being made by existing quantum-inspired applications,” Herrmann told Observer. She noted that Huang’s remarks seem to keep the spotlight on initiatives like Nvidia’s CUDA-Q, which is yet to solve real-world problems at scale. Quantum computing companies, including Phasecraft, Zapata Computing and Algorithmiq, are making notable strides in developing algorithms that can leverage the limited capabilities of existing quantum hardware. Moreover, advancements in quantum computation optimization are also being spearheaded by the University of Chicago and Stanford University, with recent initiatives focusing on optical computing and exploring its applications in quantum technologies. “Advanced language model A.I. tasks that previously required extensive resources are now being completed with 90 percent less computational overhead,” Herrmann said. “Many tangible business cases don’t necessarily require a universal (gate-model) quantum computer to provide advantages,” Anders Indset, chairman of Njordis Group, a VC firm investing in quantum technology companies, told Observer. “Recent sharp dip seems more like a near-term market correction than a final verdict on quantum’s future. ” Indset believes that Huang’s own economic interests in the field could influence his desire to slow down potential competitors. “While Jensen Huang’s caution may reflect the tough realities ahead, history shows that breakthroughs can come faster than expected,” he said. “A.I.’s voracious need for compute resources is pushing the industry to explore new hardware frontiers—quantum included. Once quantum machines achieve a certain threshold, they could supercharge A.I. by making specific training or inference tasks dramatically faster.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI GPU Export Control Rules Likely To Tighten Under Trump Admin, Says Analyst

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Biden Administration's sweeping set of new rules that restrict AI chip sales to countries not aligned with US national security interests are unlikely to be watered down by the incoming Trump Administration, believes a Taiwan-based semiconductor analyst. The export control rules, which came soon after the CES conference in Las Vegas and amidst a fresh set of media reports outlining troubles with Blackwell GPU supplies, drew a sharp backlash from NVIDIA. The company, which commands an effective monopoly over the global AI chip supply chain, called the new export control rules an attempt to "undermine" American technology leadership by placing control of semiconductor exports in bureaucratic hands. The Biden Administration's latest rules divide the countries to which NVIDIA's advanced AI GPUs can be exported into three categories. The first is a list of nations that are either aligned with US national security objectives or are not a threat to the US. These countries can secure the chips without any hindrance. The second category consists of hostile nations such as Russia and Iran, which are completely barred from procuring either US-origin GPUs or AI software. Finally, the third category limits countries such as India from importing large amounts of GPUs without scrutiny. These nations will be able to import 1,700 GPUs without regulatory scrutiny, and they are designed to prevent the targeted countries from building large-scale data centers capable of advanced defense research. The rules also limit key AI software parameters, such as model weights, from being disclosed to nations. NVIDIA's response to them was hard-hitting, as it characterized the rules as threatening to "to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide." NVIDIA admitted that the new rules will not come into effect until 120 days but cautioned that they were already "undercutting U.S. interests." However, despite NVIDIA's praise of the previous Trump presidency in its comments, one analyst believes that the export rules are only set to tighten during the incoming administration. Sharing his thoughts on X, Taipei-based financial analyst Dylan Nystedt outlined several factors that make it unlikely that the issue "might go away under President Trump." He believes that the reality might be different, and "If anything, the rules are likely to become more extreme over time, not less." He starts off by sharing comments made by TSMC's founder, Dr. Morris Chang, in 2023, where he shared his thoughts and remarked that globalization is dead. Dr. Chang had made similar remarks in 2022 and saw a media mogul agree with him. In his 2023 remarks, the former TSMC boss had also supported American policy objectives of slowing down China's progress. Nystedt also believes that supercomputers are helping adversarial nations such as China and Russia to develop advanced military technologies. He outlined, "Supercomputers have already helped Russia and China develop hypersonic missiles, better jet planes and engines, improved nuclear modeling, more." As a consequence, the analyst outlines that the fear among Washington policy circles is that "AI will be able to help adversaries build far better weapons than engineering and design software has already done." He also shared a highly circulated image of a purported Chinese sixth-generation fighter aircraft prototype that appears to rival Northrop Grumman's Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. According to Nystedt, NVIDIA is misguided in its criticism of the US government. He concludes by outlining that "In its [NVIDIA] zeal to drive computing forward for the good of mankind, it forgot evil exists in the world." Nvidia is unlikely to see any change to the new US export rules on ‘AI Diffusion’ unveiled Monday (1/13). It is not an issue that might go away under President Trump. It is a US National Security issue.

The Dow and other indices rebounded on Tuesday following inflation data that came in cooler than anticipated. AI stocks that declined sharply on Monday recovered early Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.72%), Palantir (PLTR+4.25%), Micron Technology (MU+2.76%), and others all rising. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, increased by only 0.2% in December. This figure was lower than the projected rise of 0.4%. Additionally, the Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained unchanged. With that, all eyes are on Wednesday’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which measures retail inflation and will help determine whether or not the Fed will lower interest rates this year. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 218 points, or 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 shed 0.25% and 0.35%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been rising in the past few days, declined slightly to 4.78%. Oil prices also decreased, with West Texas Intermediate falling by 0.7%, trading around $78.25 per barrel. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.40%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.26%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-1.37%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.67%) on Thursday. Bond markets are moving upward, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.78% as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve may delay lowering interest rates until 2026. This situation has also affected other economies. For instance, Japan, which tried to stabilize the economy and the yen last year, saw its 10-year government bond yield surpass 1%, reaching a 13-year high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the UK, 30-year gilt yields are at their highest levels since 1998. India, which is grappling with currency challenges as the rupee declines, saw its 10-year bond yield experience its biggest single-session rise in over a month on Monday, nearing a two-month high of 6.846%.

The S&P 500 is close to erasing all the gains it notched since Donald Trump’s election victory. As of market close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.92% since Nov. 5 — the day Trump clinched a second term in the White House and set off a stock market rally. S&P 500 futures were up 0.27% early Tuesday, pointing to a potential bounce back after sinking 0.77% so far in January. But if the index continues to close lower through Inauguration Day next Monday, it could represent the worst performance for the S&P 500 between Election Day and a presidential inauguration since 2009, when Barack Obama first took office during the Great Recession, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group reported by CNBC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also pared back its post-election gains in recent weeks, and is now only 0.18% higher than Nov. 5. That index is down 0.85% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still up 3.52% since Election Day, although it has also seen some moderation in returns. A slump in tech stocks on Monday, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.72%), following new Biden administration rules governing the sale of AI chips, sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower. In 2025, the Nasdaq has also slumped 1.63%. Dow futures were up 115 points in pre-market trading Tuesday, while Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.33%. In the aftermath of the election, major U.S. indexes hit new records in a Trump-fueled market rally, with the Dow hitting 44,000 for the first time in its 128-year history and the S&P 500 crossing the 6,000 mark. Investors are also bracing for the start of fourth-quarter earnings, which will kick off Wednesday with major banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.40%), Citibank (C+2.27%), and Wells Fargo (WFC+1.47%). The December Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, is also set to be released Wednesday morning. Economic indicators will continue to have an outsized impact on trading as Wall Street prepares for fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
