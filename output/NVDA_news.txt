(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday, so the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Trump's election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of President Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party President Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture, so there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

All eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.27%) GPU Technology Conference this week, where the company is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said he will share more about the upcoming Blackwell Ultra AI chip, Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual conference, known as the GTC, during the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. On the earnings call, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” according to Huang. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.89%) said in a note on Wednesday that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts also anticipate the chipmaker to share more information on its next-generation networking technology, and long-term opportunities in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Read more: What analysts are saying about Nvidia GTC In January, Nvidia announced that it would host its first Quantum Day at the GTC, and have executives from D-Wave and Rigetti (RGTI-1.33%) “discuss where quantum computing is headed.” The company added that it will unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications.” The same month, quantum computing stocks tanked after Huang expressed doubts over the technology’s near-term potential during the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, saying useful quantum computers are likely decades away. Jefferies (JEF+2.50%) analysts said in a Thursday note that they expect Nvidia’s product announcements at the GTC “to be another positive catalyst” for the company “as investors move past supply-chain noise and can once again get excited about the technology roadmap.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Federal Reserve will probably keep interest rates steady at its two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday. But investors will be laser-focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference for any fresh remarks about tariffs and the central bank’s future course. “I don’t think Powell will be committal on anything” and will probably repeat the Fed will remain data dependent, said Jason DeLorenzo, whose Ad Deum Funds tracks options trading. “I expect a rally during the news conference, so long as Powell doesn’t say anything surprising, as hedges get unwound.” That expectation could be upended if the Fed chair takes the opportunity to say something fresh and substantial or if President Donald Trump says something that unnerves investors. Here’s what else investors will be watching. U.S. retail sales may have rebounded in February, according to StreetAccount consensus estimates. Expectations are for a 0.7% rise in the headline tally from January, when they’d fallen 0.9%. Stripping out auto sales, the gain may be 0.5%, compared with a 0.4% decline.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

Time Published: 2025-03-15T14:02:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

Title: An AI stock picker that beat the S&P 500 last year is dumping tech stocks — but holding on to these Magnificent 7 firms

Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that. Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR). But this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way. AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider. "In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month," Tam said. A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date. "Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech," Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now. Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS). The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%). Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock. "We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development," Tam said. As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker. "We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot," Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm. AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick. The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

Bitcoin's strength persists as tech stocks surge and dollar weakens. The US stock market has opened to a sea of green on seemingly minor news. While President Trump’s call to Vladamir Putin to end the war in Ukraine could be seen as a potential ease to global tensions, the market appears to be responding primarily to a lack of trade war advancements. Markets love certainty and direction, with tariff volatility coming out of the US, Europe, and Canada; this Friday, traders seem optimistic that a reprieve is coming. The DXY dropped just 0.08% moments ago, which is correlated with Bitcoin’s decline of almost 1%. However, Bitcoin has held firm over the last day, outperforming the US market. Against a weakening US dollar, down 0.12% over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin’s relative strength is accentuated by a roughly 2% gain. It is significantly surpassing the Nasdaq, which is up 0.61% over the same timeframe. Yet Bitcoin remains range-bound, with prices fluctuating within a channel between $79,000 and $84,000. Tech equities broadly rallied at the market open, led by Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which gained 6.32%, and NVIDIA (NVDA), which went up 3.33%. Yet Bitcoin-linked investment vehicles, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), showed a parallel upward trajectory, reflecting broader investor interest in digital assets. Bitcoin’s positive divergence amid a mixed economic backdrop, characterized by modest dollar weakness and tech equity strength, indicates sustained market demand.

Stocks rebounded — after entering a correction yesterday — as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opted not to block a funding bill last night. That made it likely that the U.S. government won’t shut down this Saturday. Markets dipped briefly after consumer confidence weakened by ore than expected. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.7% as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing about 360 points, or 0.9%. The Magnificent 7 stocks all rose in trading. Palantir (PLTR+1.57%) and Dell (DELL+2.70%) also advanced. The preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading for March fell to 57.9, lower than both the consensus estimate of 64.0 and the final February level of 64.7. Stocks in focus today: CK Hutchison’s (CKHUY+1.34%) ADRs fell 5.7%, following its Hong Kong-listed shares lower. China used state-controlled media to signal its displeasure with the conglomerate’s planned sale of its ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led (BLK+3.34%) consortium, the WSJ reported. Beijing has refrained from official comment on the transaction. Docusign (DOCU-1.92%) shares jumped 14% after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, even as its projections for future results fell short. Analysts pointed to signs of growth, Barron’s reported. Li Auto’s (LI+0.62%) ADRs climbed even after the Chinese maker of electric vehicles said its revenue will probably fall this quarter. Nvidia (NVDA-1.27%) shares jumped 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF-4.48%) said it’s seen no slowdown in demand for servers it assembles for Nvidia and expects AI-related demand to double this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The company, also called Foxconn, expects total revenue to grow this year. Ulta (ULTA+0.09%) stock gained 7.7% after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results — and despite its projection for the current period falling short of analysts’ projections.

Title: Nvidia Stock To $60?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. NVDA Stock Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 60% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock experienced a sell-off, dropping from approximately $148 in mid-January to around $115 now, which represents a nearly 23% decrease. This decline has been fueled by several factors, such as the introduction of more resource-efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek and worries that decelerating investments in generative AI might reduce the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Additionally, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Separately, see Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track? Here’s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, NVDA stock might incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 indicates that NVDA stock lost more than 60% of its value in only a few quarters. Currently, Nvidia stock has decreased from $148 to $115 in roughly two months. This raises the question: could the stock continue its downward trend and reach approximately $60 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception. Slowdown in AI Demand: Over the last two years, companies have significantly invested in training AI models, with Nvidia’s GPUs becoming the preferred option due to their performance and efficiency. The short-term outlook remains robust, as tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are increasing capital expenditures for 2025 to expand their AI cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, demand may eventually taper off. Since AI model training is predominantly a one-time, compute-intensive process, it could eventually decelerate. As models increase in size, incremental performance improvements are anticipated to diminish, and the supply of high-quality training data might become a limiting factor. Consequently, as the demand for training declines, GPU sales could also decrease. Therefore, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture, the U.S. economy might enter a downturn, potentially even a recession, which could further affect GPU sales. Because AI investments continue to be unprofitable for most companies, they may be prime candidates for cost-cutting measures during an economic downturn. This situation could significantly impact Nvidia. The transition to more resource-efficient AI models could also affect Nvidia. China’s DeepSeek model, launched in January, attracted attention for prioritizing software-driven optimization instead of relying on hardware, which could potentially reduce the demand for GPUs. The company reports that it spent only $5.5 million to train its V3 model, which is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions that firms such as OpenAI are said to have spent. Since DeepSeek’s model is open source, major tech companies might adopt similar cost-cutting strategies. If this approach is widely implemented, it could further reduce the demand for AI computing power. For further information, see how DeepSeek impacts Nvidia The U.S. government has imposed export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s latest AI chipset products destined for China, with the exception of the H20 chips, citing national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are using entities registered outside of China to purchase servers equipped with Nvidia’s latest products from companies in various countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is particularly concerning as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, generating approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25 (around 18% of revenue), compared to only $2.3 billion (8% of revenue) in FY’23. Singapore has now initiated an investigation into these potential loopholes. Such developments could potentially affect Nvidia’s overall revenue to some degree. For further details, see how Trump’s tariffs affect Nvidia stock. NVDA stock has experienced a decline that was marginally more severe than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Are you concerned about how a market crash might affect NVDA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and following previous market crashes. • NVDA stock declined by 62.7% from a peak of $30.12 on 3 January 2022 to $11.23 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, it has risen to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $115 • NVDA stock dropped by 37.6% from a high of $7.87 on 19 February 2020 to $4.91 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 11 May 2020 • NVDA stock declined by 85.1% from a high of $0.99 on 17 October 2007 to $0.15 on 20 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 13 May 2016 NVIDIA’s Revenues have soared, increasing at an average rate of 80.1% over the past three years, which is significantly higher than the 6.3% increase in S&P 500 revenues. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s valuation remains attractive given its strong growth, with the stock trading at approximately 26x consensus FY’26 earnings. Yet, there are some potential risks. In recent quarters, net margins have exceeded an impressive 50%, propelled by robust pricing power and high demand for AI chips. Still, these margins could be at risk if demand declines or if competition intensifies. A slowdown in demand could result in reduced pricing, lower sales volumes, and a significant decline in profitability. As an aside, check out the large move in this quantum computing stock in What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Considering the potential for a slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Will you continue holding your NVDA stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $70, $60, or even lower prices?

March 13, 2025 09:04 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) groundbreaking enhancements to NVIDIA RTX™ neural rendering technologies. NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to bring neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview in April, giving developers access to AI Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs to accelerate neural networks from within a game’s graphics pipeline. Neural shading represents a revolution in graphics programming, combining AI with traditional rendering to dramatically boost frame rates, enhance image quality and reduce system resource usage. “Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,” said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. “This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.” In addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit, a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features. Enabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements — such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more — will be available on Tuesday, March 18. NVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available. RTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5The number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles. As ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today’s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5. At the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its “Zorah” technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination. Return to ‘Half-Life 2’ With RTX DemoThe official release of RTX Remix — featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades — lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates. A year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies. Over 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios’ Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Half-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18. The remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics. Over 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out NowDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time. DLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates. In addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.
