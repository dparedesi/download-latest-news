Title: 6 Vanguard Index Funds To Buy Now

Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

Title: Dow tumbles 800 points as Trump confirms tariffs on Mexico and Canada will start Tuesday | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks slid Monday as investors braced for President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico to go into effect by the midnight deadline. The Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%. The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20. “Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.” Trump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return. “They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect. “Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement. Trump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments. “Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. “For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. “I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said. The import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff. “(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement. Before he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment. Related article Trump’s tariff chaos threatens an economy already flashing yellow lights Trump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses. “Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note. US stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday. Draho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.” The stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey. Markets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented. “To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post. Related article Trump’s tariffs chaos is contributing to delivery delays of goods The sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into “extreme fear” after Trump’s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. The stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth. Bitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin. Meanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine. WTI crude, the US oil benchmark, fell about 2% to its lowest price since December after OPEC+ announced it would begin producing more oil in April.

Sunday's Trump bump in crypto has mostly vanished nearly as quickly as it appeared. In mid-afternoon U.S. action, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $86,700, barely above its level prior to President Trump taking to social media Sunday to tout his plans for coming U.S. crypto reserve. Ether is now actually beneath its pre-Trump level and at 0.025, the ETH/BTC ratio has touched a new five-year low. Other tokens touted by Trump as part of the coming crypto reserve — Solana's (SOL), Ripple's (XRP) and Cardano's (ADA) — have given up sizable amounts of their Sunday gains, though remain somewhat higher than prior to the president's posting. “Crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote to their investors. “The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the U.S. administration.” Crypto stocks have given up large chunks are early gains on Monday, with a number of them — Core Scientific (CORZ) and Bitdeer (BTDR) among them — now sporting sizable losses on the session. Medical equipment maker Semler Scientific (SMLR) — perhaps better-known for its bitcoin treasury strategy — is off 7.3% today after a DOJ investigation for possible violations of a federal anti-fraud law related to its marketing of a product known as QuantaFlo, reported Stat News. The broader stock market is also in the red, with the Nasdaq shedding 1.1% and S&P 500 0.8% ahead of Trump's promised tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6.5% on news that Singapore has charged three men in a U.S. export controls breach case. “Concerns over U.S. growth, and impending tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — set to take effect tomorrow — will be in focus, driving equities and rates,” said Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at crypto market maker Wintermute.

Nvidia (NVDA+2.47%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+8.93%), and Dell (DELL-0.74%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC-5.06%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO+1.47%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM+4.57%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-5.06%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+2.47%) and Broadcom (AVGO+1.47%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+3.29%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT+0.40%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.57%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Title: Mr. Market Thinks Amazon Will Rule The World

Munich, Bavaria Germany - December 11 2022: Amazon Deutschland Services GmbH e-commerce german ... [+] headquarters office building with glass green trademark logo. Ultra HD During a recent client meeting, I talked about Amazon (AMZN) and did a deep dive into its valuation. The results were shocking. When you look under the hood of the stock’s valuation, you see that the market’s expectations for future cash flows are shockingly high. Shocking. Let’s get specific Expectations Investing Analysis on AMZN As I do for all of my Reverse DCF Case Studies, I use my firm’s valuation models to quantify the future performance of the company required to justify its current stock price. Specifically, my model shows that to justify ~$239/share Amazon would have to: Let’s put some context around those expectations. Benchmarking Expectations for AMZN First, growing revenue at 10.9% CAGR for 39 years means Amazon’s revenue would be $32.2 trillion in 2063. $32.2. trillion is 26% greater than the United States’ GDP in 2024. $32.2. trillion would also rank Amazon as the third largest GDP in the world in 2063. See Figure 1 for details. Figure 1: Comparing Amazon’s Revenue to the GDP of the Largest Countries in the World Comparing AMZN Revenue To GDP Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. 2024 GDP stats from Global PEO Services *2063 GDP values assume a 4% nominal compounded annual growth rate. It is important to note that the stock price embeds expectations for revenue reaching $32.2 trillion while Amazon – also – increases its ROIC from 14% to 64%. I think there are several reasons why the expectations embedded in Amazon’s current stock price are too high. Competitive Realities Large revenue growth, like what’s embedded in Amazon’s stock price, implies significant market share gains. I note that market share gains are typically won with lower prices, which are not possible with a company that must also increase its ROIC to very high levels. Specifically, a 14% ROIC ranks 135th in the S&P 500 while a 64% ROIC ranks 11th, behind firms like Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA) and Nvidia (NVDA). In other words, Amazon’s stock price is implying a doubly-incredible future where the company enjoys huge revenue growth and ROIC improvement as well. Currently, only one company, Apple, ranks in the top 10 of the S&P 500 for ROIC (7th) and revenue (3rd). Amazon’s trailing 12 months revenue ($620 billion) ranks #2 in the S&P 500, just behind Walmart (WMT) at $674 billion. For reference, Walmart’s ROIC is 11%. So, hypothetically, Amazon would only need to dramatically improve its ROIC rank to join Apple as one of the few companies to rank so highly for ROIC and revenue at the same time. Expectations Investing Applied Too few investors have the tools to unveil the details behind stock valuations. I make it clear and easy. Math is math. It’s not supposed to be hard. Wall Street wants to keep you in the dark by making you think it is too hard to get the truth about valuation. I shed light into the dark corners of the market and make them into opportunities to profit. I think the MOMO, YOLO, SPAC, NFT, meme stock and meme coin trading ploys are bad for investors, bad for our stock market, and bad for our country. I’m here to give you proven-superior investment research that is good for the long-term health of your portfolio and your peace of mind.

AMD's acquisition of Xilinx adds another dimension to its Stargate potential, as FPGAs offer the kind of flexible computing architecture that might be particularly valuable for handling the diverse workloads and communication protocols that interconnected AI systems would require. With a strong balance sheet, improving margins, and a clear technological roadmap focused on high-performance computing, AMD offers investors an alternative pathway to benefit from the computational demands Stargate will create while potentially outperforming the broader market if the company continues to execute its strategic initiatives. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources – precisely the capability essential for organizations seeking to implement Stargate's vision of interconnected AI. As the Stargate framework enables more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments will increase dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for Stargate deployments. The company's AIP offering already demonstrates Palantir's understanding of the need to connect proprietary data with external AI capabilities – a microcosm of what Stargate aims to achieve at a broader scale. This early positioning in the "AI orchestration" market suggests Palantir could emerge as a critical middleware layer in the Stargate ecosystem, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a somewhat higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will make Stargate's promise of interconnected AI a practical reality for enterprises and government agencies. Palantir Technologies saw its stock surge in early February 2025 after strong earnings, only to retreat sharply as concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts weighed on investor sentiment. The stock initially spiked to record highs but has since tumbled 30%, with accelerating selling momentum pushing it toward key support levels. Despite the pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are split—some see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, given Palantir’s role in federal data initiatives. At the same time, technical indicators suggest further downside risk if support near $85, $66, and $44 fails to hold. Investors should watch for a potential recovery toward $100 and $125 if momentum shifts. The Stargate AI Project represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence architecture that could dramatically accelerate AI capabilities by enabling previously isolated systems to work together seamlessly. The five companies profiled – NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, AMD and Palantir – each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to position themselves ahead of this technological evolution. From NVIDIA's dominance in AI hardware to Microsoft's enterprise software integration, Google's fundamental AI research leadership, AMD's competitive computing solutions and Palantir's expertise in complex systems integration, these firms provide complementary exposures to different aspects of the AI value chain that Stargate aims to revolutionize. While valuations remain elevated across the AI sector, these companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Tech giants that have dominated Wall Street for two years are losing their grip, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks shedding about $1.4 trillion in market value since December, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven index—tracking Apple Inc AAPL, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Microsoft Corp MSFT, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL)) GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META and Tesla Inc TSLA—has fallen roughly 10% from its December peak, officially entering correction territory. Don't Miss: Tesla has been the hardest hit, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet. Elon Musk‘s electric vehicle maker initially surged after President Donald Trump‘s November election victory but has since faced declining sales and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Meta stands as the lone bright spot, bucking the downward trend as investors endorse its AI strategy. The Facebook parent recorded a 19-day winning streak in February, adding more than $320 billion in market value. “The stock market has lost its leadership,” Jim Paulsen, an independent market strategist, told the Financial Times. Trending: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum It's a pivot from 2023 and 2024, when the seven companies posted enormous gains and drove the broader market higher. The Magnificent Seven had surged more than 160% between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, according to the FT, but the index has added just 1% so far this year. Investors are rotating into other sectors, with U.S. bank stocks attracting almost $2 billion in the week ended Feb. 3—the second-largest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Bank of America data cited by FT. Healthcare companies, European equities, gold, and smaller tech groups have also benefited from this repositioning. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Meanwhile, money is increasingly flowing toward privately held tech companies, with Anthropic, Coreweave, Databricks, OpenAI, Perplexity, ScaleAI and xAI—now dubbed the “Private Magnificent Seven,” seeing their cumulative valuation rise 40% between July and January, according to FT. Most market watchers view the broadening gains as healthy for what had become an expensive, top-heavy market. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Mislav Matejka caution that faster AI adoption and fewer barriers to entry could spell long-term trouble for the established tech giants. “Historically, it was never the incumbents which benefited from technological disruption, but the outsiders,” Matejka told FT.

Title: Markets wrap rough month driven by ‘Extreme Fear’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks seesawed Friday, but all three major indexes closed the month in the red — a sign of increasing unease in markets. Volatility gripped markets as traders closed out a dismal February that wiped out some gains. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday and for the fourth day in a row, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Stocks initially rose Friday morning, buoyed by cooling inflation data that provided relief for investors. Yet markets moved into the red midday following a very public heated exchange at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that stoked uncertainty around geopolitical stability. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, popped to its highest level this year. In afternoon trading, markets recouped losses, and the major indexes surged higher to close out the day. The Dow ended the day up 601 points, or 1.39%, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.63%. Yet US markets sputtered in February and slid this week. The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1% this week and is down 1.4% this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.5% this week and 4% this month, its worth month since April 2024. “We believe there is valid concern in the markets about the amount of money being spent on Artificial Intelligence datacenters and capex, considering news from China AI startup DeepSeek in late January,” said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a Friday note. Tentarelli said uncertainty about AI spending coupled with concerns about economic growth has led many of the stocks leading the Nasdaq to underperform. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward tech and was driven higher last year by companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Palantir (PLTR). Yet those surging tech stocks have slowed down this month. Tesla shares are down about 26% over the past month. The reasons for the Nasdaq’s decline range from inflation risk to decelerating growth to its stocks having tough outlooks compared to other assets, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, in an email. “Concerns about potential economic growth deceleration may be fostering increased risk aversion, potentially leading investors to shift away from the more volatile Nasdaq index in favor of more stable investment options,” said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. Nvidia posted strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, though its stock’s high valuation raises the question of how much more room there is to run. Still, the broader market remains near its all-time high, reached just last week. And the bumpiness in the market isn’t all that unusual for this time of year. “The stock market’s recent declines are simply garden variety volatility, largely because February is historically a volatile month, and because we saw significant gains throughout January,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. While new inflation data matched expectations, other economic data released Friday revealed cracks in the economy that contributed to weary investor sentiment: Consumer spending pulled back far more than economists expected in January and posted the biggest monthly decline since February 2021. “Investors will continue to focus on the uncertain growth trajectory as real spending unexpectedly fell in January from weaker consumer demand,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank’s estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 were also revised on Friday to project a decline of 1.5%, rather than growth of 2.3%. “This huge drop in the estimate reflects the very weak data that has been coming out on retail sales, net imports, inventories and new home sales,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said he is cautious about the market due to high valuations. At UBS, strategists advised preparing for volatility ahead, though considered the bull market intact. “We think the bull market is intact driven by healthy economic and profit growth, supportive Fed policy and AI spending/adoption,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Friday note. “But we have also cautioned that volatility would likely be higher this year due to policy uncertainty and trade frictions. Therefore, we have been highlighting that short-term hedges may be worth considering,” said Lefkowitz. CNN’s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Stocks were higher on Friday as President Trump’s latest announcement of new tariffs and China’s vow to retaliate heightened trade tensions. At around 12:40 PM in New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average popped by 0.2%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge tracking consumer spending on goods and services, was released in the morning, showing a 2.6% annual inflation rate for January—matching estimates and signaling steady inflation. Here are stocks to watch today: Dell (DELL-0.74%) shares declined on Friday after the tech company posted better-than-expected earnings but reported revenue of $23.9 billion, falling short of the projected $24.55 billion. Investors are also concerned about the profitability of the firm’s server business. Monster Beverage (MNST-0.21%) stock gained on Friday after the drink company’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ expectations, even as earnings per share fell short, Reuters reported. NetApp’s (NTAP-1.64%) shares fell in the afternoon as the company’s revenue missed consensus. AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA+2.47%) recovered in the morning following President Trump’s tariff plans and China’s vows to take retaliatory measures. Earlier this week, the chip giant surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, highlighting sustained demand fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Rocket Lab (RKLB+3.34%) stock plunged on Friday after the commercial space company posted fourth-quarter results that were in line with expectations but issued disappointing guidance and announced product delays. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+8.93%) shares fell, wiping out gains from earlier this week as the escalating tariff war and economic concerns weighed on the AI hardware maker.

Title: Nvidia and Big Tech stocks can't escape the market's growing anxiety

Tech stocks aren’t feeling the love from investors this earnings cycle, with even Nvidia (NVDA+2.47%) set for a weekly decline despite releasing an upbeat forecast and last-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Dell’s (DELL-0.74%) stock fell on Friday after its profit topped forecasts, but investors chose to focus on a revenue miss and the narrow profitability of its server business. Autodesk (ADSK-1.35%) slumped after rising yesterday on an earnings beat and newly disclosed plans to lay off employees. HP Inc. (HPQ-1.78%) and NetApp (NTAP-1.64%) also slid after earnings. Palantir (PLTR+3.21%) and Super Micro (SMCI+8.93%) extended declines. “While fourth-quarter earnings have been generally positive, with more companies than average beating expectations, some of the commentary about 2025 has been more negative,” Michael Rosen, CIO of Angeles Investments, told Quartz. Weaker consumer spending, tariffs, and possible policy changes are creating uncertainty. Nvidia did give a positive outlook, but investors in Big Tech stocks are still getting more cautious amid the general anxiety, Rosen added. They’ve had an incredible run over the past two years — justified by rising profits — but they’re now broadening their focus, as shown by gains in European equities. Mike Treacy, Head of Market Risk at Apex Fintech Solutions, sees a more-technical explanation for the weakness in tech stocks. “We are seeing a massive unwind across multiple risk assets: AI, momentum stocks, crypto, etc.,” he told Quartz. “We are below the 200-day moving average in both SMH and NVDA. Despite robust earnings from NVDA, we could see technical selling across the AI ecosystem until these charts recover.” The days a single earnings report could cause a jump in Nvidia’s stock are probably over because the company has become so big in market value, said Explosive Options’ founder Bob Lang. “There was nothing wrong with the earnings,” Lang said in an interview. “It’s just become a megacap company, like Microsoft (MSFT+0.40%) before that and IBM (IBM+1.61%) even earlier. It’s unlikely to be better than a market performer, not a stock that fund managers can rely on to make a quarter.” It wasn’t all down-arrow on Friday: Nvidia is trading up on the day.

Title: Nvidia's stock slide kicked its market cap out of the $3 trillion club

Despite delivering another record quarter, Nvidia (NVDA+2.47%) fell out of the $3 trillion market cap club after some unimpressed investors were left wanting more. Nvidia’s stock was up by around 1.4% during morning trading on Friday at around $121 per share, leaving the firm with a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap. Still, the chipmaker’s shares fell in early trading on Thursday after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+3.29%), Intel (INTC-5.06%), and other chip rivals also saw declining shares. “What seems to be driving the share reaction is that it’s yet another typical Nvidia report where they beat and raise expectations,” Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. “For them to have this track record of doing that every time, in some way almost works against them as the market is not impressed unless it is a blowout beat and raise.” The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Its full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is $3 Trillion Nvidia (NVDA) A Value Stock?

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia’s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald’s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company’s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, “The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we’re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute." For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia’s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels—etch and deposition tools—needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia’s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam’s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.
