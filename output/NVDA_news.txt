Title: Bitcoin's Bull Case Strengthens as Dollar Index Slides, Nvidia Hits Record High Amid Recession Cues
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/26/bitcoin-s-bull-case-strengthens-as-dollar-index-slides-nvidia-hits-record-high-amid-recession-cues
Time Published: 2025-06-26T06:25:54Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's BTC$107,245.72 price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. "DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin," Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. "We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely," Altrichter said. Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg, interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo is seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia's stock hit a record high on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a "Golden Wave" of artificial intelligence. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose over 4 per cent to a record high of US$154.10. The rise sent Nvidia's stock market value to US$3.76 trillion, overtaking Microsoft, which was last valued at US$3.65 trillion following a 0.2 per cent increase in its stock. Fueling Nvidia's latest rally, Loop Capital lifted its price target for the designer of high-end AI processors to US$250 from US$175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand," Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote in a client note.

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/25/business/nvidia-shares-hit-record-high-as-wall-street-shakes-off-anxiety-about-ai-chip-export-controls/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T18:27:46Z
Full Content:
Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

We noted in a recent post that NVIDIA appears to have vanquished nearly all of its near-term bearish catalysts, prompting some hedge fund managers based in Boston to ask the rhetorical question: what is keeping the stock from breaking out? Now, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has joined this bullish chorus by pegging a street-high price target of $250 on NVIDIA shares, which implies a market capitalization of $6 trillion! Baruah then cites the math that "just works" to justify his unbridled enthusiasm vis-à-vis NVIDIA. According to Loop Capital's supply chain analyst John Donovan, the spending on GPUs could climb to $2 trillion by 2028, which would be equivalent to between 50 and 60 percent of total installed compute capacity. For context, GPUs account for just 15 percent of the global compute capacity today. This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has already disclosed that it earns between $40 billion and $50 billion in revenue from each GW of new AI infrastructure. According to UBS, assuming a conservative order pipeline of 20GW, this scenario would result in $1 trillion in revenue for NVIDIA. Coming back, Baruah believes that the upcoming next phase of NVIDIA's growth will be driven by hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centers, generative AI, and AI-based accelerated computing. Bear in mind that BofA's Vivek Arya is much more circumspect in his outlook for the overall AI market, expecting a global data center TAM of just around $1 trillion by 2030. As such, Loop Capital now expects NVIDIA to ship 6.5 million GPUs in the ongoing calendar year 2025, and 7.5 million in 2026, replete with an ASP of over $40,000. On the flip side, Baruah concedes the possibility that NVIDIA might realize these numbers and still not reach the stratospheric $6 trillion valuation, owing to a compression in its 30x P/E, which has been the norm for NVIDIA for the last 36 months or so. NVIDIA shares are up 3 percent at the time of writing and trading at the $152 price handle. So far this year, however, the stock is up just around 10 percent.

The CEO of the world’s biggest retail trading platform says that everyday investors are doubling down on their bets despite tensions in the Middle East and other geopolitical uncertainty. In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says retail traders appear to be taking the recent uncertainty as an opportunity to continue buying the familiar names they had already accumulated in the past, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and crypto-related equities. “I was a little bit surprised that over the weekend, when all this was happening, the markets didn’t move so much in the overnight. I don’t know if you were surprised by that, but I feel like if this had happened a year or two years ago, we would have had a huge move, but markets were flat to even a little bit up. And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Besides the top ten biggest stocks, Tanev also says there’s been interest in stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), telehealth company Hims and Hers (HIMS), and oil futures. “There’s been a lot of interest in Circle (CRCL), I think that [Hims and Hers (HIMS)] had a big move yesterday – when you have a big move like that around news, you always have retail and institutional jumping in – so I wouldn’t say it’s just the top ten, there’s new things coming all the time, and now we have futures trading, so we did see some heightened activity around crude oil. But the futures traders have always been trading that, so I would say, broad-based equities and crypto, it’s pretty similar to how it was last week. High volumes, but no huge shifts as a result of the conflict.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and other semiconductor companies surged Tuesday, amid broader market gains as investors welcomed news of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. AMD stock was up 5% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Broadcom added 4%. Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) were also among the other chip stocks on the rise, boosting the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) over 3%. Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Hostilities in the Middle East caused some angst in the equity markets, but not as much as one might have expected. The major indexes were only down between -1% and -2% for the week as shown in the table. Markets await President Donald Trump’s decision regarding U.S. involvement, and that will surely play on market sentiment in the coming days.1 On a year-to-date basis, after huge advances in 2024, the three large-cap equity indexes appear to be treading water, while the small-cap Russell 2000 has given back more than half of its 2024 gain (see table). Markets appear to be more attuned to the softening economy than the Federal Reserve is.2 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. It was also a down week for the Magnificent 7, with only AAPL and TSLA in positive territory. For the year, it is a mixed bag for these seven. Three are positive (NVDA, MSFT, and META) while AAPL, TSLA, and GOOG are down double digits (with AMZN down in the mid-single digit range). It appears that the equity market has become much more selective as often happens in the late stages of a bull run.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. More Soft Data- Retail Sales Much of the incoming data has been soft. Let’s begin with Retail Sales. They fell -0.9% in May. The consensus estimate was for a -0.6% drop, so a miss to the downside. In April, they also fell, but to a much milder extent (-0.1%). It appears that we are still on the downside of the curve and expect more softness going forward.4 Clearly, the U.S. consumer has become cautious. May’s decline was the largest in more than two years (since March ’23), and the April/May results are the first back-to-back declines in more than 18 months. The question is what does this tell us about the future? While the chart below shows a slight hook-up in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, note that most of 2025 has shown quite a significant downtrend. And we don’t expect a sudden change in the consumer’s outlook anytime soon. University of Michigan Retail Sales isn’t the only indicator flashing weakness. Industrial Production, having climbed out of its nearly two-year funk in 2025, declined in May and, given the recent soft survey data (which leads the hard data), appears destined to fall into negative territory soon (see chart below). The utilities sub-component was off -2.9% (was this weather, or a thriftier consumer?), machinery -1.0%, construction supplies (-0.7%) and even the production of consumer goods was off (-0.2%). Bucking the negative trends was production in the Tech space, which was up +0.4% in May (from April) and +10% from year earlier levels. Except for Tech, weakness prevailed.5 The most recent Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index showed up as -4.0 in June (same as May’s -4.0) with its New Orders sub-index falling to +2.3 in June from +7.5 in May. In addition, the workweek turned negative (-1.6 in June from +2.0 in May), an indicator of a slowing manufacturing sector, and, most concerning, the employment sub-index dove to -9.8 in June from +16.5 in May, the largest drop in this sub-index since the Pandemic.6 Federal Reserve Housing, too, showed weakness in May. Unsold inventory, both in the new and existing home spaces, has risen and that is beginning to weigh on home prices. The National Association of Home Builders conducts a monthly survey of its members. The June survey score was 32, falling for four of the last five months. This was the lowest reading since December 2022. Note that the pandemic low was 30 in April ’20. Per Rosenberg Research (Breakfast with Dave June 19, 2025), the current level (32) is the same as it was in 2007 and lower than at any point in the 2001 Recession. In addition, the current sales outlook (35 vs. 37 in May) is the lowest since 2012. U.S. Census Bureau In addition, Housing Starts in May surprised hugely to the downside at an annual rate of 1.256 million units. The consensus estimate was for 1.350 million. This is the lowest level since May 2020 (the depths of the Covid-19 lockdowns) and is -9.8% lower than April’s pace. Starts are now down -4.6% from year earlier levels and look to shrink further over the next few months. Furthermore, building permits (see chart above), clearly a leading indicator, fell -2.0% in May (vs. April) and have fallen in five of the past six months. There is little on the horizon that is going to change this. Also of note is the decline in tourism. David Rosenberg noted in his June 20 daily missive (Breakfast with Dave) that tourism from Europe is off -25% through May versus a year ago, and his description of the loss of tourists from Canada was, in one word, “massive.” This bodes ill for the tourism sector going forward. In past blogs we’ve noted the rapid rise in both auto and credit card delinquencies. Add to this the Trump administration’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s moratorium on student loan payments. The chart below says it all. Delinquencies through the roof. And note that those who are now actually making their student loan payments must forego other uses of those funds, a large portion of which was consumption. This is another negative for economic growth in the near term. FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax At its June meeting, the Fed kept rates at their relatively high levels. It appears to us that the Fed has fallen further behind the curve. Chair Jerome Powell continues to indicate that the Fed is waiting for the “hard” data to soften. Well, retail sales are falling, the housing sector has turned soft, and production continues to decline. While the U3 Unemployment Rate remained at 4.2% in May, it was only because of a shrinkage in the Labor Force Participation Rate (the denominator). In our view, this occurred because jobs are harder to find than they were a couple quarters ago, and people just drop out. The -626,000 job loss that showed up in the Household Survey should have been a wake-up call to the Fed. Clearly, it wasn’t.6 In their June dot-plots, the Federal Open Market Committee sees two rate cuts in 2025, which would leave the Federal Funds Rate somewhere near 3.75%. Neutral, by the Fed’s own definition is 2.5%. With weakness in the survey and now showing up in Retail Sales, Housing, Production and Consumer Sentiment, that 3.75% forecast year-end rate will be uber-restrictive. Since changes in Monetary Policy impact the economy with a significant lag, the incoming data says that the Fed should be easing now. On Friday (June 19), Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a leading candidate for the chairmanship once Powell’s term as chair expires next May, commented on CNBC that he would consider a rate cut at the July meeting. We hope other FOMC members see what he sees.6 Financial markets held up better than expected in the face of Middle-East hostilities. We suspect that won’t be true if the U.S. enters the fight. After the large run-up in 2024, nearly halfway through 2025 shows near breakeven in the major indexes and a -5% loss in the small-caps. Without a new stimulant, and with an economic cooling trend now evident in the data, there appears to be limited upside for the general indexes. “Selectivity” will become the new watchword.2 3 Incoming data continues to show softness, including Retail Sales and Industrial Production. Consumer Sentiment is on a downward trend. These are not good signs for economic growth. Nearly every piece of data coming out of the housing sector is negative. This includes housing starts and building permits. We are just beginning to see home prices stabilize and perhaps pull back a little bit. Tourism to the U.S. from both Europe and Canada has fallen significantly (perhaps there will be bargains this summer for American tourists). Delinquencies continue to rise. Now that the payment moratorium on student loans has ended, add the student loan category to the list. And note that those who are now making their monthly payments have fewer dollars for discretionary purchases. Meanwhile, in the face of a weakening economy, the Fed kept policy tight, and the new dot-plot reveals an FOMC moving a bit toward even more hawkishness. We hope that Governor Waller’s view (open to a rate cut in July) gains traction among FOMC members as the soft economic data dribble in.6 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.
