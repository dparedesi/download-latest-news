Title: Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand

Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher. Case in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date, compared to the broader index's 23% rise. Much of the gains stem from enthusiasm over power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — which includes Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles. By 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study. Also, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note. There’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST). Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period. On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating, The analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from "a paradigm shift in power demand" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development. "We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time," wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team. As Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight. But XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped? With the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. “There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth ahead. If XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

Sorry, dividend investors: You probably won’t be rushing to add Netflix (NFLX) to your portfolios. During the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, CFO Spencer Neuman said that the company has "no plans to increase leverage to buy back stock or to issue a dividend." Neuman said Netflix is still prioritizing “profitable growth by reinvesting in our business” and maintaining “ample liquidity.” Wall Street expects Netflix's full-year free cash flow to top $10 billion in 2026, according to Visible Alpha data. Still, Neuman said Netflix isn’t planning to change its capital allocation strategy. The company said Thursday that it repurchased $1.7 billion of its shares during the third quarter, with more than $3 billion of currently authorized buybacks remaining. “In terms of [the] kind of future of free cash flow, well, that future of throwing off tens of billions of free cash flow, that would be a great future and would be a nice challenge to have,” said Neuman on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. “But no change to our capital allocation policy.” Netflix reported third-quarter results on Thursday. The company's stock was recently up more than 10%. Other big tech companies have a history of issuing dividends—including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week; Netflix (NFLX) shares are surging after the streaming giant grew subscribers and beat analysts' estimates; CVS Health (CVS) shares are tumbling after it replaced its CEO; Apple (AAPL) shares are moving higher on strong iPhone 16 sales in China; and Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to climb after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

Title: Nvidia facing a 'generational' opportunity, stock has nearly 40% upside left: BofA

Investing.com -- Bank of America analysts on Thursday reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and lifted the price target from $165 to $190, implying nearly 40% upside from current levels. BofA also hiked its 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 13% and 20%, respectively. The bank believes that Nvidia, which holds an 80-85% market share, is facing "generational opportunity" in a total addressable market (TAM) exceeding $400 billion, a significant jump from the current year's projections. Analysts said their bullish stance on the stock has been bolstered by several recent industry developments – TSMC’s recent blowout report, AMD’s AI event, and strong Blackwell demand, among others – as well as the company's robust competitive positioning. Moreover, they highlight Nvidia's underestimated enterprise partnerships with major firms like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as its software offerings. “NVDA’s engagements span multiple verticals, and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,” they noted. BofA projects that Nvidia’s free cash flow (FCF) at 45-50% margin remains underappreciated, as it is nearly double the average of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech giants. “In $ terms, NVDA could take in $200bn+ of FCF over the next two years, rivaling that of AAPL and providing growth optionality,” analysts said. In its bull case scenario, BofA suggests that Nvidia could outperform expectations if the networking segment mix reaches 17-18%, driven by the ramp-up of its Spectrum switch and potential market share gains in Ethernet. This could conceptually lead to sales exceeding $200 billion in the fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, there is potential for gross margins to improve toward the mid-70% range, factoring in system mix shifts and better yields from the Blackwell product line.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-2.43%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-0.19%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Major U.S. indexes were higher at midday Thursday, as a strong report on demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all advanced. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) reported profit soared on demand for AI chips, sending its U.S.-listed shares to an all-time high. The news helped drive Nvidia shares to a record high as well. Blackstone (BX) shares also surged to a fresh high after the asset manager said its profit jumped as it brought in more investments. Elevance Health (ELV) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the insurer reported a weaker-than-expected profit and lowered its guidance as changes in Medicaid slashed membership rolls. Shares of CSX (CSX) dropped as the freight shipper’s results missed estimates and it cut its outlook as Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted operations. Lucid Group (LCID) shares sank as the struggling luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker announced a $1.67 billion stock sale and warned it would have a larger quarterly loss than expected. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and yen, but lost ground to the pound. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%), Micron Technology (MU-0.81%), and Broadcom (AVGO-0.91%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE+0.97%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER-0.94%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet. The Financial Times on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the process, reports that Uber has met with advisors in recent months after a third party brought up the idea. A focus of those discussions, which the Times says are still at a very early stage, was Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber 2017. — Rocio Fabbro and William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: A billionaire investor sold his Nvidia shares. It was a 'big mistake', he says

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller admits he has made more than a few mistakes in his career. Selling his Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) shares earlier this year was one of them. In an interview with Bloomberg TV Wednesday, Druckenmiller said he sold all of his Nvidia holdings when the stock was priced somewhere between $800 and $950. “It was a big mistake,” Druckenmiller, chief executive of Duquesne Family Office, said. Nvidia carried out a 10-for-1 stock split in June, when its shares were near a then-record of $1,200 apiece. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company were up 3% in pre-market trading as of Thursday morning, set to open at $139.82 each. Despite some volatility, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 180% so far this year — and is on track to reach another record high this week. The chip giant now has a market capitalization of $3.33 trillion, the second-largest in the world behind Apple (AAPL+1.23%). While the investor had hoped to hold onto his shares of the chipmaker “for years,” Druckenmiller thought the valuation was rich after the stock tripled in a year. “I think Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down we’d get involved again,” Druckenmiller said. “But right now, I’m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.” Druckenmiller said that despite the pullback from Nvidia, he remains optimistic about artificial intelligence. He said his investment firm is eyeing other ways to keep his foot in the door in the booming sector. The investor has a net worth of $9.98 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. While Nvidia isn’t set to report its latest quarterly earnings until late November, Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC) strong results Thursday have helped fuel confidence that the AI boom could extend into next year and beyond. Earlier this month, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for its highly-anticipated Blackwell chip is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker rode demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology to record third-quarter profits; Expedia (EXPE) shares are taking off after a report that Uber (UBER) was considering a takeover bid; Netflix (NFLX) is expected to grow its profit and add new subscribers in its third-quarter earnings report after markets close; shares of CSX (CSX) are falling after the railroad operator said it expects to see a drop in fourth-quarter sales on hurricane disruptions and lower coal demand; and United Airlines (UAL) shares are in focus after jumping 12% yesterday. Here's what investors need to know today. Fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

TSMC's revenue also hit a record, jumping 39% to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion). Both surpassed consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. U.S-listed shares of TSMC are surging 9% in premarket trading and shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are all up at least 3%. Shares of online travel company Expedia (EXPE) are jumping 6% in premarket trading after a report that Uber Technologies (UBER) has considered a takeover bid. The Financial Times said that Uber executives "approached advisers in recent months" about a potential takeover bid of Expedia, and that "there are no current discussions." Shares of Uber are sliding by about 3%. Netflix (NFLX) shares are edging higher in premarket trading as investors anticipate the after-the-bell release of the streaming giant's third-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project Netflix will report a 33% year-over-year jump in net income to $2.24 billion, while its expected revenue of $9.77 billion would be a 14% improvement. Investors also will be watching for Netflix's subscriber totals, which are expected to increase by 4 million from the prior quarter and over 30 million more than last year to reach 282 million. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) warned that its operations would be impacted by the damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton that hit the Southeast recently, and that low fuel prices and sagging demand for coal could lead to a $200 million fourth-quarter hit. For the third quarter, CSX reported earnings per share (EPS) of 46 cents on revenue of $3.62 billion, below analysts' estimates of 48 cents on revenue of $3.68 billion. Its shares are about 5% lower in premarket trading. Investors are watching United Airlines (UAL) after its shares reached their highest levels in more than four years Wednesday. United stock jumped more than 12% in the prior session after it announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, its first since the pandemic, and it reported quarterly earnings above estimates. United Airline shares are little changed in premarket trading.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

U.S.-listed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares jumped 9% Thursday morning after the chipmaker posted robust quarterly earnings and projected a buoyant outlook on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported a 54% year-over-year rise in third-quarter net income of 325.26 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion), up from NT$211 billion. The profit figure by the world's largest contract chip manufacturer beat the NT$300.78 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. TSMC also reported a 39% jump in revenue to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion) for the quarter and a 57.8% gross margin, above analysts' estimates and the guidance it gave for both in the second quarter. "Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies," TSMC Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wendell Huang said. "Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies." TSMC's upbeat earnings, in contrast to Dutch semiconductor-gear manufacturer ASML Holding's (ASML) downbeat outlook earlier in the week, restored investor faith in the AI boom Thursday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all rose. TSMC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei called the demand for AI “real" in the earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. TSMC American depositary receipts (ADRs) have almost doubled this year.UPDATE—Oct. 17, 2024: This article has been updated to include a comment from the CEO and a refreshed share price.

Title: Down 5%, What's Happening With Nvidia Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/17/why-did-nvidia-stock-fall-5/

POLAND - 2024/09/30: In this photo illustration, a Nvidia logo is displayed on a smartphone with ... [+] binary code in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell by close to 4.5% on Tuesday. Peer AMD stock also saw a sharp decline, falling by about 5%. The selloff follows an earnings report by chip manufacturing equipment supplier ASML which indicated weaker-than-expected sales guidance for 2025, raising concerns among investors about global chip demand. ASML produces highly sophisticated photolithography machines, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography equipment, which is essential for manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductor chips including the GPUs that Nvidia sells. ASML said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in at between Euro 30 billion to 35 billion, which is toward the bottom end of its previous forecast, with gross margin forecasts also coming in below estimates. Now, although the decline in guidance was attributed to slower chip demand recovery outside of the AI sector, Nvidia, being the world’s biggest semiconductor company by market cap, was impacted considerably. Additionally, there have been reports that the Biden administration may restrict sales of advanced AI processors to some Persian Gulf countries, citing national security concerns. This stems from worries that these countries could act as a conduit for China to acquire U.S. semiconductor technology that is currently banned from direct export to China. While Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution, Here’s A Better AI Pick Than Nvidia stock The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? To be fair, Nvidia’s sharp stock decline on Tuesday may have been an overreaction. Much of the capital expenditure cuts that are likely impacting ASML potentially come from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung foundries, rather than from TSMC, Nvidia’s primary manufacturing partner. However, Nvidia stock still appears pricey. At its current market price of $132 per share, the stock trades at about 46x consensus FY’25 earnings and 33x FY’26 earnings. There are also risks ahead. See our scenario analysis on Could Nvidia Stock Crash To $40? The big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs. Competition is also mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, the economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenue. There are concerns that companies are investing in AI due to the fear of missing out, rather than focusing on returns. This could eventually lead to reduced capital spending and impact Nvidia, We value NVDA stock at $88 per share, about 33% below the current market price.

Title: JPMorgan Chase is winning the AI banking race — and its lead is getting bigger

JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.42%) held onto its spot as the artificial intelligence adoption leader in the banking sector. The largest U.S. bank has the highest volume of AI talent, which has grown 16% in the past 12 months, and has more AI researchers than its seven biggest competitors combined, according to the latest Evident AI Index, released Thursday. “JPMorganChase is unquestionably still the bank to beat when it comes to AI maturity,” said Evident co-founder and co-CEO Annabel Ayles. “The pace of its AI adoption is remarkable for an organization of its size and scale.” JPMorgan had been investing in AI for years before the chatbot craze took hold with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. The financial institution hired its head of AI research, Manuela Veloso, in 2018 and has since grown its use cases to more than 400. And JPMorgan is already beginning to see the dollar value of its commitment. Company President Daniel Pinto said last month that the bank is expecting to see nearly $2 billion in returns from its investment into the technology this year, particularly related to fraud prevention. “Going forward, we think that artificial intelligence, large language models will have — and we are doing a lot of work on this over the medium- to long-term — a big impact in improving processes and efficiencies in the operational services that we have,” Pinto said. Since Evident began its rankings in early 2023, the top four banks have not only remained in their positions but have continued to plow forward. “The leaders are just pulling ahead and leading more,” Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident co-founder and co-CEO, said in an interview. Evident evaluates 50 major banks in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific based on public data relating to AI adoption, scoring the institutions based on talent, innovation, transparency, and leadership. While all 50 banks in the index have ramped up their adoption efforts since last year, the top 10 are improving twice as fast as the rest of the field, Evident found. Mousavizadeh said banks that are committing to AI are going all in: hiring, poaching talent, figuring out internal systems, testing, and partnering with major players such as Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.33%). “We can see these dynamics are creating bifurcation in the banking system,” Mousavizadeh said. “If you are slightly standing still, at what point does it become almost impossible to catch up? I would say we’re 18 months away from that.” A number of banks are doing the opposite of standing still. The biggest riser in this year’s index is Morgan Stanley (MS+1.36%), which jumped seven points and landed itself a spot in the top 10. The investment bank first partnered with OpenAI in March 2023, when it became the AI startup’s only wealth management partner. The firm rolled out the AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, a generative AI chatbot that helped financial advisors access the bank’s vast array of technical know-how, in September 2023. And this past June, the bank rolled out Debrief, a generative AI assistant that will support its financial advisors, built on OpenAI’s GPT-4. “The rise of HSBC (HSBC+0.79%) and Morgan Stanley show that it’s still possible for banks that have been slower out of the gates on AI to catch up and even overtake the field,” Ayles said. “The race for AI adoption is far from run, but there’s a growing gap between the leaders and the rest of the field. The lower ranking institutions need to pick up the pace if they wish to go the distance.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

getty Now that high inflation has subsided and interest rates are falling, you may be looking to reposition your portfolio for growth. Let's explore three sectors and six growth stocks that could deliver on your long-term wealth creation goals. For patient investors, long-term growth stocks have upside. First, long holding periods minimize trading fees. Lower taxes can also result, especially with growth stocks that aren't paying dividends. Additionally, long holding periods are easier to manage and can encourage higher returns. Investors who aren't timing the market don't have to monitor and evaluate every headline. They also don't have to feel anxious about market downturns. They can simply do nothing and wait for the market to recover. Most importantly, long-term growth stocks can produce real wealth through compound returns. Compounding happens when stock price gains begin appreciating. The gains-on-gains phenomenon escalates growth potential over time, without further contributions. Economic trends shape the future of the growth economy. Understanding those trends can help you focus your research on sectors that are most likely to expand. Currently, the outlook is strong for technology, healthcare and energy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting high job growth in these sectors based on three expected trends: Keeping the sector trends in mind, I identified six top growth stocks by screening U.S. public companies on these criteria: Combined, these qualities describe companies that have growth histories, strong outlooks, rising ROEs, manageable debt and the scale to absorb economic downturns. To finalize the best growth stock picks, I ordered the resulting list from the highest to lowest five-year EPS growth outlook. I then selected the top two from each of the targeted sectors.

First Solar provides photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company's thin PV modules have a lower carbon footprint than conventional crystalline silicon PV panels. The International Energy Agency expects solar power to deliver 80% of the growth in global renewable energy capacity between now and 2030. Rooftop solar systems plus the construction of major solar power plants will contribute. First Solar is the largest U.S. producer of solar panels, primarily serving industrial applications. First Solar's share price dipped in early October after two analysts lowered their price targets. The analysts from Jefferies and Bank of America held their buy ratings on FSLR but noted a few short-term headwinds. These included potential supply chain issues, labor shortages and regulatory concerns. For long-term solar investors, this pullback probably creates a buying opportunity. First Solar's second-quarter earnings highlights, reported in July, included 25% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and a doubling of diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. Boston Scientific makes medical devices that diagnose and treat various conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, coronary artery disease and some forms of cancer. Customers include hospitals, clinics, medical offices and outpatient facilities around the world. At least four analysts have raised their price targets for BSX in recent weeks. One factor driving the excitement is Boston Scientific's planned early presentation of its transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) data. Analysts assume the expedited release signals confidence in the results of the company's study on its Acurate Transfemoral Aortic Valve System for TAVR. TAVR treats the narrowing of the aortic valve less invasively than open-heart surgery. Grand View Research has predicted the global TAVR market will grow at a CAGR of 7.2% between 2024 and 2030. Boston Scientific also recently closed on the acquisition of Silk Road Medical. The transaction is expected to be accretive to BSX's adjusted EPS in 2026 and beyond. In its second quarter 2024, Boston Scientific grew revenues by 14.5% and EPS by 22% from the prior-year period. Medpace is a clinical research organization that runs clinical trials for customers in the biotech, pharma and medical device industries. Customers are primarily small to mid-sized biopharma companies that do not have the resources required to run clinical trials in-house. The per-share price of Medpace has pulled back more than 20% since its earnings release in July. Analysts have also lowered their price targets. The good news is that these developments are related to temporary circumstances. Analysts are primarily concerned with slow biotech funding and deal flow, plus a decline in MEDP's bookings this year. UBS analyst Dan Leonard, as quoted by Business Insider, believes Medpace will grow faster than peers in the long term, even if the short-term pace is dampened by poor market conditions. In the second quarter 2024, Medpace grew revenue by 14.6%, backlog by 13.7% and diluted EPS by 42% versus the prior-year quarter. Schlumberger provides technology services for the oil and gas industry. From flow-rate measurement services to exploration data processing, the company's software and hardware solutions are designed to increase efficiency and streamline operations for oil and gas companies. As with Medpace, analysts covering Schlumberger have lowered price targets but remain bullish on the stock long term. A question mark in the immediate term is the outlook for oil prices. Falling oil prices could lessen production, which would be a headwind for Schlumberger. Despite analysts' reductions, the average price target on SLB still represents 42% upside. Schlumberger recently grew quarterly revenues by 13%, adjusted Ebitda by 17% and adjusted diluted EPS by 18% versus the prior-year period. You can maximize your portfolio's appreciation potential with growth stocks that operate within expanding economic sectors. Once you have those companies in your portfolio, stay patient and focused on the long term. Let compounding work its magic and it can deliver measurable increases in your net worth over time.

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years.

The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services. Apple's product line includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch and various services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become a significant player in the cloud computing market, competing directly with Amazon Web Services. Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms. The company's flagship products include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. In recent years, Meta has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality technologies, signaling its ambition to lead the development of the "metaverse."

Nvidia, founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a technology company best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and professional markets. In recent years, Nvidia has become a significant player in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

Title: TSMC is making chips for Apple in the U.S.
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-make-a16-chips-apple-arizona-fab-ai-taiwan-semis-1851673965
Time Published: 2024-10-16T17:50:06Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona. The chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. “The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL+1.23%) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. TSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan. It’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said. The Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility. The company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Jim Cramer has recently discussed the resilience of the "Magnificent Seven" and Netflix (NFLX, Financial) as the overall index continues to climb. Among these top performers are Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Alphabet(GOOGL, Financial), Apple (AAPL, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), Meta Platforms (META, Financial), and Tesla (TSLA, Financial). Cramer highlighted effective rebounds following recent dips. He specifically pointed to Nvidia and Apple as buy-and-hold opportunities due to their robust fundamentals despite share price volatility. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TSLA. Cramer expressed optimism about Apple's prospects in China, downplaying the skepticism around its operations there. However, he was more cautious about Alphabet, citing ongoing antitrust cases, yet he remained confident in its potential for a rebound. He praised Amazon's web services and Meta's robust advertising platform as critical drivers of their recent successes. Addressing the rumors affecting Microsoft's AI assistant, Cramer urged for more substantial evidence before dismissing the company's prospects. He also advised against betting against Tesla, noting Elon Musk's proven track record in navigating company controversies. He also mentioned that Netflix has yet to capitalize on its new advertising segment fully. Cramer characterized the current market movement as a tech rally that not only boosts its own sector but also elevates other market segments, aided by recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This marks a departure from previous rallies, suggesting a more supportive environment for widespread market growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

U.S. stock futures are little changed after Tuesday's tech selloff; ASML Holding (ASML) shares are continuing to move lower in premarket trading after the semiconductor-gear manufacturer's stock tanked yesterday as it reported third-quarter results a day earlier than expected; shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are rebounding slightly after stepping back from record highs as chipmakers struggled on industry worries; Stellantis (STLA) reports a 20% decline in Q3 worldwide shipments; and United Airlines (UAL) announces a $1.5 billion share buyback program as it reports better-than-expected earnings. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed in premarket trading Wednesday following a selloff yesterday on sharp declines for technology and energy shares. Crude oil futures are lower after Tuesday's decline amid easing tensions in the Middle East and news that the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its outlook for energy demand growth. Gold futures are higher. New York Registry Shares of ASML Holding (ASML) are declining a further 3% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker projected that its 2025 net sales would come in lower than previously projected. The company released its earnings report a day early on Tuesday, revealing a weaker-than-expected outlook, which sent its shares tumbling 16%. The company also reported third-quarter net bookings that were well below analyst estimates. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are up about 1% in premarket trading after the tech giant's shares fell nearly 5% Tuesday. Shares had reached an all-time closing high the prior session after bullish comments from analysts who cited the chipmaker's dominance in the accelerator market. Investors also were spooked yesterday by a report that the U.S. could curb AI chip sales to some Middle East countries. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also are rebounding slightly after dropping 5% Tuesday. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) reported shipments dropped 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, including a 36% decline in deliveries to North America amid high dealer inventory levels. The results come soon after the maker of Jeep and Chrysler issued a profit warning, citing "deterioration in global industry dynamics" and competition from Chinese rivals. Shares of Stellantis are edging higher in premarket trading. United Airlines (UAL) announced a $1.5 billion share buyback plan while reporting third-quarter earnings that were better than analyst estimates. The airline posted quarterly revenue of $14.84 billion, better than consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.33 also beat projections. United's results stand in contrast to the weaker-than-expected earnings from rival Delta Air Lines (DAL). Shares of United are up by more than 1% in premarket trading.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

US stocks were muted on Wednesday as investors digested results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide.

US stock futures took a breather on Wednesday as investors waited for results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. Futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) hugged the flatline, while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down 0.1%. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Eyes are on Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell for signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. A strong showing would give weight to optimism that the US economy is headed for a "soft landing". At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere.

Title: Tech is leading markets higher — but 3 other sectors have joined in: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings There's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company. Though the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees. More significantly, the so-called "fins" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5. All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%). It might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that "tech is leading" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the "Magnificent Seven." But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors. It's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, "Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market." Ralph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept. "Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next," said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading. Woods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs. "I hate that I like Cisco right now," Woods said. "I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing." In fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records. For that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively. Many of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found. "Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout," Woods said, adding, "[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore." On Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation, Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape, providing you with the critical context needed to make the right decisions for your portfolio.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC) is expected to beat revenue expectations for the third quarter when it reports quarterly earnings Thursday. The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple is losing out to Huawei in China. Here's why

Since releasing its Mate 60 Pro series last August, Chinese tech giant Huawei has made a comeback in China’s smartphone market, knocking Apple (AAPL+1.23%) from its pedestal. Huawei and other homegrown smartphone makers have experienced double-digit growth this year, boosting smartphone shipments in China by 8.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. China’s Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Honor — a former subsidiary of Huawei — and Xiaomi made up the top sharers of China’s smartphone market, respectively. Apple, meanwhile, fell to sixth place. And despite cutting prices on some iPhone models to compete, the data showed Apple’s year-over-year sales declined 3.1%. Apple’s iPhone shipments in China experienced “marginal decline” in the second quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research said, noting that during the same period last year, Apple had the third-highest number of shipments — only behind Oppo and Vivo — while Huawei was in sixth place. Apple’s fall in China can be tied to many factors, experts said, including the country’s faltering economy and changes in how its citizens view their country versus the rest of the world amid the pandemic and the growing number of sanctions imposed by the West. “There’s a higher degree of nationalist sentiment right now within China, of buying local and buying the home team versus buying an American product,” Arthur Dong, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz. Since Huawei was placed on the U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 under former President Donald Trump, the company has faced increasingly tough trade restrictions under President Joe Biden — especially on the latest generation of semiconductors such as those from Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%), Dong said. Escalating trade rules on China and Huawei are putting the tech company, which has ties to the Chinese government and which Dong called “a national champion for the Chinese economy,” “in a tough spot right now.” “Huawei is scrambling right now to try to find alternative sources for these all-important chips, as well as some very significant self-development efforts to try to replicate these technologies and build chips on their own,” Dong said. “With regard to that issue, China is having a really difficult time being able to replicate the chips that sort of fuel AI advancements simply because they don’t have access to the tools and the machinery that build these chips, all of which are within the confines of U.S. export controls.” Dong said he doesn’t see the current situation getting better for Huawei. With another round of restrictions expected over the next few months, the “gaps” that China and Huawei depend on to move around sanctions “are going to be closed,” he said. In the early 2010s, Apple was seen as a “legitimate, ultimate symbol of status,” Andy Tsay, professor of business and analytics at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, told Quartz. Tsay, who is also a visiting professor in Peking University’s MBA program, said his friends in China would “place their orders” with him for iPhones because Apple’s products were more difficult to find there and there were shortages. Now, there are more Apple Stores in the country. “There really was no comparison, no competitor,” Tsay, who has visited China roughly every year since 2006, said. “Now, people still think Apple is a fine and legitimate luxury product. But the difference is, they’re not fanboys and fangirls anymore.” On his most recent visit to China a few months ago, Tsay asked his MBA students, part of China’s professional class, what they thought about their iPhones. While his students told him that they are satisfied with their iPhones, they also said their next phone “won’t necessarily be an Apple,” and that “there are some Chinese options that are pretty good.” “I’ll get whichever phone has the best price-to-benefit ratio,” Tsay’s students told him. In 2020, Huawei had 18% of the world market for smartphones, Dong said. Two years later, that number fell to 2%, largely because Huawei was restricted from necessary chips and components, he said, and he doesn’t see the company rebounding soon. “They’re still facing challenges in the Chinese market because the overall consumer economy of China has gone into a tailspin,” Dong said. “Apple’s problems are mostly related to the fact that the Chinese consumer has gone into hibernation and they can’t afford this kind of phone because their entire economy is, in a sense, collapsing.” Huawei’s growing sales are “only because their phones are a lot cheaper than Apple’s phones,” Dong said. If Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are offering cheaper alternatives, consumers will want those smartphones, he added. China is “more isolated” than it was during its superpower status in the 2010s, Tsay said, likely due to anti-Chinese sentiments stemming from the pandemic. Meanwhile, companies are “trying to extricate themselves from being too reliant on China,” and Western governments continue to ban China’s access to certain technologies, such as equipment to build advanced semiconductors. “You combine that all together with the rise of domestic products, and if people, locally, can feel a little bit good about themselves by supporting the home team, there’s a little bit of something in the trend,” Tsay said. There are two views of the AI chips in Huawei’s smartphones, Dong said. “On the one hand, it could send us an alarming signal that China has the ability to create their homegrown chips,” Dong said. “But there are other stories that you will see where these chips have been examined and the engineering analysis on them is that they’re not even close to the capabilities of what Nvidia is producing — that it’s actually several generations and years behind.” Despite Huawei’s “headline-grabbing” announcements about developing its own chips, Dong said he finds it difficult to imagine how the company has made its advanced chips without access to critical machines and components under trade restrictions. “This is perhaps more bark and less bite when it comes to this announcement that they have advanced-level chips,” Dong said. The competition between Apple and Huawei in China is also tied to the difference in what Apple can offer its U.S. consumers versus its Chinese consumers, Tsay said. Apple’s advantage in the U.S. is its control over its ecosystem, according to Tsay, allowing it to deliver a differentiated user experience. China, however, has a “unique situation” where its “version” of Apple’s iOS is WeChat. “You almost don’t need the tightly integrated, walled garden of the Apple ecosystem in China to deliver that experience because it already exists inside the WeChat world,” Tsay said. “That gives the local cell phone companies an advantage in the sense that they can use Android or their own version of Android or a brand new operating system — they don’t need to create that self-contained ecosystem that Apple has so painstakingly created over the years because Tencent (TCEHY+4.36%) already did it for them by creating WeChat.” The one place the two companies differ, Tsay said, is with Apple’s security and privacy features. “Of course, nobody in China has any expectation of security and privacy when they are online,” he said.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Retreats From Record

Nvidia (NVDA) shares will likely remain on investors’ radar screens after falling sharply Tuesday, just a day after setting a record closing high. The decline Tuesday came as Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is mulling AI chip export curbs to some Middle Eastern countries. The news tempered optimism about surging demand for Nvidia's chips from tech giants hyperscaling their AI infrastructure amid a backdrop of tight supply. Nvidia shares fell 4.7% Tuesday to close at $131.60. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors will likely be watching. Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle between June and September before breaking out above the pattern earlier this month. Although the breakout signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend, it’s worth pointing out that the move occurred on below-average volume, indicating a lack of conviction behind the move. Conversely, Tuesday’s selling registered the highest daily share turnover in nearly a month, raising the possibility of a potential bull trap, a trading event that lures investors into buying a breakout before the price makes a sudden reversal. Let’s take a look at three important support levels on the AI chipmaker’s chart and also use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH). The first sits around $125, where the shares find a confluence of support from the symmetrical triangle’s top trendline and a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between early June and late September. A decisive breakdown below this level would confirm a bull trap, which could trigger a move down to the $115 level, where the stock may encounter buying interest near the triangle’s lower trendline and multiple minor peaks and troughs stretching back to late May. Further selling could see the shares revisit major support around $97, a location on the chart currently just below the upward sloping 200-day moving average (MA) where investors could look for buying opportunities near the twin March peaks and prices situated just above the August low. Investors can forecast a bullish price target above the stock’s ATH by using a measured move, also referred to by chartists as the measuring principle. This works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s trendlines near the start of the pattern and adding that amount to the breakout point. In other words, we add $50 to $127, which projects a price target of $177. The forecast, around 34% above Tuesday’s close, indicates a potential area on the chart where investors may be happy to lock in profits.

Title: Jim Cramer on NVIDIA (NVDA): ‘I Have Never Seen’ a Company With Such Demand for Its Products

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds. “We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.” Cramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding. “This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.” For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Talking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips: “They are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn’t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.” Cramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing: “I’ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.” Nvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
