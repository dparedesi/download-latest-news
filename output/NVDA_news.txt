Title: Oracle's Post-Earnings Plunge Is Dragging These Tech Stocks Down With It

Oracle's (ORCL) stock tumbled Thursday, dragging other tech stocks down along with it, a day after the cloud computing giant posted sales that missed analysts' estimates. Oracle said new agreements with AI heavyweights Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) helped grow its backlog to a record $523 billion, though that failed to sway investors from selling off Thursday amid persistent worries about circular AI deals and the company's reliance on a few large customers. Shares of Oracle were down nearly 14% in recent trading. AI hardware makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO)—which is set to report earnings after the closing bell today—also lost ground. Oracle shares rallied to a record high following its earnings report in September, but the stock has given up those gains in the months since amid growing worries about an AI bubble. Oracle's stock plunge Thursday despite a record backlog and pressure on other AI-exposed stocks could be taken as a signal of weakening confidence in the AI trade. Still, most Wall Street analysts say they're standing by Oracle's stock. Though ratings are still in flux, a majority of the 12 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha consider the stock a "buy" with just three neutral ratings and one analyst advising selling the stock. William Blair analysts wrote following the report that while they expect Oracle's stock could be limited in the near term by debt concerns and spending plans, they believe its buildout "will pave the way for significant earnings growth in the years to come."

Title: Bitcoin and equity futures fall alongside mining stocks as Oracle leads AI stock decline
URL: https://blockspace.media/insight/bitcoin-and-equity-futures-fall-alongside-mining-stocks-as-oracle-leads-ai-stock-decline/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T15:09:49Z

Cryptocurrency prices and equity futures retreated on Thursday morning, signaling a negative start for major indices. Bitcoin fell 2.11% to $90,090, setting a bearish tone for digital asset miners, while a sharp decline in Oracle shares weighed heavily on the broader AI sector. Bitcoin mining equities tracked the drop in spot cryptocurrency prices, facing widespread losses in pre-market trading. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) led the decline, falling 3.03% and 3.19%, respectively. MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) dropped 2.6%, while TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) and IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) posted losses of roughly 2.5% each. Other industry participants followed the sector-wide sell-off. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) dropped 2.38%, Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) declined 2.02%, and Americant Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) fell 1.04%. Artificial intelligence stocks faced significant selling pressure, driven primarily by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which plummeted 13.18%. A Reuters report on December 11 revealed that the sell-off came after Oracle’s quarterly cloud revenue miss, despite year-over-year growth. Compounding investor concerns, the company raised its capital expenditure outlook to $50 billion for 2026 to fund AI infrastructure, a move market observers noted would add to an existing debt load. The negative sentiment impacted other AI leaders, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) falling 1.59%. Oracle also highlighted reliance on a limited number of large partners, such as OpenAI, raising concerns regarding concentration risk. The weakness in tech and crypto dragged down broader market futures. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.32% and Nasdaq futures decreased 0.52% in early trading hours, positioning the markets for a lower open.

Title: Nvidia’s ‘Secret Portfolio’ Is Tanking. This Is the Only Stock Still Winning

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / rafapress Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quietly built a strategic investment portfolio not many investors are aware of targeting companies that enhance its AI ecosystem, from chip design to data infrastructure. This “secret” portfolio holds six positions that were valued at $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. These stakes back firms developing complementary technologies, such as GPU-optimized cloud services and AI-driven biotech. However, Q3 brought challenges amid a broader AI market pause, with hyperscalers reassessing capex and investor sentiment cooling. The portfolio shed nearly $500 million in the quarter, an 11% drop, as four of six holdings declined, most sharply. Since Q3 ended in September, though, the slide deepened, with the overall value plunging 30% more to about $2.7 billion — a $1.1 billion loss. Only one holding defied the trend: Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD). Nvidia’s portfolio woes stem largely from its largest bet, the AI cloud provider reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for training large models, CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV). At Q2’s close, Nvidia’s 24.3 million shares were worth $3.96 billion, over 91% of the portfolio. But CoreWeave’s stock has cratered amid debt concerns and AI hype fatigue. Since Q3’s end, it’s down 36%, and 46% from Q2 levels, now trading around $88 per share after peaking at $187 earlier in 2025. This single position accounts for most of the portfolio’s quarter-over-quarter decline. Other holdings fared little better. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), a chip architecture designer, slipped 12.5% since Q3 amid slower mobile demand. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX), using AI for drug discovery, dropped 5.7% on clinical trial delays, and WeRide (NASDAQ:WRD), an autonomous driving firm, fell 17% as regulatory hurdles mounted. The portfolio’s diversification into AI adjacencies hasn’t shielded it from sector-wide pressures like rising energy costs and delayed enterprise rollouts. Amid the rubble, two positions posted gains, with Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) delivering solid returns. Formerly tied to former Russian search giant Yandex, Nebius now builds AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters. Nvidia’s 1.2 million shares, valued at $65.9 million at the end of Q2, have surged 69% since then, boosted by a $17 billion Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) deal for cloud capacity. Nebius’s Q3 revenue jumped 355% year-over-year to $146 million, underscoring its switch to AI hyperscaler needs. However, the stock has fallen 17% since the end of Q3. Yet Applied Digital outpaces even Nebius as the portfolio’s undisputed star. Nvidia’s 7.7 million shares, worth $77.7 million at Q2 close, have rocketed 128% quarter-over-quarter and another 35% since Q3, for a staggering 208% total gain. Now valued at over $239 million, this stake has single-handedly offset some broader losses. Applied Digital designs and operates data centers tailored for high-performance computing, powering AI and blockchain workloads. Its Polaris Forge campus in North Dakota delivers 100 megawatts of capacity, drawing clients like CoreWeave for GPU-intensive builds. In a market where AI stocks like CoreWeave and even Arm are falling, sometimes as much as 40% or more, Applied Digital’s ability to keep going stands out. Its fiscal Q1 2026 results, reported in October, crushed Wall Street estimates. Revenue hit $64.2 million, up 84% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $5.85 million. Net losses narrowed to $36.1 million, far better than feared. The main driver was relentless data center demand. AI training requires massive, power-efficient facilities, and Applied Digital benefits directly from hyperscaler buildouts, including contracts with CoreWeave for colocation. Its sustainable designs, using renewable energy, align with ESG mandates that pressure rivals. Crypto also added tailwinds. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) demand spiked after the halving, especially as its price briefly soared above $126,000, contributing to increased demand for data center capacity. As pure AI plays pause amid valuation resets, Applied Digital’s hybrid model — 60% high-performance computing and AI, 40% crypto — provides a buffer. Analysts project 28% EBITDA growth in fiscal 2026, with $16 billion in existing five-year leases, giving it good visibility into revenue for the years ahead. Trading at 30x forward sales, it’s carrying a lot of investor expectations with it. Although Applied Digital is still generating losses, they narrowed significantly in Q3 and it projects an annual net operating income run rate of $1 billion by 2030. Applied Digital’s outperformance is the result of focused execution. However, its continued success depends on navigating the AI slowdown, potentially crimping data center leases if clients like Microsoft trim budgets. The crypto winter could bite as well, as Bitcoin’s near-30% pullback echoes 2022’s bear market, possibly idling mining rigs and pressuring margins. Still, the upside potential outweighs risks. Nvidia’s endorsement validates its tech, so if AI capex continues strong next year — as Nvidia forecasts it will — Applied Digital could double again. However, having tripled in six months, it’s no secret anymore: in Nvidia’s tanking portfolio, this is the winner worth watching. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

Title: Micron Stock Has Gained More Than 200% This Year. Why Experts See Additional Record Highs on the Horizon.

One of the hottest AI stocks appears to have more room to run. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) have surged to all-time highs this week as analysts continue to raise their targets for the memory chip maker ahead of next week's earnings report. Citi analysts on Wednesday lifted their price target to $300 from $275, now double where their target for the stock was in early September. The analysts said the increasing demand for the advanced memory chips used to run artificial intelligence models should help bring in "large capital infusions" that help Micron and other memory chip makers boost their manufacturing capabilities to meet demand. Micron shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to a record closing high of just below $264. The stock price has more than tripled since the start of the year. Micron supplies memory components to other manufacturers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), making Micron one of many beneficiaries of the AI trade. Micron is the top performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year, and only four stocks in the S&P 500 have posted bigger gains in 2025. Artificial intelligence companies are looking to buy the chips as fast as they can be made, leading to a shortage of memory chips that Citi analysts say is causing "unprecedented increases" in pricing, which should further boost Micron's sales and profits. Deutsche Bank analysts on Tuesday hiked their own price target to $280 from $200, calling Micron "well poised to benefit" from changes in the memory-chip market. The analysts also called Micron "particularly attractive among the memory names given its unique ability to prioritize profitability over market share in this environment." Morgan Stanley analysts raised their own price target for Micron last month to $325 from $220 after upgrading the stock in October, calling the memory chip maker a "top pick" because of how that dramatic increase in pricing for memory products could boost sales and profits in the next year, even if prices start to normalize. Analysts are largely bullish on Micron stock, but its average price target suggest that some analysts think the chip maker's stock has hit its ceiling, or are waiting until after next week's report to adjust their view. The 11 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha are split between nine "buy" and two "hold" ratings, with the average price target among those analysts at around $237.

Title: Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/will-nvidia-nvda-stock-hit-500-by-2030/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:18:03Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable. There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though? The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable. Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short. As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever. Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options. If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors? From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home. In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending. Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999. The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China. If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.” The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests. It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders. Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside. Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat. All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor. Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: QYLD Turns Mag 7 Tech Stocks Into an 11% Dividend Yield
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/qyld-turns-mag-7-tech-stocks-into-an-11-dividend-yield/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:48:19Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) transforms the Nasdaq-100’s top technology stocks into an 11% monthly dividend by selling covered call options against its holdings. Unlike traditional dividend ETFs, QYLD generates income exclusively through option premiums. The fund sells near-the-money call options on its entire portfolio each month, collecting premiums from buyers who purchase the right to buy shares at specific strike prices. This strategy produces consistent monthly income but caps upside participation when tech stocks rally sharply. The fund’s $8 billion portfolio concentrates heavily in technology at 57% of the total ETF, and communication services at 17%. The top holdings – Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms – represent over half the fund and drive most option premium generation. QYLD’s 11.5% yield depends entirely on market volatility, not underlying dividends. The fund’s top holdings pay minimal natural yields: NVDA offers just 0.02%, AAPL 0.37%, and MSFT 0.70%. Amazon pays no dividend. This means QYLD’s monthly distributions fluctuate based on option premium levels, which compress during low-volatility periods. Recent dividend history reveals declining payouts. Monthly distributions averaged $0.198 in 2021 but have dropped 17% to approximately $0.169 currently. This decline reflects lower implied volatility in tech stocks as markets stabilized following pandemic-era swings. When volatility decreases, call options command lower premiums, directly reducing QYLD’s distributable income. The fund’s structure also creates total return concerns. While delivering high current income, QYLD’s net asset value has eroded 23% from its December 2021 peak of $22.82 to the current $17.54. This capital depreciation occurs because covered calls cap participation in bull market rallies. When tech stocks surge—as they did throughout 2023-2024—QYLD surrenders upside gains beyond strike prices. Investors receive steady income but miss appreciation that Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) holders capture fully. The concentration in highly valued tech stocks adds risk. NVDA trades at 46 times earnings with a beta of 2.28, creating extreme volatility that generates premiums but exposes the fund to sharp drawdowns. The April 2025 drop to $14.48 demonstrated this downside vulnerability. Income reliability remains strong—QYLD has paid monthly since 2013 without interruption. However, distribution amounts fluctuate with market conditions, and the declining trend suggests caution for investors expecting stable 11% yields indefinitely. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPI) offers a more diversified approach to option income generation. Rather than concentrating in tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, JEPI writes calls on a broader S&P 500-based portfolio with lower volatility stocks. The fund currently yields approximately 7.4% with more stable monthly distributions and less exposure to mega-cap tech concentration risk. JEPI combines equity-linked notes with covered calls, providing flexibility to adjust option strategies based on market conditions while maintaining consistent income generation.

Title: Pro-AI super PAC launches first candidate ads | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/tech/pro-ai-super-pac-launches-first-candidate-ads
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:24:51Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A new pro-AI network of political action committees is releasing its first candidate ads in the 2026 midterms, as the debate around artificial intelligence ramps up ahead of the elections. The ads from Leading the Future, a pro-AI bipartisan network of associated PACs, focus on congressional races in Texas and New York and are a likely preview of the vast amounts of money the technology industry could spend ahead of next year’s elections. The ads were shared first with CNN. Leading the Future said these ads are the “opening phase” of its effort in the upcoming midterm elections; the two ads are part of seven-figure ad campaign for the respective primaries, with more to come, the group told CNN. Other groups are also breaking out their wallets: Two former members of Congress, Democrat Brad Carson and Republican Chris Stewart, have joined forces to create a new organization called Public First, and network of super PACs that will back efforts and candidates who want to regulate AI. Meta recently launched its own bipartisan super PAC called American Technology Excellence Project, which aims in part to counter efforts to regulate AI at the state level. The stakes are enormous: In just a few years, AI has become a major driver of the US stock market and a force in the economy, as well as a major player in people’s everyday lives. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first $5 trillion company earlier this year after demand for its products surged. Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Oracle, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech companies have poured billions of dollars into hiring, research and development of AI products, looking for ways to secure a lead in the AI race and dominate a still-growing market. But critics say the rush to build ever-more complex AI models carries enormous risks in areas like privacy and child safety, with a regulatory framework that lags far behind the rapid advances in technology. And even some tech pioneers warn that AI poses potential dangers to the economy and to the world. Recent polling from the Pew Research Center released in November shows nearly identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats say they are more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life. And in September, Gallup found 80% of US adults “believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly.” Leading the Future advocates for a federal regulatory framework on AI instead of state level regulations – a policy favored by the industry and President Donald Trump’s administration. On Monday, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level in favor of a federal level “rulebook,” though it’s not clear what that would look like. The Trump administration argues state regulations threaten to stymie America’s AI industry, which is a national security priority. Congress could take up a possible framework for AI regulation within the next year – House Democrats announced on Tuesday they are setting up a Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy to “develop policy expertise in partnership” with AI companies and other stakeholders. Leading the Future’s new ads underscore this divide, with one ad in support of a Texas candidate and another targeting a New York candidate. One ad supports Chris Gober, a lawyer running in the Republican primary for the new Texas 10th congressional district. The ad calls Gober, who previously worked with Elon Musk on his America Super PAC as well as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a stalwart “Trump conservative.” Though the ad is paid for by American Mission, part of Leading the Future’s network, it does not mention AI directly, only referring to “promoting American technology investment” in the race to beat China. Gober told CNN in an email that he’s running to “champion” the “world-class innovators” in his district and to promote policies “that ensure America wins the global technology race.” The second ad targets New York State Assemblyman Alex Bores, who is running in New York’s 12th congressional district and has made a name for himself as an outspoken voice for AI safety guardrails. And unlike Gober’s ad, the ad targeting Bores from Leading the Future’s Think Big PAC leans heavily into criticizing Bores for wanting to regulate AI at the state level. In response, Bores criticized President Trump’s recent actions on AI and what he called a “handful of AI billionaires” angry because he “would dare to stand up to them to protect our jobs, our kids’ minds, and our security.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Big Bubbles Are Not Deterring Bullish Investors

Almost nothing seems to rattle individual investors lately. They’ve overcome fears about tariffs, inflation, and a potential stock market bubble, continuing to buy their favorite stocks and ETFs all year long. Despite concerns about economic policy, overvaluations in AI stocks, and rising prices, investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market right now, according to Investopedia’s recent survey. More than 60% describe themselves as either optimistic or cautiously optimistic, while less than a third say they are skeptical or hesitant. The late November selloff across the biggest stocks in the market—like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Palantir (PLTR)—did not deter investor optimism. In fact, it may have emboldened them to buy more, adding to their positions in the most widely held stocks in their investors’ portfolios. According to the Schwab Trading Activity Index, or STAX, Schwab clients took advantage of the drawdowns in those mega-cap stocks and bought the dip at one of the fastest paces in history. They did so even though the majority of respondents to our survey think that AI-related stocks are in a bubble, and nearly half feel the same way about the biggest tech stocks in the market. More than half also believe cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are frothy, despite the 25% decline in the price of Bitcoin over the past month. Investors have had plenty to be concerned about throughout 2025. Whether it was the Trump administration’s initially aggressive tariff policies, the rise of Chinese AI model DeepSeek, geopolitical instability in places like the Middle East and Ukraine, or the reliability of government data, headline risk has been the standard all year long. While this may have contributed to increased volatility in the stock market in recent months compared to the past few years, individual investors have mostly stayed the course with their investment strategies. They pulled back slightly on their investing plans during the tariff tantrums last April, but have steadily returned to their normal allocations across the stock market. Concerns about recent market events have also been dissipating, a sign that investors have grown accustomed to more uncertainty. While individual investors are mostly optimistic about the stock market and their portfolios, their trust in this administration continues to wane, and their concerns that its policies will hurt their investments continue to rise. Still, most believe in the relentless rise of the stock market, regardless of who might occupy the Oval Office, and expect annual returns of at least 5% over the next three years. That’s lower than the average annual returns of 14% for the S&P 500 over the past five years, but still optimistic. In yet another sign of investors’ optimism and risk tolerance, most would choose to invest an extra $10,000—if they had it—in individual stocks. They’ve benefitted from owning many of the biggest and fastest-rising stocks in the market for the past several years, and expect that trend to continue for the next decade. Individual investors' portfolios closely mirror the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500, or the top holdings in popular ETFs such as VOO (VOO), SPY (SPY), and QQQ (QQQ). They’ve remained loyal to these stocks, which include the Magnificent 7, as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). Many have become millionaires owning these stocks and have continued to buy them throughout this bull market, which began over three years ago. Their faith in these giant stocks is so strong that not only are they their biggest holdings today, but most would buy and hold the same group of stocks for the next decade. Old habits die hard—especially when the bull keeps running.

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Broadcom Stock to Move After Earnings

Broadcom (AVGO) is slated to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with traders expecting the chipmaker's stock could hit fresh record highs after the report. Based on current options pricing, Broadcom stock is expected to rise or fall by up to 6% by the end of the week. Based on Monday's closing price, that would lift Broadcom's stock to around $425 on the high end, further past the intraday record of $407 the stock set on Monday, or push it down to about $377. Last quarter, Broadcom's revenue hit a record $15.95 billion as the company topped estimates, prompting some analysts to call Broadcom a "Magnificent 8" stock that could continue to grow alongside Nvidia (NVDA) if the AI industry keeps expanding. Broadcom stock rallied following the report, setting multiple record highs in the months since. Broadcom designs AI chips used by several big tech companies—including Google, Meta and OpenAI—to train and run AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Broadcom stock has been less affected than shares of other tech giants by the recent concerns over an AI bubble. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.
