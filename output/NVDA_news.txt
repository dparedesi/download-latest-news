Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Google Reinforces The AI Story

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Google’s parent, Alphabet, provided a strong indication that artificial intelligence (AI) continues ... More to drive spending. Tech heavyweights Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon.com are set to report earnings this week. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 161 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Merck (MRK), Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). Four of the Magnificent 7 are also on the docket this week. According to FactSet, 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 34% of companies having already reported results. S&P 500 Earnings Season Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 6.4% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.6%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.9%. Earnings Estimate Summary The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high last week. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed primarily due to Tesla’s performance. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla entered the earnings season with low expectations, but it failed to impress with its report last week. Tesla was the worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7, falling 4.1% last week. Alphabet, parent of Google, was expected to report robust earnings growth and managed to exceed expectations, sending the stock 4.4% higher for the week. Alphabet’s cloud revenue soared by 31.7% year-over-year, with improving operating margins. Data suggests that their artificial intelligence (AI) search is growing, without the feared decline in monetization. Google increased its planned 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion, reflecting its confidence in the AI outlook, but investors are (rightly) always cautious about massive capital investments. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close on Wednesday, then Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth Positive earnings surprises from the financial and communication services sector were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Capital One Financial (COF) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be limited upside to sales growth from here. Better sales results in the communication services and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with crucial releases this week after a lull last week. The first look at second-quarter US economic growth comes on Wednesday. GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2.4% after a decline in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, the headline GDP number is likely to overstate the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. US GDP Growth The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with essentially no chance of any change to rates. Instead, market participants will be looking for clues as to when the next Fed rate cut will occur. Markets are currently pricing in a 66% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. Fed Rate Cuts Expected News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. Sectoral tariffs could also be announced. As a positive note, a trade deal framework with Japan was announced last week, providing reason for optimism about additional agreements with other nations. Also on Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to continue showing modest but slowing growth in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate is expected to reverse last month’s decline and increase to a still low 4.2%. Stocks & Recession Odds Stocks continue to be boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. The betting odds of a 2025 recession fell to the lowest level of the year, while stocks reached an all-time high.

Title: Here Are Three Questions Investors Want Answered In Big Tech Earnings This Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-are-three-questions-big-tech-earnings-this-week-meta-microsoft-apple-amazon-11779269

Second-quarter earnings season will kick into high gear this week. Four of the world’s largest companies—Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—are set to report their results. Artificial intelligence will be the focus for many investors, who will be hoping for updates on companies' investments in the era-defining technology and how they're using it. But trade policy could also get some airtime, especially during Apple’s and Amazon’s calls on Thursday. Microsoft and Meta kick things off with their reports and earnings calls after the closing bell on Wednesday. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have already turned in results, so after this week the only Magnificent 7 company left to report will be Nvidia (NVDA), in late August. Here are three questions on investors' minds. Six months ago, one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street was whether U.S. tech companies were spending too much on artificial intelligence. That issue appears to be settled—or, at least, on the back burner for now. Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast to $85 billion, citing growing demand for cloud computing products and services; that was generally read as a good thing. Google Cloud grew by more than 30% from the prior year, putting the unit on track to book over $50 billion in revenue within the next year. Cloud computing competitors Microsoft and Amazon could follow Alphabet's lead. Both companies left their capex forecasts unchanged when they reported quarterly results three months ago, decisions that may have been influenced by the trade and economic uncertainty hanging over the market at the time. The companies could be feeling more confident about boosting AI spending now that some of the fog has been lifted by trade agreements. Meta was the odd one out last quarter when it raised its capex outlook. It’s not out of the question that the social media giant will lift its forecast again; it did so in the first and second quarters last year. Investors will be looking for evidence that big investments in AI are paying off. “AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Executives said on the company’s earnings call that Google is monetizing AI search results at about the same rate as it is traditional search, and that AI overviews are driving increased search volume. In recent quarters, Meta has convinced Wall Street that AI is improving ad performance and user engagement. Investors are hoping this week’s results continue to demonstrate that Meta's investments are bearing fruit. Amazon could offer updates on how customers are engaging with Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, and Q, its work assistant. Microsoft is likely to elaborate on the uptake of its Copilot AI offering. As for Apple, experts say, investors may still have to wait for the details they crave. “We don't expect (1) an update on Apple Intelligence timing (2026), (2) any material change in quarterly capex, (3) an update on Apple Intelligence approval in China, and/or (4) any new partnership announcements,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an earnings preview last week. Management might, however, say product sales grew faster in Apple Intelligence-enabled regions than non-AI regions, he said. At least in the near term, Apple investors are likely more concerned with tariffs than most of its Magnificent Seven counterparts. President Donald Trump in April exempted smartphones and other consumer electronics from his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but the president has ordered his administration to consider invoking national security concerns to impose Section 232 duties on smartphones and semiconductors. Section 232 tariffs have held up better in court than Trump’s country-specific duties and could be harder for Apple to avoid. Even with the smartphone exemption, Apple in May estimated tariffs would add $900 million to the company’s costs in the second quarter. Investors will watch for the actual impact and to hear how Apple is engaging with suppliers and the administration to fend off tariffs and mitigate their potential impact. Trade policy will also be top of mind for Amazon investors. In the first quarter, Amazon saw some evidence buyers were stocking up to get ahead of tariffs, which could set the company up for a sequential slowdown in sales. Executives said merchants didn’t meaningfully increase prices in the first quarter, but noted that could change depending on where tariff rates end up.

Title: If Trump Fires Powell, You’ll Want Own This 8.4% Dividend

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 02: (L to R) U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as his nominee for the ... More chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Fire Powell? Keep him around? The question never seems to go away—and the markets, fueled by the so-called “TACO” trade (“Trump always chickens out,” as the acronym goes), are shrugging it all off. But what if Trump calls Wall Street’s bluff? Luckily, there are not one but three ways for us to hedge ourselves from the “TACO trade” going cold. Below, we’ll look at all three and I’ll name my favorite of this trio. Plus we’ll grab ourselves tidy dividends of 7%+, too. If you’re experiencing déjà vu, it’s because this same story happened back in April, and it sent stocks plunging back then. This latest time, however, it’s had little impact at all. But why would stocks sell off based on Powell’s firing in the first place? It’s because of the Federal Reserve’s independence. Its operation of the country’s banking and financial system without intervention from the executive branch has been a mainstay since the central bank’s creation a century ago. And Wall Street wants things to stay that way. So, can we march forward into the future without worrying that Powell will be replaced and a new Fed chair will be inserted who bows to political pressure? This, after all, could increase the odds that interest rates will be cut too much—as low rates are popular—potentially goosing inflation in the process. In the long term, yes—the chances of a “new normal,” where the Fed just does what the president says, are basically zero. But in the short term, a selloff driven by this risk is a distinct possibility. That’s because, over the last few weeks, markets have become increasingly complacent, and stocks have gone from volatile to solidly positive. As I write this, the S&P 500 is up 7.8% for 2025, which is about where it should be, in my view. And I expect it to end 2025 higher still. But the VIX, the market’s “fear gauge,” soared in April, slowly fell back down, and is now a bit lower than where it started the year. In other words, the markets are now saying that stocks are less risky than they were at the start of 2025—even after all the talk about tariffs firing Powell, neither of which have fully gone away. Why? Because now the markets are banking on the TACO trade: If Trump keeps “chickening out,” as the acronym goes, he can be easily ignored. However, this is, paradoxically, a risk. Whatever your politics, it’s undeniable that Trump follows the equity markets and responds to them. Stocks recovered only after Trump backed off on the tariffs in April, which he did only after stocks fell. Stock market performance clearly matters a lot to Trump. As a result, we’re in a weird situation where a continued stock rally could encourage Trump to reverse moves that caused the market to tumble in the past. That would likely cause another drop, which could then prompt Trump to reverse course. As of now, stocks are simply jumping to the last step, rising on the assumption Trump will always back off. Which, ironically, gives him exactly the room he needs to do things that will cause stocks to fall, like firing Powell, for example. It’s all a bit exhausting! But this is where those funds I mentioned earlier come in. Right now, volatility itself is low, and that means any kind of “insurance” on the market hitting another storm is cheaper than normal. The “insurance” I want to tell you about today comes in the form of closed-end funds (CEFs) that buy or sell options on the stocks they hold. Under this strategy, these funds charge a fee, called a “premium,” to option traders for the right to buy the stocks in their portfolios at a fixed date and price in the future. They then use the premiums they collect to fund their dividends, which, as we’ll see shortly, are well north of 7%. This strategy works best in volatile markets—which means today’s lower volatility has put many of our favorite covered-call funds on sale. The three “go-to” covered-call CEFs out there are the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), which, as the name says, holds the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average; the S&P 500–focused Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX); and the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Between them, they provide broad exposure to the biggest companies in America, like Visa (V), Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). In other words, many of the same names you’d get if you bought an index fund. But with this trio, we’re getting much higher yields than any index fund pays. And second, unlike ETFs, CEFs (including these three) can trade at a “discount to NAV,” or net asset value. That’s another way of saying we can buy shares of their portfolios for less than they’re actually worth. Covered Call CEFs QQQX tends to be my favorite of these because it often yields the most and has the highest discount. But right now, it yields essentially the same as DIAX, while DIAX offers a much wider discount. That makes DIAX the best buy of the lot today. SPXX, with its 7.5% yield, isn’t generous enough with its dividend, and its discount of 1.3% is almost nonexistent. So if you want to stay in stocks (or stock-focused funds—which we do!) and hedge for future volatility, DIAX is the way to go. Consider also this chart. DIAX Lags On a NAV basis (or going by the performance of its underlying portfolio), DIAX (in purple above) was pretty closely matching its underlying Dow Jones Industrial Average index (in orange) until late April, when a sudden drop in volatility caused DIAX’s portfolio to underperform, and its underperformance has widened since. That’s an opportunity for a contrarian pickup, especially given the fund’s unusually large discount. DIAX Discount to NAV Back in 2022, when volatility was peaking, DIAX saw a flurry of demand. But as stocks have recovered, more money has flowed to alternatives, setting this fund’s discount roughly between 11% and 13%, where it’s been for over a year now. That’s unusual for DIAX, whose average discount has been 6.7% over the last decade. That makes DIAX a timely contrarian play on a rise in volatility, since its covered-call strategy makes it rise as markets get more skittish—and investors look for more “insurance” from the next big plunge.

Full Content:
Intel (INTC) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating a sizable move from the struggling chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Intel's stock could move more than 7% from its recent level near $23 by the end Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares above $24 at the upper end, their highest level since March, or drag them down to $21 at the lower end, about where they were a month ago. Intel's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 11% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. In April, shares fell 7% the day after earnings as the chipmaker issued a quarterly forecast below analysts’ expectations. Heading into Thursday's report, all 11 brokers covering Intel tracked by Visible Alpha have a neutral rating for the stock, with an average price target near $23. Analysts on average expect Intel’s quarterly revenue and profits to have declined year-over-year, with attention squarely on how new CEO Lip-Bu Tan will manage—or sell off—the chipmaker’s struggling foundry business. Tan is reportedly considering changing what manufacturing process the foundry business focuses on, a move that would cost the company hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, but could help win major customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Intel's stock had added about 13% in 2025 so far, but has still lost more than one-quarter of its value from this time last year.
