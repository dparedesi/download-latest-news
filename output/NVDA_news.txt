Micron Technology's (MU) stock has had a strong run in 2025 so far, and some Wall Street bulls say it's set to move. higher, as AI-driven orders grow. The memory chip maker's shares were up about 3% to around $193 in recent trading, extending their recent rally and putting them on track to top Friday's closing record. The stock has added more than half its value since the year began, making it one of the S&P 500's top performers for 2025. Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from a neutral rating on Monday, and lifted their price target to $220 from $160, a bit above the $196 average target compiled by Visible Alpha, pointing to booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory to support AI. "Conviction from our purchasing contacts is very high," the analysts said, adding "we see more room to run." Many of the S&P 500's top performers this year are companies that make data storage or memory products needed to support AI data centers, like Micron, and stand to benefit from the same tailwinds. Micron, which counts leading AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) among its partners, last month posted record quarterly sales, thanks in large part to growth from its data center business. AMD announced a massive deal on Monday with OpenAI that sent its stock soaring nearly 30% in recent trading. The news also helped lift shares of partner stocks like Micron and Astera Labs (ALAB), which saw its stock jump 11%.

Title: Novice Investor’s Digest For Monday, October 6: Stock Prices Stay Strong On AI Enthusiasm

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stock prices remained strong Friday on AI optimism and the expectation of lower interest rates later this year. The large-cap S&P 500 index rose slightly to close at a record high, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite pulled back 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, rose 0.5%, also hitting a new high. The U.S. government shutdown has not soured the stock market, even though the closure delayed an important jobs report due Friday. Other data due this week will likely be delayed also. Enthusiasm for AI’s future is commanding more attention than U.S. political leaders’ inability to compromise. In the last two weeks, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL ) announced leadership changes to facilitate AI growth, OpenAI was valued at $500 billion, Hitachi partnered with OpenAI on a data center buildout and Fujitsu teamed with Nvidia (NVDA) to build AI robots. The AI frenzy still has legs, and it’s driving decisions at the world’s largest companies. Amid the deal-making, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos shared his characterization of the environment—that while AI has real benefits, the technology is in “an industrial bubble” where good and bad ideas are getting funded. Bezos was speaking at Italian Tech Week. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones have gained 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.6%. Economic data coming from the federal government will be delayed due to the shutdown. Alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ) will report earnings after the market closes. Analysts expect STZ to report $3.41 EPS for the August quarter. The company’s EPS in the prior-year quarter was $4.32. Constellation Brands has fallen short of EPS expectations in two of the last three quarters. How does inflation affect your investments? The U.S. central bank, called the Fed, targets 2% inflation as the optimal rate for a healthy, growing economy. Inflation above 2% can create uncertainty, reduce consumer spending, put pressure on household and business budgets and shrink profits. Typically, the Fed addresses high inflation by raising interest rates, which can prompt more of the same: rising costs, lower spending and smaller profits. For these reasons, stock prices often grow more slowly or decline during periods of high inflation. But some companies fare better than others. Companies selling commodities or essential goods can do well in inflationary times. Commodities like oil, gas, precious metals and agricultural products become more valuable and can command higher prices under inflationary pressures. Essential goods have consistent demand—people keep buy toilet paper and toothpaste as prices rise. Essential goods with strong brand loyalty, like Charmin, do especially well, because their customers are less likely to switch to generic brands to save money. The other inflation consequence to consider is the drag on the value of your investment returns. Say your investments grow 10% at a time when inflation is 4%. You gained on the investments but lost on the inflation. Your net return can be approximated as 6%, or 10% less 4%. In investing lingo, the 10% is your nominal return and the 6% is your real return. Note that there is a more complicated real return formula that accounts for compounding, but the simple formula is adequate for estimates. Inflation can force a negative real return on assets that have appreciated or earned income. This is common for cash deposits and low-rate bonds. You could earn 1% in a traditional savings account while inflation is 2.9%, for example. In this scenario, the approximate net return is negative 1.9%. There are other benefits to holding cash, so investors commonly accept the potential for negative returns. The usual strategy is to offset negative cash returns by diversifying into higher-performing categories like stocks. Over the long-term, stocks outperform inflation.

Title: Major challenge to Nvidia: OpenAI’s massive new computing push will run on AMD chips | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI announced Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia (NVDA) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the breakthrough video generator Sora 2. Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a $100 billion partnership, in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD (AMD) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering. In addition to the AMD and Nvidia deals, OpenAI agreed last month to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for 4.5 gigawatts of data center space. And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal with Broadcom to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

Title: This Promise Of 70% Dividends From These ETFs Is Totally Bogus

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. What if you could squeeze, say, a 70% dividend yield from a fast-growing AI stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Palantir (PLTR)? Sounds great, right? Instead of relying just on these stocks’ prices for your profits (since dividends are, frankly, the furthest thing from their CFOs’ minds), you get their returns as high-yielding dividends. That’s something a new breed of ETFs is promising. These funds, which are gaining in popularity, hold just one stock—usually a Palantir, Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA—and trade options on that one stock to deliver stated yields often way above 50%. Does it work? First, let me say that, as someone who has covered 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) for over a decade, I get the sentiment behind these funds. Big income streams can create financial independence—who wouldn’t want as big of a yield as possible? But there’s a line where a dividend goes from appealing to dangerous—and it’s well below the stated 70% distribution rate, as of this writing, on a single-stock ETF like, say, the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY). That’s because, what these funds’ massive yields give, their share prices can easily take away. Consider the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY), which aims to deliver that 70% income stream by holding C3.ai (AI), a developer of AI apps for business. As I write this, AIYY investors have seen a total return of nearly negative 50% since the start of the year. With nearly half of their capital now lost in 2025 (with dividends included), those holding AIYY must be wondering what went wrong. Let’s start with that dividend, because there’s a key thing to note here: Even though AIYY’s website says its distribution rate is 71%, it also tells us that the fund’s 30-day SEC yield is only 4.8%. This means the fund’s net investment income (which can only be calculated by a strict SEC-mandated formula and excludes options income, which can be unpredictable) is much lower than that 70%—which is the payout as a percentage of the fund’s assets. Moreover, AIYY’s distributions keep falling, down 63% in 2025. Let me clear—not all of YieldMax’s 57 ETFs are losing money this year. In fact, most are up. The best return goes to the YieldMax PLTR Option Income Strategy ETF (PLTY), with a stated 49.4% yield. This fund has returned 77.9% for 2025 and is up much more since its inception in late 2024. So, have we found the secret to financial independence here? After all, with this 49.4% income stream, it takes only about $203,000 in upfront investment to get a six-figure income stream! Except, well, there’s a lot of risk behind this seemingly impressive chart. As you probably guessed from the fund name, this ETF tracks Palantir, whose stock has surged as the company wins more government contracts. If you predicted PLTR’s surge, congratulations—that’s impressive. But an investor who knew to invest in PLTR should’ve just bought that stock instead, since PLTY (in purple below) has badly lagged it. This problem is endemic to single-stock ETFs: These funds try to “translate” growth stocks’ gains into big dividends, but in so doing expose us to the risks of a single stock, with less upside. Sure, the income is great when the stock is rising, but that income will shrink if the stock drops. That’s what happened to the 56.2%-yielding YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY), which holds Moderna (MRNA) and is down 39% in 2025 and down even more since its IPO in early 2024. Anyone who bought MRNY and enjoyed the huge yields at the start of 2024 probably thought they were really on to something, as the fund’s total return rose into the spring. They then saw their fortunes reverse as the fund’s price fell. That’s the fate I expect for the aforementioned PLTY if the stock it tracks—again, Palantir—drops. And I see that as likely, since Palantir’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a stratospheric 278 as I write this. So what are these funds for, then? To be honest, I’m not sure. As we’ve seen, investors are almost always better off just buying the underlying stocks. What’s more, some of these ETF issuers are venturing into even riskier territory, like the recently released “Bonk Income Blast ETF,” which doesn’t just invest in crypto, but also in “other crypto ETFs, including non-US crypto-ETFs,” according to its SEC filing. This means investors will wind up paying the fees for this ETF, as well as fees for the ETFs it owns. Plus they’re exposing themselves to the risks of the crypto market and the risks of foreign markets—including potentially lax regulation—too. There’s just no reason to take risks like those when you can get predictable, diversified dividends from CEFs. Sure, CEFs don’t offer the mind-blowing yields of YieldMax and its ilk. But we’ll happily take that “lower” payout—bearing in mind many CEFs yield more than 8%, if it lets us sleep peacefully at night. Moreover, we benefit from CEFs discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), which hold the potential for future upside. ETFs—single stock or no—never offer us a discount. I think you’ll agree that this is a far better deal than a 70%-yielder that’s dropped around 50% in less than a year.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Roaring Again. Can They Keep Climbing?

Last year's Magnificent 7 tech leaders are rolling again. That hasn't always been the case this year. As a group, the the large-cap technology companies—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—have lagged the broader market for most of 2025. That's led to questions about whether the grouping's reign is over or if its membership should change. Then came September's rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is now up nearly 20% year-to-date, ahead of the S&P 500's close to 15% gain; it more than doubled the benchmark index's performance in the third quarter. The question now: What next? The bullishness hasn't dried up. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said Thursday that growth stocks, particularly those with ties to AI, were supported in the third quarter by strong earnings, expectations of AI-driven growth, and easing interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive. Wall Street analysts largely expect those trends to continue. There's wariness about a bubble in AI; Even Jeff Bezos has suggested that it's in a kind of "industrial bubble" in which it can be difficult for investors to identify the future winners and losers from the field of would-be standouts. Bank of America analysts on Friday said that "every bubble in history popped by central bank tightening, and no central bank in the world has hiked rates in past 2 months." A recent survey of Investopedia readers suggested cooling optimism about the stock market, though they said they remain heavily invested in growth stocks even with valuations at high levels. The Magnificent 7’s resurgence comes on the back of a rebound by tech heavyweights like Tesla and Apple, which had spent most of the year in the red. Their influence within the S&P 500, meanwhile, illustrates the power the group of tech giants have on global markets. The recent performance of some Magnificent 7 stocks highlights the breadth of the enthusiasm. AI darling Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise steadily since April as sales of its chips boomed and trade policy headwinds eased, remains the biggest gainer of the year. But Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's advance in recent weeks after spending a large part of the year in negative territory. Gains for Tesla's stock, which added a third of its value in September, came as worries about CEO Elon Musk's political activities and slumping sales cooled, and bulls shifted their focus toward the electric vehicle maker's advances in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI. Alphabet climbed about 15% in September after a major legal win in which a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser. Apple rose close to 10% after signs of surprisingly strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 and inroads with the Trump administration. All this has many market watchers wondering when the party might end but unwilling to leave just yet. Pictet Asset Management Chief Strategist Luca Paolini on Friday noted the expectation of lower rates and strong corporate profits among reasons to "see upside in equities despite possible impacts of the US government shutdown." Pictet, he wrote, sees "upside in riskier asset classes in the short term." This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent market levels.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strengthening its alliance with Fujitsu to co-develop full-stack artificial intelligence infrastructure, a move aimed at accelerating enterprise adoption of AI across industries from healthcare to manufacturing and robotics. The collaboration centers on building industry-specific AI agents that continuously learn and adapt, forming what both companies describe as the foundation for the next phase of the AI industrial revolution. The effort will integrate Fujitsu’s Monaka Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) via NVLink Fusion, enabling more specialized systems than general-purpose architectures can provide. Also Read: Nvidia Becomes The $4.5 Trillion Giant Driving AI’s Biggest Deals “Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing where Japan is a global leader. To further support the expanding needs of AI infrastructure, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will expand this partnership in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum,” said Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita. “The AI industrial revolution has begun, and we must build the infrastructure to power it, in Japan and across the globe. Fujitsu is a true pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. Together, NVIDIA and Fujitsu are connecting and extending our ecosystems to forge a powerful partnership for the era of AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang added. Fujitsu framed the collaboration against a backdrop of rising demand for generative AI, where high costs and technical hurdles have kept adoption largely confined to major corporations. The company said the partnership is designed to address those barriers by creating scalable infrastructure that balances performance, security, and enterprise autonomy. The deal comes as Nvidia continues to ride surging demand for its GPUs, which underpin most of the world’s cutting-edge AI systems. The company’s stock has surged 41% year-to-date, far outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index’s 19% gain. Earlier this week, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its central role in the AI boom. Price Action: NVDA stock was trading higher by 0.55% to $189.92 premarket at last check Friday. Read Next: Photo by Evolf via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.
