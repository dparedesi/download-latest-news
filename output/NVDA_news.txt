More of their meeting at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on April 21, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 40% or more in the upcoming months? Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that’s like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don’t be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over. This contrarian view isn’t just gut instinct - it’s part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks. If you believe markets are rational and always priced right, consider this: the U.S. may be running a demand deficit far more dangerous than its trade deficit. Read: The Real U.S Trade Deficit Armageddon Let’s be real - Nvidia has a boom-bust pattern that’s hard to ignore. Every time the hype gets too hot - whether it’s crypto, gaming, or AI - Nvidia’s stock overshoots and pays for it later. What makes you think it will be different this time? Nvidia is a classic example of how you have to bear extreme volatility while chasing returns. We combine different categories of stocks to lower the volatility while maintaining exposure to the upside in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Google Parent Alphabet's Stock Climbs as AI-Fueled Search Growth Drives Revenue Beat

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts’ expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The tech titan reported revenue of $90.23 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $34.54 billion, or $2.81 per share, compared to $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier, also topping Wall Street’s estimates. Google Cloud revenue rose 28% to $12.3 billion, while Search & Other segment revenue grew 10% to $50.7 billion. Alphabet also raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to 21 cents, and announced an additional $70 billion in stock buybacks. Alphabet's Class A shares rose close to 5% in after-hours trading. The stock was down about 16% for 2025 through Thursday’s close. CEO Sundar Pichai said Search growth was driven by "engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" after launching in May 2024. On the company's earnings call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said the quarter "marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.” Alphabet reiterated its plans to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, most of which is expected to go toward building out the company's AI infrastructure. “We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization,” CFO Anat Ashkenazi said, adding that Alphabet ended the quarter with more Cloud demand than it had capacity. The investments in AI infrastructure, “should help us have a more resilient organization, irrespective of macroeconomic conditions," Ashkenazi said. Pichai also gave Nvidia (NVDA) a shoutout during Thursday's call, saying Alphabet’s relationship with the AI chipmaker “continues to be a key advantage for our customers.” Alphabet was the first cloud provider to offer certain Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, Pichai said, and will offer its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, which are expected in 2026.

Title: 5 Top Stocks To Buy Now For May 2025

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These picks diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services, and are ... More anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models. The market landscape in early May 2025 is characterized by uncertainty and fragmentation, driven by a volatile combination of geopolitical instability, shifting sector dynamics and policy unpredictability. Economic rifts have deepened in recent weeks, driven in part by an unclear tariff framework and a lack of cohesive economic direction from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. With inflation pressures unresolved and confidence in long-term policy planning waning, investors are navigating a fragile environment where resilience is just as important as opportunity. This article highlights five standout investment opportunities for the current market climate. The list features a balanced mix of growth-oriented innovators that have seen recent corrections, alongside dependable dividend-paying leaders with strong balance sheets and defensible business models. In an era marked by dislocation and doubt, each of these companies offers a compelling case built on financial durability, competitive edge and potential catalysts poised to reward patient investors. This selection process balances fundamentals, technicals and macro context. For growth stocks, we focused on industry leaders with strong business models that have pulled back on sentiment, rather than fundamentals, offering attractive long-term entry points. Defensive picks emphasize dividend strength, valuation discipline and resilience across cycles. Each name was vetted for cash flow, balance sheet health and near-term catalysts. The result: a portfolio built for both upside and protection in an uncertain 2025 market. Tesla has evolved from a pure electric vehicle manufacturer into a comprehensive company focused on sustainable energy and artificial intelligence. While its automotive division continues to produce the Models 3, Y, S and the recently launched Cybertruck, as well as the $28,000 Model 2, Tesla has diversified into energy generation and storage with its Solar Roof, Powerwall and utility-scale battery installations. The company's vertical integration spans battery production through the Gigafactories, autonomous driving capabilities via its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and an expanding services ecosystem. Tesla's AI initiatives have accelerated following the commercial launch of its Optimus humanoid robot and Dojo supercomputer applications. The company maintains production facilities across four continents, with its newest Gigafactory in Indonesia having broken ground in late 2024. Despite facing intensifying competition in the electric vehicle (EV) space, particularly from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers' electric offerings, Tesla maintains significant advantages in manufacturing efficiency, battery technology and software capabilities. CEO Elon Musk's recent reorganizational efforts have focused on streamlining operations and accelerating the company's artificial intelligence and robotics divisions while maintaining automotive innovation. The decline follows multiple headwinds: lower-than-expected Q1 deliveries, intensifying global EV price competition, and delays in the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service. Compounding these challenges is growing investor unease over Elon Musk’s political behavior and public promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which many view as symbolic of his broader attempts to undermine government institutions. This has alienated a significant segment of the political left, including many upper-middle-class Democrats (Tesla’s core market), who increasingly distrust Musk and his leadership team. His involvement in multiple non-core ventures, including X (formerly Twitter) and other business interests, has further fueled concerns about diminished focus during a pivotal period for Tesla’s operational performance. Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report, released April 22, underscored these concerns. The company missed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion. Total revenue declined 9%, and net income dropped 71% from the prior year. Tesla cited factory upgrades, lower average selling prices, and incentives as key drags. The company also refrained from reaffirming its 2025 growth guidance, instead postponing updates until Q2. Despite this, shares saw a slight after-hours rebound following President Trump’s reassurance on Fed leadership—a sign of the stock’s continued political sensitivity. Yet not all is bleak. Tesla’s energy storage segment grew 67% year-over-year, and the company confirmed it remains on track to pilot both its robotaxi service in Austin and humanoid robot production in Fremont later this year. Meanwhile, the launch of its affordable Model 2 and the ongoing expansion of AI and Dojo infrastructure offer long-term upside. With $26.3 billion in cash and around $13 billion in debt, Tesla maintains the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges. For investors with a long horizon, the recent selloff may offer an entry point—albeit one that now demands careful monitoring of political, regulatory, and operational risks. NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming graphics card company into the world's leading provider of computing platforms for artificial intelligence and accelerated computing applications. The company's GPU technology has become the foundation of the AI revolution, with its data center segment now representing over 65% of total revenue. NVIDIA's hardware offerings span the entire computing spectrum, from GeForce gaming GPUs and workstation-class Quadro cards to data center-focused Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The company has expanded its reach beyond hardware through CUDA, its parallel computing platform, and an evolving software ecosystem that encompasses AI frameworks, digital twin simulations and enterprise solutions. In recent quarters, NVIDIA has accelerated its system integration efforts, introducing pre-configured AI systems, such as the DGX SuperPOD, as well as specialized solutions for various industries, including healthcare and telecommunications. The company's collaboration with leading cloud service providers has expanded, with specialized instances featuring NVIDIA's latest GPU architectures available across all major platforms. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's automotive computing platform continues gaining traction with automakers pursuing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving capabilities, creating another growth vector beyond its core markets. NVIDIA has pulled back more than 30% from its highs, but strong fundamentals and expanding markets make the dip a compelling opportunity. In its latest report, revenue surged 122% YoY with rising margins, countering fears of AI saturation or chip oversupply. With its next-gen Blackwell architecture launching in Q2 2025, NVIDIA is set to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure. Its edge lies in both cutting-edge hardware and a dominant software ecosystem that locks in customers and pricing power. Despite export-related headwinds, its strategic role in U.S. tech leadership remains intact. With projected earnings growth of over 40% through 2027 and rising shareholder returns, NVIDIA continues to offer a rare opportunity for long-term upside. Johnson & Johnson remains a global healthcare leader following its strategic transformation through the Kenvue consumer health spinoff, completed in 2023. The streamlined company now focuses exclusively on its pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which together represent cutting-edge healthcare innovation and stable, recession-resistant revenue streams. J&J's pharmaceutical division boasts a robust portfolio of treatments across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and cardiovascular health, including blockbuster drugs such as Stelara, Darzalex and Tremfya. Its medical device segment provides essential surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, vision care products and interventional solutions. The company's research and development capabilities remain industry-leading, with an annual R&D investment exceeding $15 billion and a pipeline featuring over 100 clinical development programs. J&J's acquisition strategy has been disciplined yet opportunistic, with recent purchases strengthening its capabilities in robotic surgery, cardiovascular devices and cell therapy platforms. Following the resolution of major talc litigation through its controversial Texas Two-Step bankruptcy strategy in late 2024, the company has reduced a significant overhang that had suppressed shareholder value for years. Johnson & Johnson blends defensive stability with meaningful growth potential—ideal for today’s uncertain market. Backed by 63 straight years of dividend increases and a 3.2% yield, JNJ generates strong cash flow and trades at a modest 14.8x forward earnings. Growth drivers include a robust pharmaceutical pipeline (targeting $15B in new revenue by 2028), expansion in oncology and cell therapy, and a rebound in elective procedures. Its Ottava robotic surgery platform just gained FDA approval. With $19 billion in net cash, JNJ has the flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or further dividend hikes, making it a rare combination of resilience and upside. Procter & Gamble maintains its position as the world's premier consumer packaged goods company, with an unparalleled portfolio of essential household brands across categories including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric care, home care and baby care. The company's flagship brands—including Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Charmin and Dawn—hold leading market positions in their respective segments across more than 180 countries. The company's operational excellence initiative, launched in 2023, has generated approximately $2.1 billion in annual cost savings through the implementation of manufacturing automation, supply chain optimization and digital transformation. These efficiencies have enabled P&G to navigate inflationary pressures while continuing to invest in product innovation and marketing effectiveness. Procter & Gamble is a strong defensive play for 2025, backed by essential products, pricing power and a history of consistent performance. With 5.2% organic sales growth, 33% of sales from emerging markets, and 18% from e-commerce, P&G continues to expand through premiumization and innovation. Financially, it’s disciplined, with 68 consecutive years of dividend increases and steady buybacks. Recent gains in the fabric care, health, and home categories demonstrate resilience in the face of intense competition. For investors seeking stability, income, and moderate growth, P&G remains a reliable cornerstone. Waste Management is North America's largest environmental services provider, serving over 21 million customers across municipal, commercial and residential sectors. Its vast network — spanning over 500 collection sites, 260 landfills and 140 recycling facilities—creates high barriers to entry and drives efficiency through vertical integration and dense routing. The company has strategically expanded its sustainability initiatives, positioning itself as both a waste collector and a materials management company, with a focus on extracting maximum value from waste streams. WM's recycling operations process nearly 12 million tons of materials annually, while its renewable energy projects generate enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. The company's recent strategic acquisitions, including the $4.6 billion purchase of Stericycle, completed in January 2025, have strengthened its position in specialized, higher-margin waste streams such as medical, hazardous and industrial waste, complementing its core municipal solid waste business. Waste Management offers a rare blend of recession-resistant stability and growth potential. With ~70% of revenue from long-term contracts tied to inflation, WM enjoys steady cash flow and strong pricing power. Operational efficiency gains have expanded EBITDA margins by 180 bps since 2023, providing downside protection. But WM isn’t just defensive—it’s growing. Renewable natural gas projects, the Stericycle acquisition and improved recycling margins are driving revenue and diversification. With rising free cash flow, a 10% dividend increase in Q1 2025 and ongoing buybacks, WM delivers income, growth and environmental impact, setting it apart from traditional utilities. Bottom Line The five highlighted stocks—Tesla, NVIDIA, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Waste Management—offer a balanced approach for navigating the market challenges of May 2025. Tesla and NVIDIA offer growth potential following sharp pullbacks, while J&J, P&G and Waste Management provide defensive stability and income. Together, they diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services—anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models.

Full Content:
One of Wall Street's Apple bulls pared their optimism on the tech giant's shares today. Bank of America analysts on Thursday maintained their "buy" rating on Apple (AAPL) stock, but they also trimmed their price target by $10, lowering it to $240. (That's still above the Street's mean near $234, according to Visible Alpha.) Their reasons: tariff-related costs that could weigh on margins, along with concerns that delayed AI features could dent device demand. The stock, meanwhile, was ticking higher as broader markets rose. Apple's shares were recently up 0.6% to above $205. Apple is set to join the parade of Magnificent Seven tech companies to report earnings, with its next set of results due next Thursday after the closing bell. Bank of America expects some tariff-driven "pull forward" to have helped lift sales during the most recent quarter, but they're cutting longer-term sales estimates "to adjust for higher costs of navigating a more complex supply chain and for delays in launching an AI enabled Siri." Apple's shares are down about 18% so far this year, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Research firm Vanda earlier this week noted recent net selling of Apple by retail investors even as net buying continued elsewhere—such as shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). "Individuals continue to give off capitulation-lite signals, but a full-blown unwind remains moderately far on the horizon," Vanda wrote in a Wednesday note.

Chip stocks were among the market leaders on Wednesday thanks to President Donald Trump’s statement the day before that tariffs on China “will come down substantially,” as well as vote of confidence by famed investor Cathie Wood. Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought up stock in several chipmakers on Tuesday, including $1.1 million shares of Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday, Nvidia jumped more than 5%, approaching its 21-day moving average. Palintir Technologies (PLTR) also had a strong performance Wednesday, rising more than 7%, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shot up by 10.2% during the day, AMD (AMD) rose 8.1%, Micron (MU) jumped 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO) more than 7%. Although semiconductors and other electronics are currently exempt from steep U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, administration officials have said those exemptions are temporary, and tariffs would probably be imposed on the sector in a month or two. Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

Title: Nvidia investors should watch out for this key risk that could trigger a double-digit semiconductor stock plunge in the next 12 months

It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year. If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan. In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%. While most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released. "President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing," Papic and Gertken wrote. "That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade." Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy. Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers," Yardeni wrote in a note last week. "President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy." BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months. Taiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies. In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed "WWIII," expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. "Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification," Papic and Gertken wrote. In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500. Investors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe. "Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event," wrote Papic and Gertken. "For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices." As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said. "Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap," they wrote. Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU). Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

As Tesla (TSLA) prepares to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings after the bell Tuesday, investors are watching closely for updates on two long-delayed projects: the company’s affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi platform. The two initiatives once were expected to define Tesla’s next chapter — but concerns about CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements are clouding the outlook. Analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk’s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand. Tesla’s stock has plunged 40% year-to-date, impacted by falling deliveries, fierce competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD (BYDDY), and political headwinds. But there’s one group of investors that’s thriving: short sellers. According to S3 Partners, traders betting against Tesla have made an estimated $11.5 billion in profits so far this year — making it the most profitable short globally, surpassing Nvidia (NVDA). Short interest has climbed 15% as bearish sentiment builds. Public perception is also shifting. A recent CNBC (CMCSA) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand’s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce. But with investor nerves fraying, Tesla’s Q1 report could be a decisive moment in the company’s 2025 story — for bulls and bears alike.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/22/2025 7:51:17 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Now that Pat Gelsinger is no longer occupying the corner office at embattled chipmaker Intel (INTC), he can acknowledge one thing about the semiconductor industry.Nvidia (NVDA) has a wide, wide lead over its rivals on the tech front..."They have built meaningful moats around their franchise," he added.Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around Intel for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).He was fired in early December amid missed financial targets, lack of progress on the AI chip front, and a cash drain on the foundry business.Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.Analysts think Nvidia may post upward of $5 per share in earnings in 2025. Nvidia's stock is up 1,220% over the past five years, while Intel's has dropped 69%.Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO in March.Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with Gelsinger over how to position the business.Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel...Tan will get to outline his strategy publicly -- and detail how he will navigate Trump tariffs -- when the company announces first quarter results on April 24 after the market close.

Intel Agencies Caught in Massive Voter Fraud USAWatchdog.com ^ | 4FEB2025 | Greg Hunter Posted on 2/5/2025, 10:19:32 AM by Tom Tetroxide Dr. Jerome Corsi has a Harvard PhD in political science. He has written more than 30 books with many of them becoming best-sellers. Dr. Corsi’s latest project is about voter fraud. Corsi says he can prove Donald Trump really did win in 2020. There were also countless down-ballot thefts in 2020 and in 2024. Dr. Corsi and others have uncovered a grand scam that dates back to the early 2000’s that has cheated people into office that actually lost. The architects of the steal can be traced back to U.S. intel agencies. Dr. Corsi created a website for this project called GodsFiveStones.com and explains, “GodsFiveStones.com is named after the David and Goliath Bible story. This is when David picks up five smooth stones from the brook, and they are the exact ones needed to kill Goliath. That’s what we are aiming to do is to kill this Goliath of voter fraud.” The voter fraud is hidden in the voter rolls that every state government maintains. Corsi says, “You look at state records, and there might be 12 million records and there might be 2 million false records. They look legitimate until you really analyze them, and then you realize they are duplicates or clones. If you send out people to canvas them, there is nobody there. They are falsified and hidden in the data base. It’s like a card marking scheme. . . . They did not use the algorithms in the 2024 Election for President because we were on the lookout for it. The down-ballot elections (House, Governor and Senate) used these algorithms, and they cheated.” Corsi estimates they cheated 20 House Democrats and 5 Democrat Senators into office in 2024. snip I recommend “The nVidia Way” book. It’s an interesting read, much of the success is around their culture. Jensen just outworks everyone, requiring it of everyone. They behave as though the next breakthrough in tech will kill the company, so be first and never get complacent. That said, it seems he sacrifices his life to just work. I was in a company bought by Intel. They were constantly distracted by different ideas. They seemed to have no focus. They also didn’t listen, there was a certain arrogance about the Intel employees. They’re way behind in AI hardware and software. It’s not just the hardware. The CUDA software opened doors into unanticipated markets. That said, from a stock point of view, imho...they’re going to enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ on the Gartner Hype Cycle. The possibilities hit regulatory aspects. The recent market performance may be reflecting this but it’s hard to see due to the other volatility (e.g. tariffs). Long term buy, looking for another dip - over 30% down since start of the year. I used to work for Intel, but I was in and out before Pat came to power. But a good friend who worked there for a LONG time used to work for Pat and says that he’s a very smart engineer, and he thought the right person for the job as CEO. When things didn’t go so well under his leadership my friend said he believed the issue was that Pat was an engineer, and that the board of directors (who make all the decisions ANYWAY), didn’t WANT an engineer to lead the company, they wanted more of a finance guy. So here we are. A different world but when I was supporting government development projects the two big leaders would be Program Manager (focusing on Cost and Schedule) and Chief Engineer (focusing on technical requirements). I never worked with a Chief Engineer who gave a fig about technical requirements. The Chief Engineers always focused on Cost and Schedule. Always the money. Never the engineering. I know a bunch of former Intel people who now work at AMD they say Intel is in a death spiral and while AMD needs to spend and upgrade their Server lab spaces they are poised to kick some Intel ass. The only thing the new CEO brings is customer feedback on fabless design needs. True something very missing from Intel but it might not be enough. DEI has destroyed the inner workings of Intel started by Obama. It has not been the same place since Paul Otellini retired. Intel had a long track record of forcing out experienced people and replacing them with Indian workers. Those experienced engineers went to AMD, Nvidia, Apple and IBM. I went to IBM where for the first time after 30 years, felt like I was being treated like a professional. You were just a number at Intel.
