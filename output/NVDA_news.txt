Title: Watch These Alphabet Stock Price Levels After Google Parent Joins the $3 Trillion Club

Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year. Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for. Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month. While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking. It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring. Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value. When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201). Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201). The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Title: AI’s Next Dividend Bonanza Is NOT Where You Think

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. While Wall Street chases NVIDIA (NVDA), the real AI dividend story is unfolding in the sleepy insurance sector. These “boring” firms are quietly leveraging AI tools to slash costs, grow premiums, and—best of all—dish us bigger dividends. AI is spreading across the economy much faster than many expected. That means we need to move even faster to front-run that shift. We’ve already been hard at it. In July, we talked about our favorite dividend payer to grab as AI reworks farming. Few people realize it, but “ag” has a long history of leveraging tech. It’s a big reason why productivity per farm worker has shot up 16X since 1948. Then there’s small business—and our favorite 8.8%-paying business development company (BDC), which funds many of these “mom-and-pop” shops. You don’t hear much about it, but small biz is wildly optimistic as AI helps it solve one of its toughest challenges: finding skilled workers. So where to next? When most people think about AI in business, they think about annoying customer-service chatbots. But that’s just the public side, and only a small part of the story. The real AI “juice”—especially for insurers—is on the back end. Picture an AI app pulling data from a patient’s medical records, zipping through the underwriting process and delivering a quote in seconds. While that’s going on, another runs compliance checks. Claims? Send in a picture of your damaged car/house/business and your payout pops into your account in minutes. Absolute gold for customer retention. All of this is happening in insurance right now. And that’s just on the efficiency side. The growth story is where things get interesting, as salespeople use AI to zero in on leads and cross-sell products. One example, cited in a July 2025 report from research firm McKinsey & Co., is that an AI app could assess a new life-insurance customer and toss out a personalized package, including disability and critical-illness coverage. As I said, initiatives like these are driving real returns for insurers today. And according to a January 2024 report from McKinsey, insurers that prioritize tech, including AI, have delivered far bigger total shareholder returns (TSR) than firms in other sectors. The best part of all for us is that the public still sees insurers as stuffy pencil-pushers (the same type of outdated view that hovers over agriculture). Let’s dive into three insurers leading the way in AI, and likely to hand their savings (and profit growth) to us in the form of dividend hikes. They all have appeal, but to make things simple, I’ve ranked them from “worst to first.” Progressive (PGR) was already a leader in algo-driven insurance before AI came along. Through fictional salesperson “Flo,” it could deliver a competitive insurance quote for a car, home or even a boat in a few minutes. Fast-forward to today and Flo is, you guessed it, a chatbot. Looking a bit deeper, the company is using AI to further refine Snapshot—its program that adapts rates based on real-time data from a customer’s car. It’s also using the tech to analyze photos of damage to speed up claims. Members of my Hidden Yields service will remember this one: We bagged an 87% return on it during our last holding period, from June 2019 to May 2023. PGR remains on my watch list, and we won’t hesitate to jump back into this savvy dividend payer (whose 0.16% yield masks the fact that it pays most of its dividend as a year-end special payout—often a big one). But with the stock trading around 4.4-times book value, that time is not now. We’d also like to see more buybacks: PGR’s share count is about where it was 10 years ago. The Travelers Cos. (TRV) is a giant in insurance, offering everything from property to personal and business coverage. On the claims side, Travelers, like Progressive, uses AI to analyze images of property damage and speed payments to policyholders, often before a human ever sets foot on the site. That kind of speed gives TRV a much better shot at keeping customers happy—and hanging on to their business. On the growth side, the company has tools like Business Owner Policy 2.0, which speeds up underwriting, getting a quote into a new small business customer much faster than in “analog” days. According to the company, the process cuts the number of questions a potential new business client has to answer by 70%, from around 40 to roughly nine. Moves like these are rocket fuel for a business that’s already firing on all cylinders. In the second quarter, TRV saw its catastrophe losses drop from $1.5 billion a year ago to $927 million. Written premiums jumped 4% and net investment income jumped 6%. That last number is particularly impressive since an insurer’s “float”—made up of total premiums collected—has to be placed in safer investments. Management loves its shareholders, too: Over the last decade, Travelers bought back 26% of its shares and hiked its payout 80%. That’s driven the share price up a stout 170%. With reinvested dividends, that return jumps to 237%! The only drawback? We like to buy a stock when the share price lags its “Dividend Magnet”—a true sign of value—and that’s not the case here. That’s why we’re putting this “stealth” AI dividend play on our watch list, instead of our buy list. Meantime, the AI focus at American International Group (AIG) is solidly on underwriting. The company has teamed up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Anthropic to develop AI tools that supercharge its human underwriters. Through these deals, it aims to help its underwriters process 500,000 E&S submissions in 2030, generating at least $4 billion in new business premiums. (E&S covers risks that don’t fit neatly in the silos of other kinds of coverage.) To put that in context, AIG generates about $28 billion in revenue a year. AIG also plans to create a “digital twin,” kind of a virtual mock-up of itself management can use to see what various decisions could have on the business. It’s on the dividend front that AIG gets really interesting. It yields 2.3% today and, following a long, stale period stretching back to 2016, it has recently sprung back to life. Management hasn’t been leaving investors out in the cold, though—it’s been busy buying back its ultra-cheap stock. That includes a massive repurchase of 56% of its shares outstanding in the last decade. Better still, it’s been accelerating those payouts just as it’s reawakened its dividend: Normally we don’t like to see a company buy more of its stock as it’s rising, as is the case here. But AIG’s reasonable valuation of around book value is backed up by its share price, which still lags the dividend. An AI-powered efficiency boost would only add to the stock’s momentum.

Title: China Bans Top Tech Firms From Buying Nvidia Chips, Report Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/china-bans-top-tech-firms-from-buying-nvidia-chips-report-says-11811683

China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country. Shares of Nvidia, which entered Wednesday's session up roughly a third this year, fell about 3% in recent trading following the news. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D—the chip Nvidia introduced in July for the Chinese market, according to the Financial Times. Beijing had concluded that homegrown chips are now performing on par with the Nvidia chips allowed in China under export controls, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. The FT report said the companies that started testing and verification work on the chip with Nvidia's server suppliers have since told their suppliers to stop the work. The new ban is stronger than prior guidance from regulators that focused on curbing use of the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip, and comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Asked at a press conference in London about the reported ban, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was "disappointed." Huang is among U.S. tech executives accompanying President Donald Trump on a state visit to the U.K. "We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said, according to a transcript provided to Investopedia by the company. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese [government] and Chinese companies as they wish.” Nvidia faces U.S. export restrictions on sales of its most advanced chips to China and has tailor-made some of its semiconductors for the country's market. In August, Trump ended H20 restrictions his administration had placed earlier earlier in the year in exchange for a 15% share of revenues.

Stock futures are little changed as investors get ready for today’s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to lower rates for the first time this year; China has reportedly ordered firms to stop buying the latest Nvidia (NVDA) chip designed for that market; Meta Platforms (META) is expected to highlight its AI glasses at its developer event; and StubHub shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are little changed ahead of today’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit fresh all-time highs yesterday morning before finishing the day slightly lower, were down less than 0.1% this morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked lower to 4.01%, near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were down slightly at around $3,700 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin edged lower to $116,300. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates today, with the announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET today. While most investors believe the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, some are betting that a half-point cut is possible amid signs of weakness in the labor market. The Fed will also release its quarterly projections on the direction of the economy and interest rates. At 2:30 p.m. ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss the decision and speak on general economic conditions. Investors will be looking for signals that the Fed believes economic conditions warrant more rate cuts in the coming months. China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading. Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's "Hypernova" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday. StubHub has raised $800 million from its initial public offering after pricing the deal at the midpoint of a marketed range, as the online ticketing reseller succeeds in its third attempt at going public. StubHub sold 34 million shares for $23.50 each, which values the online ticket reseller at around $8.8 billion. The stock is expected to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “STUB”. The IPO comes after StubHub delayed its own listing plans earlier this year amid market turmoil following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. StubHub’s listing follows similar public offerings in recent weeks, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna’s IPO last week.

News Summary: NVIDIA today announced that it is accelerating the AI industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, working with partners including CoreWeave, Microsoft and Nscale to build the nation’s next generation of AI infrastructure. By the end of 2026, the companies will build and operate AI factories that will serve leading AI models, including those from OpenAI, to enable the U.K.’s sovereign AI goals for building a platform to power innovation, growth and opportunity across the economy. Unveiled three months after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced a collaboration at London Tech Week, this new infrastructure will foster new job opportunities and support strong, secure and sustainable economic growth across the U.K, as well as serve as a platform for groundbreaking research in priority areas agreed in the U.K.-U.S. tech partnership, including medicine and drug discovery. Unveiled in honor of transatlantic technology and trade partnership during U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to the U.K., the AI factories will scale up AI infrastructure in the U.K. with 120,000 NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs and up to £11 billion for local data centers — the largest rollout in the country’s history. Furthermore, NVIDIA is enabling U.K. cloud partner Nscale to scale up its global expansion with 300,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPUs worldwide. “The United Kingdom is building the infrastructure for the AI industrial revolution — advancing science, transforming industries and creating new economic opportunities,” said Huang. “We are at the big bang of intelligence, and the United Kingdom’s Goldilocks ecosystem of world-class expertise, outstanding universities and vibrant industries is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of AI. With AI supercomputers powering state-of-the-art models locally, a new generation of U.K. researchers, developers and entrepreneurs will drive discovery and build the companies of tomorrow.” “In this age of AI, I want the U.K. to be the destination of choice for companies at the forefront of technological change, and renowned for harnessing homegrown talent and building sovereign capability,” said Starmer. “These major announcements mark a decisive step towards the U.K. becoming a world leader in AI, meaning more jobs and investment, more money in people’s pockets and transformed public services — all part of our Plan for Change.” Sovereign AI Infrastructure Expands to Accelerate U.K. Development and Deployments Several new AI factories are being built by NVIDIA partners to transform the nation’s economy and unlock opportunities with AI. NVIDIA Cloud Partner Nscale, the U.K.-based AI infrastructure company, is deploying 300,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPUs in AI factories across the United States, Portugal and Norway, with 60,000 NVIDIA GPUs now being established in the U.K. Nscale, OpenAI and NVIDIA are establishing Stargate U.K., which will feature NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs operating in Nscale’s U.K. data centers by 2026, bringing the most advanced U.S. technology to transform the nation’s economy and unlock opportunities with AI. OpenAI is expected to use this NVIDIA infrastructure to serve its models — including its latest and most advanced reasoning model, GPT-5. “Sovereign AI infrastructure is key to national resilience, economic growth and strategic autonomy,” said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. “This milestone deepens our commitment to providing critical AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.” “The U.K. has been a longstanding pioneer of AI and is now home to world-class researchers, millions of ChatGPT users and a government that quickly recognized the potential of this technology,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. “Stargate U.K. builds on this foundation to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, improve productivity and drive economic growth. This partnership reflects our shared vision that with the right infrastructure in place, AI can expand opportunity for people and businesses across the U.K.” Nscale and Microsoft also announced plans to build the U.K.’s most powerful supercomputer in Loughton. It is expected to feature more than 24,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Ultra GPUs to provide Microsoft Azure services in the U.K. "We are focused on ensuring that both the U.S. and the U.K. remain at the forefront of AI and cloud innovation," said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. “That is why we are partnering with NVIDIA to bring together our global platform with their latest compute, software and network capabilities so innovators across the country have the most powerful tools to shape the future with AI.” Additionally, CoreWeave today announced that it will establish an advanced data center in Scotland with Grace Blackwell Ultra GPUs, powered by renewable energy. “AI innovation and adoption is critical to national competitiveness, and CoreWeave is committed to delivering the infrastructure that makes it possible,” said Michael Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave. “This latest phase of CoreWeave investment in the U.K. will bring more advanced infrastructure to data centers across England and Scotland, giving researchers and businesses direct access to cutting-edge resources that strengthen the U.K.’s position in a fast-moving global technology landscape.” In addition, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently announced it will invest up to £500 million to modernize U.K. data centers in partnership with Digital Gravity Partners. These data centers will be refurbished to be NVIDIA-ready, enabling them to be equipped with the latest AI hardware to build the infrastructure for the AI industrial revolution — advancing science, transforming industries and creating new economic opportunities in the U.K. NVIDIA Accelerates the U.K. Quantum Ecosystem NVIDIA is also collaborating with U.K. quantum computing pioneers to accelerate technology development across quantum applications, error correction, infrastructure and AI integration. OQC and Digital Realty are establishing a quantum-AI center, working with NVIDIA to deliver the AI supercomputing that will support quantum processors.

September 16, 2025 17:33 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LONDON, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced that it is investing in accelerating the AI industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, working with partners including CoreWeave, Microsoft and Nscale to build the nation’s next generation of AI infrastructure. By the end of 2026, the companies will build and operate AI factories that will serve leading AI models, including those from OpenAI, to enable the U.K.’s sovereign AI goals for building a platform to power innovation, growth and opportunity across the economy. Unveiled three months after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced a collaboration at London Tech Week, this new infrastructure will foster new job opportunities and support strong, secure and sustainable economic growth across the U.K, as well as serve as a platform for groundbreaking research in priority areas agreed in the U.K.-U.S. tech partnership, including medicine and drug discovery. Unveiled in honor of transatlantic technology and trade partnership during U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to the U.K., the AI factories will add an up to £11 billion investment in the U.K. with 120,000 NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs to local data centers — the largest rollout in the country’s history. Furthermore, NVIDIA is enabling U.K. cloud partner Nscale to scale up its global expansion with 300,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPUs worldwide. “The United Kingdom is building the infrastructure for the AI industrial revolution — advancing science, transforming industries and creating new economic opportunities,” said Huang. “We are at the big bang of intelligence, and the United Kingdom’s Goldilocks ecosystem of world-class expertise, outstanding universities and vibrant industries is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of AI. With AI supercomputers powering state-of-the-art models locally, a new generation of U.K. researchers, developers and entrepreneurs will drive discovery and build the companies of tomorrow.” “In this age of AI, I want the U.K. to be the destination of choice for companies at the forefront of technological change, and renowned for harnessing homegrown talent and building sovereign capability,” said Starmer. “These major announcements mark a decisive step towards the U.K. becoming a world leader in AI, meaning more jobs and investment, more money in people’s pockets and transformed public services — all part of our Plan for Change.” Sovereign AI Infrastructure Expands to Accelerate U.K. Development and DeploymentsSeveral new AI factories are being built by NVIDIA partners to transform the nation’s economy and unlock opportunities with AI.

US stock market experienced a modest pullback on Tuesday as investors balanced optimism from strong consumer spending against uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated policy meeting. Despite the slight declines in major indexes, economic data revealed robust retail sales in August, rising 0.6%, well above expectations. This indicates that American consumers remain resilient even as inflation persists and the labor market shows signs of softening.

Title: 3 High Yield Dividends To Buy As Stocks Hit All-Time Highs

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We’ve got a frankly, bizarre dynamic setting up in stocks right now. Global stocks are clobbering their American cousins this year. But here’s the disconnect: This is happening even though US stocks are hitting all-time highs seemingly every day. On the surface, it sounds like both of these can’t be true. But as we’ll see below, this setup makes total sense. We’ll also look at how we can play it for both offense—price upside, in other words—and defense (in the form of 8%+ dividends), too. Here we’re looking at the S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), in purple, compared to the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Index Fund (VEU), a good benchmark for global stocks (minus the US, as the name says), in orange. So what’s going on here? It’s only when we zoom out that things clear up: Over the long run, America’s lead is unquestionable—and it puts this year’s “blip” in much better context. This is why, if you subscribe to my CEF Insider service, you know I remain bullish on US stocks, particularly the high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold them. That’s because at CEF Insider we focus on dividends (often in the 8%+ range) and we think long-term. And while US stocks might trail for short periods, betting against America over the long term is always a mistake. But I do understand that more Americans are interested in buying international stocks. We can see that in the run they’ve put on this year: It quite simply wouldn’t have happened without Americans climbing aboard the global bandwagon. (America does, after all, have the highest percentage of stock investors in the world, at 55% of the population, going by the latest numbers from Visual Capitalist.) And holding at least some international stocks is just plain smart, especially if we see another April-style pullback in US markets. Beyond that, many international stocks pay higher dividends than US firms. Even looking across the northern border nets a considerably higher dividend yield, with index funds tracking major Canadian stocks yielding 2.6%, more than double the S&P 500’s 1.2%. But that’s still just 2.6%! Not nearly enough to fund a retirement on. VEU pays roughly the same. Then there’s VEU’s long-term underperformance, which I talked about a second ago. The main problem with VEU is that it’s simply too diversified. With its passive approach to owning just about everything abroad, it holds a lot of questionable companies in questionable countries. This is why actively managed funds (like the three 8%+ payers we’ll discuss below) have outperformed it in many cases. For instance, Tencent Holdings is one of VEU’s biggest positions, and the Chinese government has warned stock prices have gotten too high in the mainland as of late. That’s raised the possibility of new rules to limit stock speculation, which would hurt large stocks like Tencent. That’s why we want active management—especially in international stocks. That way we ensure we’re avoiding not just poor-quality companies but also those that operate in less-stable nations, where the rule of law may not be as strong as it is in places like North America and Europe. The three CEFs we’re going to discuss next give us that. Plus they’ve all beaten VEU (in green in the chart below) over the long term. And they’ve done so during a time when foreign assets were less popular among US investors. That sets them up for stronger gains now that more Americans are thinking globally. Let’s dive into them. The Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) gives us stock-like upside with convertible bonds acting as “ballast.” I say that because convertibles provide high, steady income, even in volatile markets. The result is a dividend that shows up every month and yields 8.1% on an annualized basis. With CHW, we’re effectively buying cash flow and the option to pivot between income-producing bonds and stocks, with both on sale; its largest positions—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and a Boeing (BA) 6% convertible preferred bond—let us tap surging AI growth, while the convertible bond dampens pullbacks with its steadier price and payouts. And because the fund’s mandate spans the world, management can shift with volatility. This flexibility has also helped keep the fund’s dividend steady over the last three years. Next up is the LMP Capital & Income Fund (SCD), with its combination of income-producing assets and capital-gains-producing stocks. The fund pays monthly, at a 9.3% annualized rate. And it’s cheap, too, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). SCD’s biggest positions consist of both tech darlings and utilities, with names like Marvell Technology (MRVL), Oracle (ORCL) and PPL Corp. (PPL) pairing growth and reliability. The result is a steady, diversified cash machine that can lean toward offense or defense without putting the dividend at risk. Finally, let’s talk about a less-obvious investment I like because it combines American blue chips and top foreign firms. The Virtus NFJ Dividend Value Fund (NFJ) captures income from foreign demand while blending in US firms, with their reliable regulations. It also generates extra income using a covered-call strategy that generates more income when global tensions rise. NFJ owns dividend payers and convertibles, sells call options and hands us a 9.3% dividend while trading at a steep 9.5% discount. The fund also uses zero leverage—a nice extra margin of safety should interest rates unexpectedly rise. With a portfolio dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL), AMD (AMD) and Prologis (PLD), this fund combines American giants with large margins and reliable cash flows with exposure to foreign demand (about half of Alphabet’s revenue comes from abroad, and about a quarter for AMD). Now, I’ve been saving the best part, and it’s this chart. SCD’s discount (in orange above) recently exploded to a premium before fading to its 6.7% discount. CHW’s 10.8% discount (in purple) has broken through the 10% mark a few times lately, and NFJ’s 9.3% discount (in blue) has narrowed quite a bit. On the whole, this tells us that more investors are noticing these funds, setting up their discounts to shrink further, putting a lift under their share prices as they do.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Rolling Regressions in Clojure for Real-Time Alpha and Beta Monitoring
URL: https://clojurecivitas.github.io/finance/portfolio_analysis/alpha_beta_regression.html
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Edward Widjaja cim Tanvi Nagar cim Matthias Buehlmaier cim September 16, 2025 This blog post presents a functional, reproducible implementation of rolling regression in Clojure to estimate time-varying alpha(α) and beta(β) for student-managed portfolios at the Centre for Investment Management (CIM), The University of Hong Kong. Unlike traditional CAPM tests based on passive index data, our analysis uses actual(synthetic) trades executed by junior portfolio managers- undergraduate students who manage simulated equity portfolios over multiple semesters. We use hypothetical trade data from student portfolio managers at the Centre for Investment Management, including: ● Trade dates, tickers, shares, prices ● Portfolio valuations over time(monthly rebalancing) ● Cash flows and position weights ● Returns are computed at the portfolio level, aggregated monthly from individual holdings. ● Benchmark: S&P 500 total return index ● Excess returns are calculated for both portfolios and the market. ● The risk free rate is omitted from analysis for ease of understanding concepts since it does not affect the final results presented in this proposal For each student portfolio, we estimate the CAPM regression over a rolling 12- or 24-month window: Using ordinary least squares(OLS), we obtain a time series of: ● Alpha(α): time-varying abnormal return(skill or luck?) ● Beta(β): evolving sensitivity to market movements(risk awareness?) ● Windows slide forward monthly, producing a dynamic view of performance. The full analysis pipeline is implemented in Clojure, designed for clarity, reuse, and integration into teaching workflows. Below are some core libraries that were used in the project. ● generateme/fastmath: for OLS regression and statistical operations ● scicloj/tablecloth: for data preparation and transformation ● clj-python/libpython-clj: to fetch price data using the yfinance library in Python ● org.clojure/data.csv: for inputting securities for analysis ● org.clojure/clojure.data.json: to parse JSON strings The below function uses a simple Python script (with the help of clj-python to integrate Python with Clojure) to fetch open and closing prices for NVIDIA stocks and the S&P 500 Index from Yahoo Finance. We can then obtain data as follows: Using the scicloj/tablecloth library, we transform our data, obtaining the stock and market closing prices and their dates. We continue with creating functions to calculate arithmetic returns, and calculating the day-by-day returns for the stock and the market. Now, this is where we implement our rolling market model, where we regress NVDA stock returns on the market returns using a rolling window to obtain sets of alpha and beta. To achieve this, we utilize the generateme/fastmath library to implement our very own rolling window regression function. Finally, we use these functions to obtain our sets of alpha and beta. Note that the size of the window is 252 to represent the number of trading days in a year. We present time-series plots of alpha and beta for multiple student portfolios across two academic years. While stock prices reflect market consensus, alpha and beta decompose returns into risk-adjusted components, revealing whether performance was due to systematic market exposure(beta) or true outperformance(alpha). This provides deeper insight than price alone, enabling informed evaluation of risk, skill, and value creation. The above charts show the alpha over time for NVDA(Nvidia) and the historical alpha tracking can help inform future trades. A close-up analysis of alpha reveals some interesting observations, for example: ● The declining trend in NVIDIA’s(NVDA) alpha relative to the S&P 500, as observed from October 2023 to July 2025, reflects a significant shift in the stock’s market performance dynamics. ● Initially exhibiting strong positive alpha-indicative of substantial outperformance over the broader market-NVDA’s excess return diminished steadily over time, converging toward zero by mid-2025. ● This erosion of alpha can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the normalization of AI-driven valuation premiums, increased competitive pressures from semiconductor peers, and a broader market environment characterized by robust S&P 500 performance that reduced NVDA’s relative advantage. Similarly, the above charts reveals some trends regarding the beta of the NVDA(Nvidia) stock: ● The time series of NVIDIA’s(NVDA) beta relative to the S&P 500 reveals a significant evolution in the stock’s sensitivity to market movements over the period from October 2023 to August 2025. ● Initially, NVDA exhibited a beta around 2.0, indicating that it was approximately twice as volatile as the broader market. Over the course of 2024, beta steadily increased, peaking near 2.9 in early 2025, reflecting heightened market exposure and amplified price swings during periods of strong investor enthusiasm for AI-driven growth. ● This elevated beta suggests that NVDA was behaving as a high-risk, high-reward asset, with returns highly correlated to-and often magnified by-market trends. However, beginning in April 2025, beta experienced a sharp decline, falling to 1.985 by August 2025, signaling a reduction in its volatility relative to the market. This decrease may reflect a combination of factors: valuation corrections, reduced speculative positioning, and a shift toward more stable, earnings-driven investment behavior. Hence, a portfolio manager when looking at the historical performance of NVDA, will be able to evaluate if the trade is adding value to their portfolio. A stock with a rising alpha and lower beta is a good sign for investment, since it presents a higher return for a lower level of risk. An evaluation of single stocks comprising a portfolio will give a good visual analysis of the stocks risk and return and the overall portfolio. A similar analysis can be conducted at the portfolio level as well to understand the portfolio manager’s performance- alpha creation against the market similar to an AMC tracking a fund’s performance. Rolling alpha and beta are not just statistics-they are mirrors. They allow students to: ● See the consequences of their strategies ● Distinguish luck from skill ● Adjust risk in response to market regimes This system has direct real-world applicability: ● Can be scaled to real fund management with minimal changes ● Provides a template for risk dashboards in small asset managers ● Integrates with automated compliance or alerting(e.g., “beta increased by 30% this month”) By turning student trades into living data, we move beyond theory to reflective practice. And by building in Clojure, we ensure that the system is not a black box—but an open book. In simple words we can decipher, the best financial models don’t just describe the world—they help people learn from it. ● Expand to multi-factor rolling models(e.g., FF3: market, size, value) ● Build a web dashboard using ClojureScript(Reagent) for real-time feedback and interactivity ● Implement automated alerts(e.g., “your beta has exceeded 1.5”) ● Add peer benchmarking: compare alpha trajectories across students ● Integrate with portfolio optimization tools for next-step recommendations ● Use the pipeline as a capstone module in investment management courses

CoreWeave (CRWV) said Monday it has signed a $6.3 billion initial order with Nvidia (NVDA) with a condition that the AI chip star buys unsold capacity, sending shares in the cloud computing platform surging. As part of the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any unsold cloud-computing capacity through April 13, 2032, if CoreWeave’s data centers aren’t fully utilized by its own customers. CoreWeave made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said the deal was struck on Sept. 9. Nvidia has ties with CoreWeave on several fronts. Apart from being a customer, Nvidia sells its chips to CoreWeave and has a stake in the cloud platform. Apart from Nvidia, CoreWeave’s customers include Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META). Separately, on Monday, Deutsche Bank added CoreWeave to its Catalyst Call Buy Idea List, citing “a few positive factors" that will support revenue revisions upward over the next quarter or two. CoreWeave will benefit as “spending intentions being signaled by those in industry and the scale of some of the recent contract announcements make demand for AI infrastructure appear almost insatiable and at least for the near-to-medium-term, demand significantly outstrips supply," wrote analyst Brad Zelnick. CoreWeave shares are rising almost 7% in intraday trading Monday and have gained more than 200% since going public in March this year in one of 2025’s hottest IPOs.

U.S. equities were higher at midday on positive comments about China trade and the future of TikTok from President Trump, as well as Tesla (TSLA) news. S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Tesla shares jumped as a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk purchased 2.57 million shares of the electric vehicle's stock valued at about $1 billion. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) traded above $200 for the first time on continued excitement over the company's new hard disk drive for artificial intelligence data centers. Intel (INTC) shares climbed after the struggling semiconductor maker reduced its target for full-year non-GAAP operating expenses after completing the $3.3 billion sale of a majority stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares were up for a third straight session, making the parent of Google the fourth company with a $3 trillion market capitalization. Corteva (CTVA) was among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 following a report that the manufacturer of crop seeds and pesticides is looking into splitting itself into two separate companies. Some chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), fell as Chinese regulators were investigating potential dumping of analog integrated circuit semiconductors from the U.S. U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca (AZN) declined after a report the drugmaker had paused a planned $272 million investment in Britain, and received a downgrade from Europe's Handelsbanken. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dipped.

Investa, the UK’s first zero-commission options trading app, is now available to investors after an active soft launch where over 1400 trades were facilitated — putting what they believe is an under-utilised investment product in reach of on-the-go traders and more sophisticated investors. 1 15 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The app, available on iOS, has been built by a team of former Citi options brokers and the co-founder of Freetrade, Ian Fuller. It was created to address the access gap in options trading for UK investors. It will be launched on Android in the months ahead. An option is a contract between two parties that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date. In exchange for this right, the buyer pays a premium. There are two main types of listed, tradeable options: Call option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Put option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Under 2% of UK retail investors have traded an option, compared with nearly 20% in the US, a gap Investa believes is driven by high costs, complex platforms and limited access. Addressing these challenges, the Investa app offers a streamlined experience designed around education, clarity, accessibility and transparency. Early feedback from the soft launch has been built into the app’s final features and interface. Key app features include: Zero commission (other fees apply) Access to over 200 stocks and ETFs with over 100,000 options contracts to trade No margin, cash accounts onlyClear, jargon-free terminology Intuitively designed options cards that strip back complexity During the soft launch, trading favourites included Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nike (NKE), with Nvidia alone representing over 20% of options activity. Alec Beasley, Co–founder and CEO of Investa, commented: “Our goal is to make the options market more accessible to savvy UK investors, as we believe it offers huge untapped opportunities. There is not a lack of interest in options trading, but rather a lack of access. High fees, confusing platforms and limited availability have kept UK investors out and we are directly addressing that gap. “The feedback from our soft launch was invaluable and has directly influenced the features and interface that are live today. We’re also enabling investors to join us on our journey through our second Crowdcube round as we strongly believe in community ownership. “Options trading has traditionally been an exclusive market, and we want to change that not only through the product but also through how we fund the company. Crowdfunding allows our early adopters to become shareholders and grow with us.” Marios Syrimis, Investa Investor and User, added: “I had tried options trading on other platforms, but it was difficult to get set up and their hidden fees were frustrating. I’ve traded on Investa several times now and have found the execution incredibly smooth. The user interface makes the options experience intuitive, which made it easy for me to get started. As both an investor and a customer, it’s refreshing to finally find a platform that really cares about making options accessible to UK investors.” The public launch of the app coincides with Investa’s second fundraising campaign on Crowdcube, following its record-breaking 2024 round that attracted just shy of 500 investors — the most participated-in UK fintech raise on Crowdcube that year. In its second Crowdcube raise, Investa is on a mission to target at least £1m, which will be used to develop and launch an Android app, scale its marketing operations, expand its product features, and grow the customer base following the public launch of the

Title: CoreWeave Stock Climbs 5% After $6.3B Cloud Capacity Deal with Nvidia

CoreWeave (CRWV) were higher by about 5% in early U.S. trading Monday after the cloud computing company entered into a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to guarantee use of its excess server capacity, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the agreement, Nvidia will buy any unused computing resources from CoreWeave through April 2032. The arrangement ensures that CoreWeave’s vast fleet of data centers will not sit idle if customer demand fluctuates. If CoreWeave’s clients don’t fully book its servers, Nvidia is obligated to step in and purchase the residual capacity. Either company can exit the deal if one breaches terms or faces bankruptcy. For CoreWeave, the agreement locks in a long-term buyer for its spare capacity, reducing revenue risk as it builds out infrastructure. For Nvidia, it secures reliable access to cloud-based GPU resources at a time when demand for artificial intelligence training far exceeds supply. The agreement also strengthens ties between the two firms, as Nvidia not only supplies CoreWeave with GPUs but also holds an equity stake. Nvidia has already made CoreWeave one of its biggest bets. At the end of the second quarter, the AI chipmaker owned 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave worth about $3.96 billion. CoreWeave, founded in 2017, rents out access to Nvidia graphics processing units that power AI model training. The firm went public in March in what was the largest U.S. venture-backed tech IPO since 2021. Leading up to its debut, it raised billions in debt and equity financing, including from Nvidia itself. The stock surged roughly five-fold shortly following its April IPO, but subsequently lost about 50% during the summer. They've rebounded by about 35% since Labor Day.
