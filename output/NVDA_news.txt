October 13, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced that Meta and Oracle will boost their AI data center networks with NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking switches. Meta and Oracle are standardizing on Spectrum-X Ethernet switches as an open, accelerated networking architecture that speeds deployment at scale, unlocks exponential gains in AI training efficiency and shortens time to insights. “Trillion-parameter models are transforming data centers into giga-scale AI factories, and industry leaders like Meta and Oracle are standardizing on Spectrum-X Ethernet to drive this industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Spectrum-X is not just faster Ethernet — it’s the nervous system of the AI factory, enabling hyperscalers to connect millions of GPUs into a single giant computer to train the largest models ever built.” Oracle will build giga-scale AI factories accelerated by the NVIDIA Vera Rubin architecture and interconnected by Spectrum-X Ethernet. “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is designed from the ground up for AI workloads, and our partnership with NVIDIA extends that AI leadership,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “By adopting Spectrum-X Ethernet, we can interconnect millions of GPUs with breakthrough efficiency so our customers can more quickly train, deploy and benefit from the next wave of generative and reasoning AI.” Meta will integrate Spectrum Ethernet switches into its networking infrastructure for the Facebook Open Switching System (“FBOSS”), a software platform developed to manage and control network switches at massive scale. This integration will speed deployment at scale to unlock gains in AI training efficiency and shorten time to insights. “Meta’s next-generation AI infrastructure requires open and efficient networking at a scale the industry has never seen before,” said Gaya Nagarajan, vice president of networking engineering at Meta. “By integrating NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet into the Minipack3N switch and FBOSS, we can extend our open networking approach while unlocking the efficiency and predictability needed to train ever-larger models and bring generative AI applications to billions of people.” NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet PlatformDesigned for the trillion-parameter model era, the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, consisting of Spectrum-X Ethernet switches and Spectrum-X Ethernet SuperNICs, is the first Ethernet platform purpose-built for AI, enabling hyperscalers to interconnect millions of GPUs with unprecedented efficiency and scale. Trillion-parameter models and generative AI are redefining the scale of data centers. Spectrum-X Ethernet enables AI at scale, delivering the performance and scalability needed to build the world’s most advanced AI infrastructure. Spectrum-X Ethernet has already demonstrated record-setting efficiency, enabling the world’s largest AI supercomputer to achieve 95% data throughput with its congestion-control technology. By contrast, off-the-shelf Ethernet at scale suffers from thousands of flow collisions, limiting throughput to roughly 60%. This leap in efficiency marks a breakthrough in the economics and performance of AI-scale networking. NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, enables scale-across capabilities to link data centers across cities, nations and continents into vast, giga-scale AI super-factories. Spectrum-X builds on NVIDIA’s full-stack platform — including GPUs, CPUs, NVIDIA NVLink™ and software — to deliver seamless performance from compute to network. Its advanced congestion control, adaptive routing and AI-driven telemetry capabilities ensure efficiency and predictability for massive AI training and inference clusters.

Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/
Time Published: 2025-10-12T14:00:00Z

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.

High-flying tech stocks led the S&P 500 lower Friday, Oct. 10, 2025, amid worries about worsening U.S.-China relations. Meanwhile, a snack food and soda maker built on its momentum in the wake of an upbeat quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes plunged after President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on imports from China and suggested he may cancel his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in response to China's moves to curb rare earths exports. The S&P 500 slumped 2.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.6%. The Dow lost 1.9%. For more reporting from Investopedia on today's market moves, see here. Chip design software firm Synopsys (SNPS), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Teradyne (TER), and other semiconductor-related stocks were among the S&P 500's biggest decliners. AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) finished nearly 5% lower after climbing to a fresh intraday record ahead of Trump's comments. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also dropped about 5% amid broad-based declines, with the tech sector taking the heaviest hit. Consumer staples marked the only sector in the S&P 500 to post gains. PepsiCo (PEP) shares rose nearly 4% to secure the S&P 500's top performance on Friday. The stock added to its jump in the prior session after the snack and soft drink giant posted better-than-expected quarterly results and named a new chief financial officer. Growth in international markets helped drive Pepsi's strong performance, despite declining volumes in North America. Shares of auto parts retailers clawed back some of the steep losses they suffered over the past week following a Chapter 11 bankruptcy by supplier First Brands. The collapse of the company behind a number of major brands for products like filters, brakes, and wipers could disrupt supply and pricing for the parts sellers. AutoZone (AZO) shares recovered 2.7% Friday after the company authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion worth in its stock. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) stock was up 2.4%.

Title: Top Stock Movers Now: AMD, Arm, Levi Strauss, and More

The major U.S. equities indexes dropped sharply Friday afternoon, wiping out early gains after President Trump threatened "massive" tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China’s move to tighten rare earths export curbs. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all lost over 1%. China is a leading producer for rare earths that are critical components in a wide range of high-tech products from cars to semiconductors, and chip stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Arm (ARM) were among the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's biggest decliners. Shares of AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) also turned lower after climbing to a fresh intraday record, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 4%. Adding to Qualcomm's (QCOM) woes was a report that Chinese regulators are investigating the chipmaker’s purchase of Israel-based car safety semiconductor manufacturer Autotalks over possible antitrust violations. Mosaic (MOS) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the fertilizer maker reported problems at two of its plants significantly held back production. Shares of Levi Strauss (LEVI) also dropped after the jeans maker said tariffs would negatively impact current-quarter results. PepsiCo (PEP) shares added to yesterday's gains after the soft drink and snacks maker posted better-than-expected results on higher international demand and strong sales of its healthier drinks in the U.S. Shares of Applied Digital (APLD) took off as the AI data center firm also beat earnings and revenue forecasts on higher demand for its services, which included a new data center lease agreement with AI computing firm CoreWeave (CRWD). Gold prices rose, and oil futures sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies lost ground.

Qualcomm (QCOM) shares declined Friday following news Chinese regulators have opened an antitrust investigation of the chipmaker’s June purchase of Israel-based car safety semiconductor manufacturer Autotalks. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation wrote in a statement seen by news organizations that it would be looking into whether Qualcomm unlawfully withheld certain details about the acquisition. China's antitrust investigation into Qualcomm’s acquisition of Autotalks puts a spotlight on tensions that could affect U.S.-China trade talks. The investigation may influence Qualcomm’s operations in the region, which could weigh on investor sentiment. Bloomberg reported that Beijing was targeting Qualcomm as part of an effort to gain leverage ahead of trade talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expected at the end of the month. It noted China has already announced an antitrust probe of Nvidia (NVDA), and has slapped curbs on exports of rare earth and other key minerals to the U.S., as well as limiting imports of soybeans from American farmers. Qualcomm did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment before publication. Shares of the company have gained 3% since the start of the year, trailing the performance of tech stocks that have surged amid booming demand for AI.

Title: Comfort Makes You Poor - The Snowball Strategy That Builds Wealth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2025/10/10/comfort-makes-you-poorthe-snowball-strategy-that-builds-wealth/
Time Published: 2025-10-10T14:07:12Z

ByJon Markman, Contributor. The Two Paths to Investing: Conviction vs. Comfort Every investor is offered two paths: the comfortable, well-lit path of following the crowd and listening to the latest fear-mongering, or the quiet, proven path of conviction and compounding. The first path is an illusion (a trap that leads to mediocrity). The second is the only road to real, generational wealth. The biggest stumbling block for most investors isn’t the market; it’s emotion. People instinctively seek comfort, which means they often fall victim to tall tales of doom from analysts or economists who consistently lag the market. The data doesn’t lie: over every time frame, these advisors underperform the S&P 500. They sell bottoms and urge switching from winners to tired value stocks, leading investors away from long-term success. Professional fund managers are no exception. In 2025, only about 30% are matching or beating the S&P. The stark reality is this: most are paid well for mediocrity and actively encourage costly portfolio churn. They construct narratives to justify cautious moves, rarely providing the conviction that real wealth-building requires. The Secret Weapon: Harnessing the Snowball Effect We don’t talk about timing the market; we talk about harnessing the most powerful, yet patient, force in finance: Compounding. It’s not a straight line; it’s a snowball rolling down a hill (slowly at first, gathering mass, and then, inexorably, becoming an unstoppable force that creates fortune out of patience). Not many advisors talk about this because their business model depends on activity, not patience. Our business is built on the opposite: allowing this magic to work. When investors buy and hold great stocks, they allow compounding to work its magic, earning profits on profits. Real wealth stems from holding, not trading, exceptional businesses over decades. We have told this story before, but it bears repeating. We put Markman Capital members into Nvidia (NVDA) a decade before ChatGPT. We did this because our research showed Nvidia was building a business at the vanguard of a huge secular trend. Adjusted for stock splits, many members own shares from 50 cents. Today, Nvidia trades at $192.50. This has been a life-changing investment, but there have been challenges. Think back to 2022. Imagine you held shares of Nvidia, a company we knew was poised to dominate for the foreseeable future, and the stock price had just been cut in half. The talking heads were screaming “sell.” Fear was palpable. That moment, that overwhelming feeling of doubt, that was the test. Markman Capital members didn’t just hold; they acted with conviction and bought even more. The business fundamentals had not changed. The secular tailwind was far from complete. The talkers missed the return because they failed the emotional test. They chased safety, missing the growth that only discipline and long-term vision could deliver. The Test of Discipline What stops most investors? Fear. Fear of loss, regret, and missing out. The industry profits by stoking these emotions, pushing protection products and constant analysis. Ignore the noise. Mastery in investing is not found in prediction; it is found in the discipline to act with conviction while others are paralyzed by volatility. Here are four other stocks for steadfast accumulation: businesses with a long track record of operational excellence and sustained profit growth: Netflix (NFLX), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Costco Wholesale (COST), and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG). Buy them with a decade-long mindset. Add to positions during deep declines. Leave the short-term trading to nervous hands. Compounding doesn’t need perfect timing. It needs great businesses and the ability to leave them alone, letting profits snowball across decades. Markman Capital’s history, not just Nvidia, but dozens of holdings, proves this principle works quietly but inexorably. Conviction, not comfort, is the true engine of wealth. Stick with the simple, proven method. Buy and hold. As always, today’s advice is simple, yet profound. Choose greatness. Stay disciplined. Resist drama and noise. Let compounding do the heavy lifting. In a world awash in anxious forecasts, let this be your anchor. Choose conviction, not comfort. Share this with someone selling bottoms and calling it “prudence.”
