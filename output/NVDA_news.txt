Title: AMD, Marvell, Intel: Which Is The Next Multi-Trillion Chip Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/09/amd-marvell-intel-which-is-the-next-multi-trillion-chip-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T11:53:10Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made news by entering into a significant agreement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to provide tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing power over the forthcoming five years. The initial gigawatt comprising AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 chips will be delivered in the latter half of 2026. This contract signifies one of the largest individual chip acquisitions ever made in the AI industry and highlights OpenAI's efforts to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond the industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which commands over 75% of the AI computing market. This strategic shift could represent a pivotal moment, not only for AMD but also for the ongoing expansion of the AI computing sector, opening avenues for emerging leaders in the AI semiconductor arena. The next phase of the AI computing race will no longer be about just training large language models – it’s increasingly about inference, or putting AI to work in the real world. Training is akin to teaching an AI model everything they know, while inference is when that knowledge is applied – answering questions, generating text, or running chatbots millions of times a day. As AI applications scale to hundreds of millions of users, the demand for inference capacity is set to explode. Running these workloads efficiently has become the new bottleneck, forcing companies to rethink how and where they deploy compute. Nvidia has dominated training with its H100 and A100 GPUs, but inference could shift the equation. Once models are trained, they must run continuously across billions of devices, making energy efficiency, latency, and hardware availability crucial factors. Nvidia Stock 2x To $350? That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As AI matures, more of the value creation could shift from training toward inference. Morgan Stanley projects roughly $3 trillion will be invested into the AI build out over the next three years – and it is likely that a significant portion will flow toward inference. To put this in perspective: Nvidia’s market cap is currently around $4.5 trillion, fueled largely by its dominance in training. But inference could actually be the bigger market. In the coming years, inference could easily surpass training in total revenue and total GPU units shipped, opening a new frontier in the AI chip race. This could favor companies that offer cheaper, more energy-efficient, and readily available chips, not just the most powerful ones. This shift opens the field to a broader range of players. So who are the potential winners here? Nvidia is likely to remain a leading player even as the AI market shifts. The company’s deeply entrenched software ecosystem – including CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN – are likely to have locked in many early customers. It is also adapting its product line, focusing on powerful new chip architectures for inference and optimized inference software to meet growing workloads from video generation to large-scale real-time AI applications. Combined with its strong partnerships across hyperscalers, AI startups, and enterprise customers, the company is likely to remain an AI leader, although it’s very likely that its share of the AI compute market will trend lower. AMD has considerably lagged Nvidia in the early stage of the AI build out, but it could emerge as a key challenger to Nvidia in inference. The OpenAI partnership further validates AMD’s position as a serious inference player and signals that the company is steadily carving out a place as a preferred provider for scalable, efficient AI compute solutions. AMD chips are increasingly competitive in performance while offering cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations need or can afford Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs. Many are likely to opt for older Nvidia chips or cost-effective alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which offer solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Intel might seem like a wildcard in the AI chip race, but it has a credible shot at the inference market. Its broad portfolio – including CPUs, Gaudi Habana accelerators, and an extensive datacenter ecosystem – positions Intel to deliver energy-efficient, high-volume inference solutions. Intel’s fabs could benefit as AI inference drives demand for high volumes of lower- to mid-tier chips, which Intel may be more well-positioned to produce for other companies. While its Intel’s process technology lags the likes of TSMC at the cutting edge for top-tier GPUs, it is probably more than capable of fabricating efficient, cost-effective inference chips. See: OpenAI’s Next Bet: Intel Stock? ASIC, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are increasingly gaining attention in the AI space. Unlike versatile, general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are engineered for a single task, making them far more cost- and energy-efficient for large-scale inference workloads. The crypto industry offers a clear precedent: Bitcoin mining initially relied on GPUs, but rapidly shifted to ASICs once scale and efficiency became paramount. related How Marvell Stock Surges To $140 A similar evolution could play out in AI inference. Two companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are Marvell, which has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, and Broadcom, both with proven expertise in designing custom silicon for hyperscalers. Broadcom, in particular, has emerged as a standout, securing a $10 billion deal with OpenAI. Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? U.S. Big Tech such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are all designing AI chips. Amazon has leaned into training-focused chips, Meta started with inference and is expanding to training, while Google supports both through its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the motivation is not necessarily to beat Nvidia in the market but to lower costs, gain supply control, and improve bargaining power within their massive cloud ecosystems. Over time, that means less incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Over Q2, Nvidia said that just two of its customers made up roughly 39% of total revenue — likely these big U.S. tech firms — making it vulnerable if they shift workloads to in-house silicon or lower-cost suppliers. Chinese Internet Giants In China, companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Huawei are stepping up their AI chip efforts. Recent reports suggested that Alibaba plans to launch a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to power inference at scale using its own tech stack, and to secure a steady supply of semiconductors amid U.S. export restrictions. For now, Nvidia’s GPUs are still expected to form the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training workloads, but inference is likely to become the longer-term growth driver for the company. related Alibaba’s AI Chip A Big Deal? Beyond semiconductors, growing AI inference workloads will drive demand for supporting infrastructure. Fast, reliable, and intelligent networking will be critical to handle billions of requests daily. Companies like Arista Networks and Cisco are well-positioned to benefit, as ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects become essential for moving massive datasets between servers, GPUs, and cloud nodes in real time. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

An AI chipmaker's stock extended its rally in the wake of a major artificial intelligence deal. Meanwhile, the latest salvo in an escalating competition between credit score providers weighed on one of the industry's big players. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to set fresh closing highs, bolstered by gains in the tech sector and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggesting the central bank could be on track toward more interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow was little changed. Find Investopedia's full daily market recap here. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares posted the day's best performance in the S&P 500 index with a nearly 12% jump, extending their winning streak following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI. A slew of analysts have raised their price targets for AMD this week, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to "buy" from "hold." Dell Technologies (DELL) shares surged 9.1%, after the server maker raised its outlook, citing strong demand driven by the buildout of AI infrastructure. CEO Michael Dell said the company's broad portfolio of tech products makes it well positioned to provide the compute, storage, and network capacity necessary to deploy AI at scale. Optimism around AI helped boost other companies with exposure to the burgeoning technology as well. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) rose about 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to keep growing. Equifax (EFX) announced it will provide its VantageScore 4.0 credit scores at a reduced price or free to customers, just days after Fair Isaac (FICO) said last week that it would offer its FICO credit scores directly to firms that provide credit reports to lenders, reducing reliance on Equifax and the other nationwide credit bureaus. Fair Isaac shares dropped nearly 10%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and reversing a portion of the gains posted after last week's announcement, while Equifax shares advanced close to 1%. Live Nation (LYV) shares fell 3.4% after the Ticketmaster parent announced a plan to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes maturing in 2031. The live entertainment company intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to redeem senior notes due in 2026, repay other debt, and for general corporate purposes.

Demand for artificial intelligence is booming and only just getting started, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially,” the CEO told CNBC in a televised interview Wednesday, adding that that he believes the AI boom is still in its early stages, leaving room for further growth. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were up 2% in recent trading, contributing to a rally in the tech sector. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom has seen its stock climb roughly 40% so far in 2025 as sales of its chips to power data centers surged and trade policy headwinds eased. Its move this year has helped propel Nvidia into the top spot as the world's most valuable public company, and made its CEO one of the richest people in the world. As a leading beneficiary of the AI boom, Nvidia has become something of a bellwether for the AI trade, with changes in its business and big moves in its stock able to influence broader markets. Shares of Nvidia partners such as Micron Technology (MU) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) also climbed Wednesday, adding to gains earlier in the week on a massive OpenAI deal with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also collaborates with the companies. AMD's deal came just weeks after Nvidia announced its own deal with OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a social media post Monday that the startup views its AMD deal as incremental to the ChatGPT maker's work with Nvidia, and that "the world needs much more compute." The move raised speculation more high-profile partnerships could be in the works, affecting a growing number of companies, with several Wall Street analysts likening the signal of strong demand for AI to a rising tide that lifts all boats. Huang said Wednesday that his only regret is not investing more in major AI players like OpenAI and CoreWeave (CRWV), an AI data center provider in which Nvidia holds a stake. The CEO also gave a shoutout to Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, saying Nvidia is investing in Musk's xAI and that “almost everything that Elon is part of, you really want to be part of as well." Shares of the EV maker, which were up about 1% Wednesday, have been on a tear in recent weeks, adding roughly a third of their value since the start of September as bulls have shifted more of their focus to the company's developments in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to grow further. Shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led gains on the S&P 500, adding to their recent rally in the wake of a deal with OpenAI. Dell Technology (DELL) also jumped, after the server maker reported yesterday that it sees a “massive” growth opportunity in AI as it raised its outlook. AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) shares soared to a record high as the provider of space-based cellphone service and Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed on a partnership to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. Credit score data provider Fair Isaac (FICO) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after score reporter Equifax (EFX) slashed prices in response to Fair Isaac providing its information directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage companies. Equifax shares advanced. DaVita (DVA) shares declined as Barclays lowered its price target for the kidney dialysis service provider's stock, pointing to a cyberattack that disrupted operations in August. Gold prices high a fresh high, and oil futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar was higher versus the euro, pound, and yen.

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. By now, it’s glaringly obvious: AI is replacing workers. And it’s boosting corporate bottom lines as it does. I call this the “growth-without-hiring” trend, and it’s accelerating. Today we’re going to grab our share in the form of big dividends (up to 8.1%) and upside, too. The latest evidence that “growth without hiring” is the real deal? The September ADP payrolls report, which showed that companies cut 32,000 positions. The August numbers were also revised to 3,000 losses, not the 54,000 gains originally reported. With numbers like those, you’d expect the US to be in recession, or close to it. Nope. According to the Atlanta Fed’s up-to-the-minute GDPNow indicator, the economy grew a fit 3.8% annualized in the just-completed third quarter. Numbers from companies themselves back up this shift. IT consulting firm Accenture plc (ACN), for example, laid off more than 11,000 employees in the last three months and has said more cuts are coming as part of its AI-focused restructuring. But while Accenture’s workers pack their banker’s boxes, its profits are soaring: In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, revenue jumped 7%. For fiscal 2026, it expects a 2% to 5% revenue boost and a 5% to 8% increase in adjusted EPS. (Too bad ACN’s 2.6% divvie isn’t enough to get our hearts racing.) We’ve talked about this trend before, first in tech and then as it’s spread into other industries, including insurance and even agriculture. And this is where our dividend opportunity comes in, including that shot at payouts up to 8.1%. To be sure, that payout is not coming from the popular AI plays. I probably don’t have to tell you that NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) pay somewhere between nothing and almost nothing. Instead, we’re buying through closed-end funds (CEFs), for three reasons: That last point is vital because most of the profits from AI will flow to companies that use the tech, rather than those that develop it. Accenture is a good example, but think of insurers using AI to read medical records and process claims in minutes. Or banks using it to make better decisions on exactly who they want to lend to—and who they don’t. With that, here are three CEFs that come at it through developers, users and (our sweetest dividend deal of the three) firms feeding AI’s bottomless power demand. QQQX, as the name says, holds the stocks in the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: to the tune of 8.1%. The fund can pay that high divvie thanks to its strategy of selling call options on its portfolio. Under this scheme, it sells option buyers the right to buy its stocks in the future at a fixed price. It keeps the fee it charges for that right. Hence, that healthy 8.1% payout. This strategy generates the most cash when markets are volatile, and more volatility is likely, considering the rocket ride stocks have been on. QQQX’s portfolio includes all the big tech kingpins, plus some firms on the user side of AI, too, like travel-site operator Booking Holdings (BKG), which uses AI to help travelers save time by letting them ask specific questions about a vacation property—like whether it has a beach view, for example. It also offers an AI summary of reviews. No more endless scrolling. The fund also sports an 8.2% discount as I write this, which is good … but not quite as good as it was earlier this year, when it sunk to double digits: That’s why I rate QQQX, a holding in my Contrarian Income Report advisory, a hold for now. Once it flips to a buy in our portfolio, members of the service will know right away. “Growth-Without-Hiring” Dividend #2: Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund (KYN) Artificial intelligence is supposed to be graceful, just code humming in the cloud. Yet it’s anything but lightweight. AI is an energy hog. Every time a chatbot like ChatGPT spits out an answer, it pulls from enormous racks of servers running in data centers. Those servers draw power on the scale of small cities. AI can’t happen without natural gas. Renewables are growing, for sure, but most new data centers are still tied to gas-fired plants. Gas is abundant and reliable, and it fires up quickly when demand surges. Which means every new AI deployment is more business for the gas lines feeding those power plants. KYN is a savvy CEF play on this situation, sporting a portfolio that reads like a who’s-who of big US pipeline operators, including Kinder Morgan (KMI), ONEOK (OKE) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) like Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). (Bonus: With KYN, you get a simple form 1099 for reporting your dividends at tax time, not the complicated K-1 package you—or your accountant—would have to deal with if you bought these MLPs “direct”.) KYN collects “tolls” on the gas flowing through its holdings’ pipes and hands them to us as a 7.5% divvie. And while plenty of investors have made the connection between AI’s power needs and utility stocks, they haven’t yet made the leap to pipelines. That’s handed us “second-level” thinkers a likely-time-limited chance to buy KYN an 11%-off deal that’s actually gotten cheaper this year: My take? It’s only a matter of time before the “first-level” crowd realizes just how good AI will be for gas pipelines—and sends that discount hurtling toward a premium. GDV focuses on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses. Top holdings include Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and American Express (AXP). GDV yields 6.2% and hasn’t cut its payout since the 2008 financial crisis. The fund’s discount had been narrowing lately, but it recently widened to 11%, giving us another chance to get in cheap: I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance. GDV is an especially sweet deal when you consider that the fund has been outperforming the S&P 500 on a total-return basis this year: 18% to 15% as I write this. Throw in a tailwind from “growth-without-hiring”—especially as the trend spreads from tech to other parts of the economy—and you get a sense of the opportunity for upside (and high, steady dividends) here.

Title: These Stocks Score From AMD's OpenAI Deal, Wall Street Analysts Say

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a number of partners that could be set to benefit from its big deal with OpenAI, according to Wall Street analysts. The ChatGPT maker committed to buying several generations of AMD's AI chips, sending shares of the semiconductor firm up 24% yesterday and another 4% on Tuesday. The announcement also boosted shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), Dell Technologies (DELL), and others that have business with AMD. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see current AMD partners and AI server makers Supermicro, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as poised to gain from the deal. They also highlighted Arista Networks (ANET) and Sanmina (SANM), which earlier this year agreed to buy ZT Systems’ Data Center Infrastructure manufacturing business from AMD and became a preferred manufacturing partner as part of the agreement. Several analysts suggested AMD's deal could be taken as a positive signal for the semiconductor sector and AI trade broadly, though they pointed to some of AMD's networking partners as more direct beneficiaries. The deal underscores the wide-ranging impact of the surge in AI demand on companies and stocks, with analysts likening the AI boom to a rising tide that lifts all boats. "While the announcements till date from OpenAI have largely focused on tight partnerships with semiconductor companies, we expect to see similar partnerships with Hardware and Networking companies as critical to scaling infrastructure," J.P. Morgan said. Citi analysts said they see AMD's OpenAI agreement as presenting a positive read-through for memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) and Astera Labs as well. Astera, which supplies connectivity solutions for AI data centers and counts Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD as customers, saw its stock pop 10% Monday, before pulling back Tuesday.
