As Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms analyze huge amounts of data to detect configurations indicative of cyber threats. Additionally, AI can scan complete networks for faults to help avoid common types of cyberattacks. AI predominantly monitors and examines activities and patterns. By leveraging a baseline of normal behavior, AI can identify anomalies and limit illegal access to systems. A report from Fortune Business Insights projected that the global AI in cybersecurity market size was valued at USD 26.55 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow from USD 34.10 billion in 2025 to USD 234.64 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 31.70% during the forecast period. North America dominated the market with a share of 36.31% in 2024. The report said: "Leveraging Generative AI Capabilities to Detect Emerging Threats Creates Lucrative Market Opportunities: To protect their operations, enterprises need to develop a clear approach to incorporating AI and generative AI technologies into their present security systems. This involves continuously reevaluating the security setting to detect emerging risks and ensuring the necessary infrastructure is in place. Key components include advanced data management solutions, cloud computing resources, strong governance, and policies to safeguard data integrity and safety. Additionally, companies invest in artificial intelligence and generative AI solutions that improve Security Operations Center (SOC) capabilities, offer comprehensive AI-based cybersecurity training for employees, and increase employee awareness of potential risks." Active Companies in the markets this week include iQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), Okta, Inc.

AI-based behavioral analytics can efficiently identify manipulative, subtle cues that signal phishing and other deceptive tactics, significantly minimizing the occurrence of successful attacks. Thus, the increase in different kinds of social engineering attacks augments the demand for artificial intelligence in cybersecurity solutions in the market." It concluded: "The North America region led the market size in 2024 by USD 9.64 billion in 2024, and USD 7.97 billion in 2023. The region held the highest market share in 2024 due to the presence of high-tech enterprises across various sectors such as BFSI, IT & telecom, healthcare, and others.

Title: AMD, Marvell, Intel: Which Is The Next Multi-Trillion Chip Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/09/amd-marvell-intel-which-is-the-next-multi-trillion-chip-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T11:53:10Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made news by entering into a significant agreement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to provide tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing power over the forthcoming five years. The initial gigawatt comprising AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 chips will be delivered in the latter half of 2026. This contract signifies one of the largest individual chip acquisitions ever made in the AI industry and highlights OpenAI's efforts to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond the industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which commands over 75% of the AI computing market. This strategic shift could represent a pivotal moment, not only for AMD but also for the ongoing expansion of the AI computing sector, opening avenues for emerging leaders in the AI semiconductor arena. The next phase of the AI computing race will no longer be about just training large language models – it’s increasingly about inference, or putting AI to work in the real world. Training is akin to teaching an AI model everything they know, while inference is when that knowledge is applied – answering questions, generating text, or running chatbots millions of times a day. As AI applications scale to hundreds of millions of users, the demand for inference capacity is set to explode. Running these workloads efficiently has become the new bottleneck, forcing companies to rethink how and where they deploy compute. Nvidia has dominated training with its H100 and A100 GPUs, but inference could shift the equation. Once models are trained, they must run continuously across billions of devices, making energy efficiency, latency, and hardware availability crucial factors. Nvidia Stock 2x To $350? That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As AI matures, more of the value creation could shift from training toward inference. Morgan Stanley projects roughly $3 trillion will be invested into the AI build out over the next three years – and it is likely that a significant portion will flow toward inference. To put this in perspective: Nvidia’s market cap is currently around $4.5 trillion, fueled largely by its dominance in training. But inference could actually be the bigger market. In the coming years, inference could easily surpass training in total revenue and total GPU units shipped, opening a new frontier in the AI chip race. This could favor companies that offer cheaper, more energy-efficient, and readily available chips, not just the most powerful ones. This shift opens the field to a broader range of players. So who are the potential winners here? Nvidia is likely to remain a leading player even as the AI market shifts. The company’s deeply entrenched software ecosystem – including CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN – are likely to have locked in many early customers. It is also adapting its product line, focusing on powerful new chip architectures for inference and optimized inference software to meet growing workloads from video generation to large-scale real-time AI applications. Combined with its strong partnerships across hyperscalers, AI startups, and enterprise customers, the company is likely to remain an AI leader, although it’s very likely that its share of the AI compute market will trend lower. AMD has considerably lagged Nvidia in the early stage of the AI build out, but it could emerge as a key challenger to Nvidia in inference. The OpenAI partnership further validates AMD’s position as a serious inference player and signals that the company is steadily carving out a place as a preferred provider for scalable, efficient AI compute solutions. AMD chips are increasingly competitive in performance while offering cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations need or can afford Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs. Many are likely to opt for older Nvidia chips or cost-effective alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which offer solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Intel might seem like a wildcard in the AI chip race, but it has a credible shot at the inference market. Its broad portfolio – including CPUs, Gaudi Habana accelerators, and an extensive datacenter ecosystem – positions Intel to deliver energy-efficient, high-volume inference solutions. Intel’s fabs could benefit as AI inference drives demand for high volumes of lower- to mid-tier chips, which Intel may be more well-positioned to produce for other companies. While its Intel’s process technology lags the likes of TSMC at the cutting edge for top-tier GPUs, it is probably more than capable of fabricating efficient, cost-effective inference chips. See: OpenAI’s Next Bet: Intel Stock? ASIC, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are increasingly gaining attention in the AI space. Unlike versatile, general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are engineered for a single task, making them far more cost- and energy-efficient for large-scale inference workloads. The crypto industry offers a clear precedent: Bitcoin mining initially relied on GPUs, but rapidly shifted to ASICs once scale and efficiency became paramount. related How Marvell Stock Surges To $140 A similar evolution could play out in AI inference. Two companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are Marvell, which has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, and Broadcom, both with proven expertise in designing custom silicon for hyperscalers. Broadcom, in particular, has emerged as a standout, securing a $10 billion deal with OpenAI. Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? U.S. Big Tech such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are all designing AI chips. Amazon has leaned into training-focused chips, Meta started with inference and is expanding to training, while Google supports both through its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the motivation is not necessarily to beat Nvidia in the market but to lower costs, gain supply control, and improve bargaining power within their massive cloud ecosystems. Over time, that means less incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Over Q2, Nvidia said that just two of its customers made up roughly 39% of total revenue — likely these big U.S. tech firms — making it vulnerable if they shift workloads to in-house silicon or lower-cost suppliers. Chinese Internet Giants In China, companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Huawei are stepping up their AI chip efforts. Recent reports suggested that Alibaba plans to launch a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to power inference at scale using its own tech stack, and to secure a steady supply of semiconductors amid U.S. export restrictions. For now, Nvidia’s GPUs are still expected to form the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training workloads, but inference is likely to become the longer-term growth driver for the company. related Alibaba’s AI Chip A Big Deal? Beyond semiconductors, growing AI inference workloads will drive demand for supporting infrastructure. Fast, reliable, and intelligent networking will be critical to handle billions of requests daily. Companies like Arista Networks and Cisco are well-positioned to benefit, as ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects become essential for moving massive datasets between servers, GPUs, and cloud nodes in real time. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Wall Street Analysts Say We’re Not in an AI Bubble… Yet
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-analysts-ai-bubble-stock-market-11826943
Time Published: 2025-10-09T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
A spate of unusual deals within the AI ecosystem has recently fueled concern that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble, but some professional market watchers say this isn't 1999—at least not yet. OpenAI has vowed to spend hundreds of billions on Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips; in exchange, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI, and OpenAI will invest in AMD. Nvidia has invested in cloud providers Nebius (NBIS) and CoreWeave (CRWV), both of which buy its chips, and agreed with the latter to buy all of its unused computing capacity through 2032. These deals are just a few threads in a growing web of entanglements connecting chipmakers, cloud providers and AI model makers. Artificial intelligence excitement has been the main driver of stock market returns for the past three years, increasing the weight of big tech stocks in most portfolios. Until companies can demonstrate AI is contributing to the bottom line, the AI rally will depend on investors remaining optimistic about future returns. Skeptics warn these circular deals are evidence of an artificial intelligence bubble forming. They argue that Nvidia, through investments in the companies buying and renting its chips, is subsidizing the AI build-out, and artificially overstating the strength of AI demand in the process. But many on Wall Street disagree, including analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, who cast doubt on the bubble narrative in notes published Wednesday. “We believe the recent concerns re AI financing are highly overstated,” wrote BofA semiconductor equity analyst Vivek Arya, who doesn’t expect circular deals to account for more than 5% to 10% of the $5 trillion that is likely to be spent on AI by 2030. Though, it’s worth noting that by BofA’s calculation, OpenAI will have to spend between $500 and $600 billion on infrastructure as part of its Nvidia deal alone; add in its commitments to AMD and Oracle (ORCL), and the startup has agreed to spend about $1 trillion on cloud computing in the coming years. OpenAI’s centrality to the recent spate of deals has concerned some onlookers. The ChatGPT maker recently became the world’s most valuable startup, valued at $500 billion, and is in the process of becoming a for-profit company. Still, it anticipates burning through $115 billion on the road to profitability, which isn’t expected to happen until the end of this decade at the earliest. However, Arya notes that OpenAI, while a big player in the AI boom, is “only one of multiple (5-10) ecosystems including the four large US hyperscalers, Tesla/xAI, multiple sovereign buildouts (Middle East, Asia), 100+ neoclouds that do not require or have disclosed minimal vendor financing.” Skeptics have repeatedly pointed to the stock prices of the Magnificent Seven—Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—as evidence of a burgeoning bubble. The ten largest companies in the U.S., including all of the Mag 7, cumulatively account for a quarter of global equity market value. “This degree of concentration is, in our view, unsustainable,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Wednesday, “but this is not the same as saying that we are experiencing a bubble.” Goldman identifies three common components of financial bubbles: “rapidly rising asset prices, extreme valuations and rising significant systemic risks driven by increased leverage.” While the Mag 7 stocks have soared over the past three years, Goldman notes that their valuations remain modest compared with the lead up to the Dotcom bubble, in part because their stock prices reflect “powerful and sustained profit growth rather than excessive speculation about the future.” Another difference between then and now is that the companies fueling the AI boom with their spending have unusually strong balance sheets, cash flows and hugely profitable businesses not tied to AI. That has allowed them to fund their buildouts with existing revenue streams rather than equity and debt, which reduces the risk that a sudden shock to the AI ecosystem halts AI investment, forces a sharp revaluation of related assets, and ripples through the broader economy. Though, Goldman concedes that, while we’re not currently in a bubble, a few developing trends suggest we’re headed there. Big tech’s debt issuance picked up this year as cash reserves dwindled, suggesting systemic risk may be increasing. More companies have gone public to cash in on the AI frenzy, and investors have eaten the new offerings up. “The starting day premiums for new issues has reached an average of 30% in the US,” the highest since the Dotcom bubble, according to Goldman.

An AI chipmaker's stock extended its rally in the wake of a major artificial intelligence deal. Meanwhile, the latest salvo in an escalating competition between credit score providers weighed on one of the industry's big players. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to set fresh closing highs, bolstered by gains in the tech sector and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggesting the central bank could be on track toward more interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow was little changed. Find Investopedia's full daily market recap here. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares posted the day's best performance in the S&P 500 index with a nearly 12% jump, extending their winning streak following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI. A slew of analysts have raised their price targets for AMD this week, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to "buy" from "hold." Dell Technologies (DELL) shares surged 9.1%, after the server maker raised its outlook, citing strong demand driven by the buildout of AI infrastructure. CEO Michael Dell said the company's broad portfolio of tech products makes it well positioned to provide the compute, storage, and network capacity necessary to deploy AI at scale. Optimism around AI helped boost other companies with exposure to the burgeoning technology as well. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) rose about 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to keep growing. Equifax (EFX) announced it will provide its VantageScore 4.0 credit scores at a reduced price or free to customers, just days after Fair Isaac (FICO) said last week that it would offer its FICO credit scores directly to firms that provide credit reports to lenders, reducing reliance on Equifax and the other nationwide credit bureaus. Fair Isaac shares dropped nearly 10%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and reversing a portion of the gains posted after last week's announcement, while Equifax shares advanced close to 1%. Live Nation (LYV) shares fell 3.4% after the Ticketmaster parent announced a plan to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes maturing in 2031. The live entertainment company intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to redeem senior notes due in 2026, repay other debt, and for general corporate purposes.

Demand for artificial intelligence is booming and only just getting started, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially,” the CEO told CNBC in a televised interview Wednesday, adding that that he believes the AI boom is still in its early stages, leaving room for further growth. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were up 2% in recent trading, contributing to a rally in the tech sector. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom has seen its stock climb roughly 40% so far in 2025 as sales of its chips to power data centers surged and trade policy headwinds eased. Its move this year has helped propel Nvidia into the top spot as the world's most valuable public company, and made its CEO one of the richest people in the world. As a leading beneficiary of the AI boom, Nvidia has become something of a bellwether for the AI trade, with changes in its business and big moves in its stock able to influence broader markets. Shares of Nvidia partners such as Micron Technology (MU) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) also climbed Wednesday, adding to gains earlier in the week on a massive OpenAI deal with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also collaborates with the companies. AMD's deal came just weeks after Nvidia announced its own deal with OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a social media post Monday that the startup views its AMD deal as incremental to the ChatGPT maker's work with Nvidia, and that "the world needs much more compute." The move raised speculation more high-profile partnerships could be in the works, affecting a growing number of companies, with several Wall Street analysts likening the signal of strong demand for AI to a rising tide that lifts all boats. Huang said Wednesday that his only regret is not investing more in major AI players like OpenAI and CoreWeave (CRWV), an AI data center provider in which Nvidia holds a stake. The CEO also gave a shoutout to Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, saying Nvidia is investing in Musk's xAI and that “almost everything that Elon is part of, you really want to be part of as well." Shares of the EV maker, which were up about 1% Wednesday, have been on a tear in recent weeks, adding roughly a third of their value since the start of September as bulls have shifted more of their focus to the company's developments in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI.
