Title: China Prepares to Wreck US AI Industry
URL: https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2025/12/18/china-prepares-to-wreck-us-ai-industry/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T15:15:49Z
Full Content:
Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © JohanSjolander / E+ via Getty Images The math is simple. It starts with three facts. China has spent massive amounts to create very low-priced electricity at a rate several times the U.S. pace. It has built massive dams. The best example is the Motuo Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. No other nation could build a colossal project so fast. And China has extraordinary solar power supply. Do the large Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies pay for these? No. The central government largely does. China is a dictatorship, so things happen that way. Next, China creates a science project like the one America did when we built the atomic bomb. The nation’s best scientists all work on one project: chips that rival those made by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). Reuters calls it China’s Manhattan Project. The news service reports, “Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance.” Much of the tech seems to have been “stolen” from Western companies. Finally, China creates extremely advanced AI products, like those from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and OpenAI, which it then dumps into the market. The latest versions include DeepSeek-V3.2, which anyone in the public can use, and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, which is more for tech business operations. Chen Fang, a Chinese engineer who worked on the project, said, “People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough, but we came back much bigger,” according to VentureBeat. The Chinese could be lying, but experts with access to the DeepSeek products don’t think so. The Chinese can employ huge numbers of top experts to move forward even faster. There is no competition for talent like there is among America’s tech companies. No engineer in China is being paid $10 million to move from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). China won’t allow it. rodenkoff / iStock via Getty Images It takes three years to build a data center in the United States, especially for large hyperscale projects. Ask Elon Musk. U.S. data centers face a scarcity of electricity as builders attempt to bring data centers online quickly. Renewable energy has not scaled fast enough. This has forced America to return to coal generation. Environmental activists are trying to stop that. In the U.S. AI data center builders will need hundreds of billions of dollars to build out infrastructure. That capital has to be raised somewhere. Tech companies and financial players are cobbling it together. Companies like Microsoft and Meta do not have enough capital to cover these expenses themselves. Blue Owl Capital just walked away from helping to fund an Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) data center project. Money is fickle. Nearby residents and businesses oppose U.S. data centers. Data center power use can drive up electricity prices. The grid in some areas is too weak to supply the power. And politicians are starting to make electricity prices an issue. That can slow or kill data centers in some parts of the country. The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, “An escalating artificial intelligence race between China and the U.S. is drawing comparisons to the Cold War, and is likely to be just as consequential.” What happens to the valuation of Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other sector leaders if China starts to pull ahead? It is similar to what people worry about with an AI bubble.

Title: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-less-volatile-nvidia-in-2025-as-its-investor-base-diversified-bitwise
Time Published: 2025-12-18T03:40:52Z
Full Content:
Bitwise predicted Bitcoin's volatility will stay below Nvidia's in 2026, citing institutional adoption and ETFs as drivers of the asset’s maturation. Bitcoin’s volatility appears to be diminishing, with its movements in 2025 more subdued than those of Nvidia (NVDA), which Bitwise says indicates its investor base is diversifying. Bitwise said on Wednesday that Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to be less volatile than Nvidia in 2026 as “Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined over the past ten years.” It added that the shift signals a “derisking” of the asset as its investor base has diversified due to the emergence of institutional investment products. Bitcoin has seen a 68% price change from its lowest level this year, when it fell to $75,000 in April, to its highest level, which was the all-time high of $126,000 in early October. Comparatively, Nvidia has seen more volatility with a 120% price swing from a low of $94 in early April to a 2025 high of $207 in late October. Shares in the chip giant have also outperformed Bitcoin this year and are up 27% year-to-date. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has fallen 8% since the beginning of this year as crypto markets have decoupled from stocks. Bitwise also made several bullish predictions for the coming year, including a new all-time high for Bitcoin and a break of the four-year cycle. “Forces like the Bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles,” it stated. Related: Bitcoin decouples from stocks in second half of 2025 It predicted that more traditional institutions like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch would enter crypto, allocations to spot crypto exchange-traded funds would increase, and onchain building would accelerate in 2026. Finally, the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate, Bitwise said. It also predicted that crypto equities will outperform tech equities.

Title: Billionaire With 30 Years of 30% CAGR Gains Dumped Nvidia, Palantir, and Eli Lilly

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks? Almost every hedge fund and ETF that tried to sidestep these stocks ended up lagging the market. Remember, Druckenmiller isn’t just any hedge fund manager. He has managed to do well with his top holdings being almost devoid of any AI software companies, with the only AI bet being Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Let’s take a look at his moves with these top AI companies he does not hold. Stanley Druckenmiller started adding Nvidia shares in late 2022, very early on after ChatGPT’s release. He bought in Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023. But starting in Q3 2023, he started shedding his NVDA stake. He sold for 5 straight quarters as NVDA stock climbed higher and higher. He sold his last NVDA share in Q3 2024, when NVDA stock reached nearly $135. The stock is at $178 today, so did Druckenmiller make a massive mistake? Likely not. His top 3 holdings today have done a lot better than Nvidia, and taking profits in 2024 and shifting into those were anything but a miscalculation. Druckenmiller likely identified that NVDA stock became too expensive for his liking and didn’t have comparable upside potential vs. the stocks he moved into. Druckenmiller has had an on-and-off relationship with Palantir. He sold over half his shares in Q3 2021, then bought in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Again, he sold for over a year straight from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023. He took a break from the stock before buying in Q1 2024, buying 770,000 shares before selling 94.6% of his shares (728,000) in Q3 2024. He sold whatever PLTR stock he had left in Q1 2025, presumably near the peak price of ~$120, as Palantir’s rally accelerated aggressively. PLTR stock has climbed up to $187.75 today. While he did miss out on Palantir’s gains since Q1, he took out big profits from Palantir and piled into what he saw as “safer” stocks with bigger upside. It would be out of order for an investor like Druckenmiller to pay an earnings multiple deep in the triple digits for PLTR stock. And this paid off. The top 3 stocks in his portfolio have all performed better than or equal to PLTR stock over the past 6 months. His biggest holding outperformed PLTR by over 2x, with the second-biggest holding outperforming it by nearly 3x (it is up 100% in the past 6 months). The third holding is essentially neck and neck with Palantir’s 35.8% performance. Druckenmiller has quite a long history with Eli Lilly, but we’ll be looking into transactions in the past 5 years. He bought for 3 straight quarters, in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022. Druckenmiller then took profits for 6 straight quarters from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024 as he shed all his LLY stock holdings as the company did exceedingly well. He made a hefty profit doing so, only to re-enter in Q4 2024 as LLY stock dropped from the $900s range to the $700s range. Druckenmiller bought for 3 straight quarters but then ended up selling it all in Q3 2025, equalling a sale of 101,000 shares in total. Q3 had an average closing price of $744.53. LLY stock has since recovered and is at $1,054 as of this writing. Druckenmiller likely grew impatient with this drawn-out recovery and didn’t want to stay in the loop with the company, especially with the uncertainty surrounding drug prices as the government got involved. And again, while he missed out on gains on LLY, his top holdings have delivered much more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Amazon Eyes a Big Investment in OpenAI. Is This the Latest Sign of an AI Bubble?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-eyes-major-investment-in-openai-in-what-could-be-tech-next-big-circular-deal-amzn-11870952
Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:45:49Z
Full Content:
Amazon (AMZN) could be set to unveil an investment of $10 billion or more in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The companies are in talks for a deal that would see OpenAI buy some of Amazon's custom AI chips, and that would likely push OpenAI's valuation above $500 billion, according to a report from The Information and confirmed by CNBC. The talks reportedly started in October, after OpenAI completed its restructuring to a for-profit company with an agreement with Microsoft (MSFT), its largest investor, making it easier for OpenAI to seek funding from other companies. Amazon and OpenAI did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. A deal between Amazon and OpenAI would represent the latest in a string of big circular deals in the AI space, with major cloud and hardware providers investing in startups that also count them as suppliers. Such deals have exacerbated worries about an AI bubble, drawing parallels with the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. OpenAI has already signed over $1 trillion in agreements in recent months to buy chips and computing power. The startup struck massive chip deals Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and agreed to buy $38 billion in computing power from Amazon Web Services earlier this year. OpenAI's ChatGPT and other products don't currently generate enough revenue to cover those commitments, however, raising concerns the company may continue pulling in money from investors and lenders in the years to come before it turns a profit. Investors and analysts have grown increasingly skeptical in recent months of the growing number of circular deals within the AI industry, viewing them as unsustainable signals of a brewing AI bubble. Amazon shares were up less than 1% in recent trading, leaving them just 2% higher for the year so far and about 12% off their highs last month after a pullback in tech stocks in recent weeks.

Title: Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Bitcoin price held above $85,000, but weakening spot ETF flows and year-end volatility tested near-term bullish sentiment. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETF outflows and a 31% drawdown from the peak have raised doubts, but metrics indicate that institutional investors are not abandoning Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s shifting correlation with gold and steady volatility suggest price behavior remains intact despite the short-term market pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 3% on Tuesday after selling off to the $85,000 level on Monday. An uptick in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appears to show institutional investor demand softening since the Oct. 10 crash. This has tempered near-term upside expectations without signaling a broader shift in institutional positioning The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the largest daily withdrawal in over three weeks. The move fueled speculation that institutional investors might be reducing their exposure after the psychological $90,000 support level was breached. More importantly, Bitcoin is currently trading 31% below its all-time high of $126,219, a pullback that could signal the end of the bullish phase that extended into October. According to X user forcethehabit, Bitcoin’s decline does not represent a trend change, as interest rate cuts have been delayed and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced its balance sheet for longer than expected. The analysis also notes that institutional capital entered primarily through ETFs and corporate reserves, while rotation into riskier and more illiquid assets has yet to materialize. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold prices can be used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is viewed as an alternative store of value or simply a proxy for higher-risk assets. The digital gold narrative has been an important driver of Bitcoin’s upside throughout 2025. How Bitcoin tracks weekly moves in the gold price is more important than its 48% underperformance relative to gold since July. The 60-day correlation metric has oscillated between positive and negative since May, indicating little consistency between Bitcoin and gold price trends. Still, there is no doubt that Bitcoin traders are disappointed by the rejection that followed the loss of the $110,000 level. While such data may appear bearish at first glance, the 31% Bitcoin price drop since October had no impact on the correlation metric. This weakens the argument that institutional investors have shifted their risk perception. Bitcoin may still succeed as an independent and decentralized financial system, even as gold remains the world’s largest store of value, with an estimated $30 trillion market capitalization. It also seems premature to conclude that institutional money has abandoned Bitcoin based solely on a 10-week correction, especially since Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 7% over the past 18 months. Although that difference may appear modest, Bitcoin’s options risk profile closely matches Nvidia (NVDA US) and Broadcom (AVGO US), two of the world’s eight largest companies by market value. Bitcoin options’ implied volatility peaked at 53% in November, roughly in line with the current level for Tesla (TSLA US). When traders anticipate sharp price swings, this metric rises to reflect the higher premiums charged on call (buy) and put (sell) options. Market makers tend to reduce risk exposure when surprise price moves are more likely; however, this does not necessarily mean investors have turned bearish. There is currently no indication that institutional investors have abandoned expectations for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near term. Correlation and volatility metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price behavior has not materially changed following the 30% decline, meaning a few days of ETF net outflows should not be overemphasized. The effects of the recent liquidity injection from the US Fed have yet to be reflected in markets, making it premature to judge Bitcoin’s performance.

Professional money managers are feeling better about the stock market than they have in years. That may be cause for caution. The smart money is more bullish than at any time since July 2021, according to Bank of America’s December Global Fund Manager Survey, which showed optimism about the economic outlook at multi-year highs and cash levels at record lows. That may sound bullish—but the reading has pushed BofA’s "Bull & Bear Indicator" up to 7.9, a tenth of a point away from what the bank considers a "sell signal.” Why is that? The indicator is premised on the idea that market returns are driven by positioning, profit, and policy. The best time to buy risk assets, according to BofA, is when investor positioning is extremely bearish, profit expectations are recessionary, and policymakers are stimulating the economy—and the best time to exit is when positioning is bullish, profits are expected to skyrocketed, and policy is tightening. Investor sentiment is often a pivotal factor determining how the stock market responds to economic data, policy decisions, and corporate news. Excessive optimism can cause investors to overlook warning signs, while excessive pessimism can lead investors to overstate the significance of negative signals. Positioning is extremely bullish today, according to BofA. Fund managers' cash levels were at a record-low 3.3% when the survey was conducted between Dec. 5 and 11. Investors are more overweight stocks and commodities—a reflection of risk appetite—than any point since February 2022. Optimism about corporate profits is also running high. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed investors expect global earnings to increase over the next year, the largest share since August 2021. (A FactSet analysis estimates full-year 2025 earnings growth at above 12%, above the 10-year average.) Only 3% of those surveyed expect the global economy to fall into a recession over the next year. Policy, meanwhile, isn't looking too restrictive at present. Last week, a divided Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time this year, electing to support a weakening labor market despite signs inflation is sticking above its 2% target. Labor market data released Tuesday could bolster arguments to continue cutting rates early next year. The tax bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in July is also expected to boost economic growth next year. The Bull & Bear Indicator has flashed “sell” 16 times since 2002. More often than not, the S&P 500 rises in the three months after a sell signal. But historically, pullbacks have been larger than advances, and the index posted an average three-month return of -1.4% during those 16 periods. The indicator has sent two sell signals this year, in July and October. Both came about a month before stretches of exceptional volatility, but neither foretold a prolonged slump. The S&P 500 rose 7.5% in the three months that followed July’s signal. Since the alarm went off in October, the index is up about 1%. Some other sentiment measures are flashing some concern, but don't appear overly dramatic. CNN's Fear & Greed index was recently in a neutral range, less bearish than in recent weeks. And the weekly AAII survey of individual investor sentiment has lately tipped bullish or neutral after recovering from more downbeat readings last month. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge," remains in a zone generally denoting calm. Investors are increasingly concerned about the AI trade that’s defined the bull market of the past three years. Nearly 40% of investors said an AI bubble was the biggest risk facing markets next year. Nearly 20% said the biggest threat to stocks was a “disorderly rise in bond yields.” When asked what would be the most likely cause of distress in credit markets, nearly 30% of those surveyed said “AI hyperscaler capex,” the second-most common response. December’s survey marks the first time respondents have expressed any concern that AI spending could destabilize debt markets. Investor concerns about big tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure have been a headwind for tech stocks in recent months. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is down about 4% since hitting a record high in late October. On Monday, one-time darlings of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA) and Oracle (ORCL), were trading about 15% and 40% below their respective all-time highs.

Title: CoreWeave collapse sparks fears of cracks in AI infrastructure boom

CoreWeave (CRWV) has seen its share price fall more than 60% from its June record amid growing concerns that the AI infrastructure boom may have peaked. New details reported Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal highlight how fragile the buildout has become as operational delays collide with heavy leverage and tightening credit conditions. Investors are increasingly focused on two core risks with CRWV, according to the story. First, the company relies heavily on high interest debt to finance purchases of advanced AI chips from NVIDIA (NVDA). Second, the company depends on a small number of large customers, including OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), for the majority of its revenue. Some of CoreWeave’s problems stemmed from a basic construction setback, the story continued. Heavy rainstorms in North Texas delayed concrete pours at a major data center site, pushing back delivery timelines for computing capacity. Which shows even routine infrastructure bottlenecks can disrupt trillion dollar AI investment plans. Investor confidence weakened further in late October when CoreWeave’s proposed $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific collapsed. Core Scientific (CORZ), a former bitcoin miner turned data center landlord, rejected the deal after shareholders warned it would expose them to CoreWeave’s volatile share price and leveraged balance sheet. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO) have fallen by double digit percentages in the past week after recent third quarter earnings, both companies flagging slower timing for AI related spending. The crypto and AI mining spillover has occurred as a result of new diversified revenues for bitcoin miners. IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) have pivoted toward AI focused on high performance computing, signing customers including Microsoft. Each had previously surged over 500% this year, but both are down about 50% in recent weeks.. Another cause for concern, meanwhile, is that the bitcoin mining sector is increasingly relying on debt to fund expansion. CoreWeave shares have fallen a further 4% on Tuesday, trading below $70 for the first time since May.

The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all moved lower after November’s unemployment rate jumped to 4.6%, the highest level in four years, despite payrolls rising by 64,000.

Title: Crypto asset manager Bitwise says bitcoin will break its four-year cycle in 2026

Bitwise is telling clients to brace for a different kind of bitcoin BTC$88,161.34 market in 2026, arguing that the asset is maturing just as institutional money ramps up. The crypto asset manager said bitcoin’s long-watched four-year cycle is breaking down as halvings matter less, rates are expected to fall and leverage has been reined in after major liquidations in late 2025. "The forces that previously drove four-year cycles–the bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto’s leverage-fueled booms and busts—are significantly weaker than they’ve been in past cycles," Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO, said in the Monday blog post. The quadrennial halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50% by reducing the amount of new BTC miners receive as a reward for producing blocks. Combined with spot bitcoin ETF-fueled inflows and easier access on big brokerage platforms, Hougan expects those forces to help drive bitcoin to new all-time highs next year instead of a classic post-halving bust. Hougan also argued that bitcoin is no longer the outlier on risk many investors assume, noting that it has been less volatile than shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) in 2025 and that its swings have been trending lower for a decade as exchange-traded funds broaden ownership. At the same time, Hougan forecasts bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. stocks will fall as crypto-specific catalysts, regulation, adoption and product innovation take the wheel. Put together, Bitwise says, those trends could make 2026 a breakout year for bitcoin as a portfolio asset and pull in tens of billions of dollars in new institutional capital.
