Shares in electric utility Vistra (VST), the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 this year, hit another record high in early trading Thursday before losing ground to close lower. Wall Street analysts say that the utility’s nuclear assets place it in a position to capitalize on the significant energy requirements needed to power artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, such as data centers. In reports this week, Jefferies bumped its 12-month target on the stock to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley upwardly revised its target on the shares to $132 from $110, The AI utilities poster-child's stock price has surged three-fold since the start of the year, recently toppling AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) for the coveted position of the S&P 500’s top performing stock. Vistra hit a new high of $122.01 early Thursday, before retreating to finish 4.1% lower at $114.16. The stock had risen nearly 6% on Wednesday. Below, we take a closer look at Vistra's chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. After completing a 12-month trending move higher in May, Vistra shares traded within a symmetrical triangle for several months before staging a breakout above the pattern earlier this month. In recent weeks, the stock has continued to make an impulsive move higher on above-average volume, indicating strong buying conviction. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 80 threshold, but also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could give rise to near-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key levels on Vistra’s chart likely to attract attention. During retracements, the shares could initially retest the $107 level, where they may find support around the prominent late-May peak, which also marks the start of the symmetrical triangle. Further selling could see the shares fall to the $95 region, a location on the chart where investors may seek entry points near a trendline connecting comparable trading levels from May to July with the Sept. 19 pre-gap high. A deeper retracement in the shares could bring the $76 level into play. This area, sitting just below the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, would likely encounter buying interest near the April swing high and this month’s swing low. To project a price target for the stock’s current trending move, investors can use the measuring principle. To do this, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, we add $50 to $85, which forecasts an upside target of $135. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Micron Stock Pops as Sales and Guidance Impress

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher as the latest estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth slightly outpaced expectations in the second quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 added 0.4% on Thursday, printing a new all-time closing high. The Dow gained 0.6%, ending just below the level of Tuesday's record close. The Nasdaq was also up 0.6%, boosted by strength in the tech sector and solid gains from semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology (MU) shares secured Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, skyrocketing 14.7% after the memory chip maker beat revenue estimates and provided higher-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner nearly doubled its revenue from the year-ago period, with strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand helping underpin the strong sales growth. The firm's CEO said Micron's competitive positioning has reached its highest point in company history. Circuit board manufacturer Jabil (JBL) also reported strong quarterly results, topping sales and profit estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter. Like Micron, Jabil benefitted from strong AI demand during the quarter. The electronics manufacturer and Apple (AAPL) supplier also approved a $1 billion share repurchase plan and announced several cost-cutting initiatives. Jabil shares jumped 11.7% on Thursday. Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (EL) popped 10.0% higher following the announcement of an economic stimulus in China. The makeup maker generates around a third of its revenue from the Asia/Pacific region. However, in its most recent earnings report, Estée Lauder pointed to softness in the prestige beauty market in China as a key factor behind its 2% year-over-year decline in organic net sales. Any improvement in consumer sentiment that results from the stimulus could flow through to increased consumer spending and help drive a sales recovery for Estée Lauder in the key market. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged 12.2%, falling further than any other S&P 500 stock on Thursday. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the server and data storage provider's accounting practices. News of the DOJ probe follows a report published last month by activist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleging that Supermicro had engaged in accounting manipulation. Crude oil futures prices fell more than 3% amid reports that Saudi Arabia and other major producers are prepared to increase oil output in December, pressuring oil and gas stocks. Diamondback Energy (FANG) stock slid 6.5%, with news that insiders sold more than $2.3 billion worth of in the exploration and production company. Softness in natural gas prices also dragged on companies in that part of the energy sector. Shares of natural gas players Targa Resources (TRGP) and Oneok (OKE) were down around 5.9%.

Title: Volatile Month for Nvidia Stock Continues

The volatile month for shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued Thursday, as the stock surged in early trading only to slip into negative territory in the afternoon. The chip-maker’s shares, the year’s second-best performers in the S&P 500, rose more than 3% in the opening minutes of Thursday's session to trade near $127. That put them substantially above the roughly $119 at which they finished August, marking a recovery from September intraday lows near $101. In recent trading, however, the stock was down about 0.2% near $123, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also came off their earlier highs. The early move Thursday came as earnings from Micron (MU), a Nvidia partner, came in better than expected, sending chip stocks higher across the board. Micron pointed to "robust AI demand" as it issued a rosy revenue outlook. Bank of America analysts in a Thursday note said Micron’s results pointed to “a positive read-across” for Nvidia and other semi stocks. Wall Street analysts are still broadly bullish on Nvidia’s shares. Nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the stock have “buy” ratings on it, according to Visible Alpha data, while their mean price target of $152.52 represents a more than 20% premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week reported the conclusion of a planned sale of some $700 million in company stock.

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Title: Nvidia is back in the $3 trillion club — and Jensen Huang is $2 billion richer

Time Published: 2024-09-26T12:25:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is $2.3 billion richer thanks to a recent bump in Nvidia stock. Shares of the chip giant were up more than 2% in pre-market trading, after closing up about 2% at $123.51 apiece Wednesday. The uptick in the company’s stock brought its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, recovering ground from recent losses and bringing Nvidia back into the coveted club. Huang’s net worth now stands at $108 billion, making him the 13th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The CEO has a roughly 3% stake in Nvidia, which makes up the majority of his net worth. This current uptick in Nvidia stock may be driven by Bain’s annual technology report, released Wednesday, that predicted that the market for AI products could reach as much as almost $1 trillion by 2027. The consulting firm predicted that companies will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top — a positive signal to investors that mass funding of data centers and other critical AI infrastructure will remain strong. “If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said. Nvidia is one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, and has become a bellwether for excitement and demand for artificial intelligence. The company has seen its bottom line balloon on demand for chips that can power the AI boom, like its Blackwell and H200 chips. It was also the first chipmaker to reach a $2 trillion market cap in February, snagging the title of third-most valuable company in the world in March. It was briefly the most valuable company in the world this summer. But shares have been largely trending downward for the past month. Despite an earnings beat that saw record second-quarter revenue of $30 billion for fiscal year 2025 — up 122% from a year ago — Nvidia stock is still down 2% over the past month. Shares fell as much as 12.55% in the days following the its earnings report on Aug. 29. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156% so far this year. And compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200

Time Published: 2024-09-26T10:00:51Z

Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Ever since shares of Nvidia (NVDA) reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experienced some turbulence — but its market cap is still up over 150% so far this year. Nvidia’s shares were up 2.37% during mid-day trading Monday at $123.73 per share — down around 9% from its record-high close price of $135.58 on June 18, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156.86% so far this year, boosting its market cap just above $3 trillion and making it the third-most valuable company in the world. Compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the generative artificial intelligence boom due to high demand for its Hopper graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used for training and inferencing of some of the world’s most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, samples of Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, are shipping to customers, and the product is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. In August, reports that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws sent Nvidia’s shares down. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. However, despite reporting another record quarter that beat Wall Street’s expectations, Nvidia’s shares slipped in August, reflecting unimpressed investors who want more from the chipmaker.

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang concluded a planned sale of more than $700 million worth of company stock, regulatory filings Tuesday showed. Huang had previously announced his intention to sell as many as 6 million shares of Nvidia by the first quarter of 2025 under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC's) 10b5-1 rule, which allows insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks. He reached that limit months ahead of the plan's expiration, with the sale of 120,000 shares worth nearly $14.3 million, according to an SEC filing. The CEO still holds 75.4 million Nvidia shares directly and another 786 million through various trusts and a partnership, according to another filing. Shares of Nvidia closed nearly 4% higher at $120.87 Tuesday. They've more than doubled in value since the start of the year amid booming demand for the company's chips to support artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why

Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below. ANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025? TONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group. One of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction. AM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year? TR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks. And we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies. And then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. AM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that? TR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy. So the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily. Sure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street is rapidly pivoting away from gnashing its proverbial teeth over NVIDIA's peaking margins just a few weeks back to now rushing to incorporate the Blackwell production ramp-up in its collective bullish thesis, replete with expectations of a phenomenal surge in revenue from the GPU manufacturer's latest flagship product. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the rumors of a Blackwell architecture design flaw had dominated the narrative around NVIDIA throughout the summer, with analysts contending that the flaw's rectification would relegate the Blackwell production ramp-up to a predominantly calendar year 2025 phenomenon. Then, while announcing its earnings for the June-ending quarter, NVIDIA confirmed the rumors of a minor design flaw but noted that the shortcomings were rectified by making a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. Critically, the company announced at the time that it expected to start shipping Blackwell products in the December-ending quarter, with Hopper shipments also expected to increase. $NVDA Morgan Stanley says Hopper/Blackwell demand is strong - Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company - The Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) September 24, 2024 Now, Wall Street appears to be front-running NVIDIA's relatively cautious guidance by going a giant step forward. To wit, Morgan Stanley has now disclosed that it expects NVIDIA to ship 450,000 Blackwell chips in the December-ending quarter, earning ~$10 billion in revenue from this architecture alone: "Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for NVIDIA." While Morgan Stanley concedes that NVIDIA is still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, the Wall Street titan posits a qualifier that such issues are a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." What's more, Morgan Stanley still sees a very healthy demand profile for NVIDIA's H200 chips, courtesy of sovereign AI projects and smaller cloud service providers continuing to expand their capacity.

NVIDIA (NVDA) is experiencing strong demand for its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The investment bank said in a note Tuesday that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company. Morgan Stanley reports that Oracle recently announced plans to build a Zettascale AI supercluster powered by 131,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs, delivering 2.4 ZettaFLOPS of AI performance. Oracle’s request for more GPU supply has provided a boost to Nvidia’s outlook, as well as to its suppliers in the semiconductor industry. "At a recent event, Oracle reportedly requested more GPU supply, which was upbeat news for the Asia AI semi/system supply chain," wrote the bank. Morgan Stanley now expects TSMC’s CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity to increase to 80,000-90,000 wafers per month by 2025, up from a previous estimate of 70,000. In the near term, Nvidia’s Hopper GPU demand is said to remain strong, alleviating concerns about potential inventory risks. According to Morgan Stanley, the Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller cloud service providers and sovereign AI projects. Meanwhile, Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for Nvidia. Morgan Stanley also notes that while Nvidia is still resolving some technical challenges with its GB200 server racks, these issues are part of the normal debugging process for new product launches. Hon Hai, Nvidia’s assembly partner, is reportedly on track to begin shipments of the GB200 server rack by late Q4 2024. Morgan Stanley maintains a bullish outlook on Nvidia’s AI supply chain, favoring it over memory, PC, and cloud segments as Nvidia continues to capitalize on the growing demand for AI semiconductors.
