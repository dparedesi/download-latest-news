March 18, 2025 15:08 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a portfolio of technologies to supercharge humanoid robot development, including NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills. The other technologies include simulation frameworks and blueprints such as the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for generating synthetic data, as well as Newton, an open-source physics engine — under development with Google DeepMind and Disney Research — purpose-built for developing robots. Available now, GR00T N1 is the first of a family of fully customizable models that NVIDIA will pretrain and release to worldwide robotics developers — accelerating the transformation of industries challenged by global labor shortages estimated at more than 50 million people. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.” GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer CommunityThe GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2” is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making. Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements. System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform. GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as material handling, packaging and inspection. Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task. In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X Technologies. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.” Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics. NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research Focus on PhysicsNVIDIA announced a collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision. Built on the NVIDIA Warp framework, Newton will be optimized for robot learning and compatible with simulation frameworks such as Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo and NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab. Additionally, the three companies plan to enable Newton to use Disney’s physics engine. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are collaborating to develop MuJoCo-Warp, which is expected to accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x and will be available to developers through Google DeepMind’s MJX open-source library, as well as through Newton. Disney Research will be one of the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots, such as the expressive Star Wars-inspired BDX droids that joined Huang on stage during his GTC keynote. “The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” said Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before — and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” NVIDIA and Disney Research, along with Intrinsic, announced an additional collaboration to build OpenUSD pipelines and best practices for robotics data workflows. More Data to Advance Robotics Post-TrainingLarge, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day. Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation tasks from a small number of human demonstrations. Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11 hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%, compared with using only real data. To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on Hugging Face. AvailabilityNVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub. The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without extensive custom programming. The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.

March 18, 2025 14:17 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled NVIDIA Dynamo, an open-source inference software for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models in AI factories at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency. Efficiently orchestrating and coordinating AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs is crucial to ensuring that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize token revenue generation. As AI reasoning goes mainstream, every AI model will generate tens of thousands of tokens used to “think” with every prompt. Increasing inference performance while continually lowering the cost of inference accelerates growth and boosts revenue opportunities for service providers. NVIDIA Dynamo, the successor to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™, is new AI inference-serving software designed to maximize token revenue generation for AI factories deploying reasoning AI models. It orchestrates and accelerates inference communication across thousands of GPUs, and uses disaggregated serving to separate the processing and generation phases of large language models (LLMs) on different GPUs. This allows each phase to be optimized independently for its specific needs and ensures maximum GPU resource utilization. “Industries around the world are training AI models to think and learn in different ways, making them more sophisticated over time,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “To enable a future of custom reasoning AI, NVIDIA Dynamo helps serve these models at scale, driving cost savings and efficiencies across AI factories.” Using the same number of GPUs, Dynamo doubles the performance and revenue of AI factories serving Llama models on today’s NVIDIA Hopper™ platform. When running the DeepSeek-R1 model on a large cluster of GB200 NVL72 racks, NVIDIA Dynamo’s intelligent inference optimizations also boost the number of tokens generated by over 30x per GPU. To achieve these inference performance improvements, NVIDIA Dynamo incorporates features that enable it to increase throughput and reduce costs. It can dynamically add, remove and reallocate GPUs in response to fluctuating request volumes and types, as well as pinpoint specific GPUs in large clusters that can minimize response computations and route queries. It can also offload inference data to more affordable memory and storage devices and quickly retrieve them when needed, minimizing inference costs. NVIDIA Dynamo is fully open source and supports PyTorch, SGLang, NVIDIA TensorRT™-LLM and vLLM to allow enterprises, startups and researchers to develop and optimize ways to serve AI models across disaggregated inference. It will enable users to accelerate the adoption of AI inference, including at AWS, Cohere, CoreWeave, Dell, Fireworks, Google Cloud, Lambda, Meta, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, NetApp, OCI, Perplexity, Together AI and VAST. Inference Supercharged NVIDIA Dynamo maps the knowledge that inference systems hold in memory from serving prior requests — known as KV cache — across potentially thousands of GPUs. It then routes new inference requests to the GPUs that have the best knowledge match, avoiding costly recomputations and freeing up GPUs to respond to new incoming requests. “To handle hundreds of millions of requests monthly, we rely on NVIDIA GPUs and inference software to deliver the performance, reliability and scale our business and users demand,” said Denis Yarats, chief technology officer of Perplexity AI. “We look forward to leveraging Dynamo, with its enhanced distributed serving capabilities, to drive even more inference-serving efficiencies and meet the compute demands of new AI reasoning models.” Agentic AI AI provider Cohere is planning to power agentic AI capabilities in its Command series of models using NVIDIA Dynamo. “Scaling advanced AI models requires sophisticated multi-GPU scheduling, seamless coordination and low-latency communication libraries that transfer reasoning contexts seamlessly across memory and storage,” said Saurabh Baji, senior vice president of engineering at Cohere. “We expect NVIDIA Dynamo will help us deliver a premier user experience to our enterprise customers.” Disaggregated ServingThe NVIDIA Dynamo inference platform also supports disaggregated serving, which assigns the different computational phases of LLMs — including building an understanding of the user query and then generating the best response — to different GPUs. This approach is ideal for reasoning models like the new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family, which uses advanced inference techniques for improved contextual understanding and response generation. Disaggregated serving allows each phase to be fine-tuned and resourced independently, improving throughput and delivering faster responses to users. Together AI, the AI Acceleration Cloud, is looking to integrate its proprietary Together Inference Engine with NVIDIA Dynamo to enable seamless scaling of inference workloads across GPU nodes. This also lets Together AI dynamically address traffic bottlenecks at various stages of the model pipeline. “Scaling reasoning models cost effectively requires new advanced inference techniques, including disaggregated serving and context-aware routing,” said Ce Zhang, chief technology officer of Together AI. “Together AI provides industry-leading performance using our proprietary inference engine. The openness and modularity of NVIDIA Dynamo will allow us to seamlessly plug its components into our engine to serve more requests while optimizing resource utilization — maximizing our accelerated computing investment. We’re excited to leverage the platform’s breakthrough capabilities to cost-effectively bring open-source reasoning models to our users.” NVIDIA Dynamo Unpacked NVIDIA Dynamo includes four key innovations that reduce inference serving costs and improve user experience: NVIDIA Dynamo will be made available in NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and supported in a future release by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform with production-grade security, support and stability.

March 18, 2025 13:47 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled partnerships with industry leaders T-Mobile, MITRE, Cisco, ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, and Booz Allen Hamilton on the research and development of AI-native wireless network hardware, software and architecture for 6G. Next-generation wireless networks must be fundamentally integrated with AI to seamlessly connect hundreds of billions of phones, sensors, cameras, robots and autonomous vehicles. AI-native wireless networks will provide enhanced services for billions of users and set new standards in spectral efficiency — the rate at which data can be transmitted over a given bandwidth. They will also offer groundbreaking performance and resource utilization while creating new revenue streams for telecommunications companies. “Next-generation wireless networks will be revolutionary, and we have an unprecedented opportunity to ensure AI is woven in from the start,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Working with leaders in the field, we’re building an AI-enhanced 6G network that achieves extreme spectral efficiency.” Open Ecosystems Drive Innovation Research-driven breakthroughs harnessing the power of AI are necessary to maximize the performance and benefits of AI-native wireless networks. To drive innovation, NVIDIA is collaborating with telco and research leaders to develop an AI-native wireless network stack based on the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform, which provides software-defined radio access networks (RANs) on the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Developers across the globe are building AI-RAN as a precursor to AI-native 6G wireless networks. AI-RAN is a technology that brings AI and RAN workloads together on one platform and embeds AI into radio signal processing. To deliver enhanced spectral efficiency and lower operational complexity and costs, AI will be fully embedded into the network stack’s software and hosted over a unified accelerated infrastructure, capable of running both network and AI workloads. Also at the solution’s core will be end-to-end security and an open architecture to foster rapid innovation. T-Mobile and NVIDIA will expand their AI-RAN Innovation Center collaboration announced last year with the goal of providing additional research-based concepts for AI-native 6G network capabilities, working alongside these new industry collaborators. “This is an exciting next step to the AI-RAN Innovation Center efforts we began last September at our Capital Markets Day in partnership with NVIDIA,” Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. “Working with these additional industry leaders on research to natively integrate AI into the network as we begin the journey to 6G will enable the network performance, efficiency and scale to power the next generation of experiences that customers and businesses expect.” As the founding research partner, MITRE, a not-for-profit research and development organization, will research, prototype and contribute open, AI-driven services and applications, such as for agentic network orchestration and security, dynamic spectrum sharing and 6G-integrated sensing and communications. “MITRE is working with NVIDIA to help make AI-native 6G a reality,” said Mark Peters, president and CEO of MITRE. “By integrating AI into 6G in the beginning, we can solve a wide range of problems, from enhancing service delivery to unlocking required spectrum availability to fuel wireless growth. Through all of our collaborations with NVIDIA, we look forward to creating impact in 6G, AI, simulation, transportation and more.” Cisco plans to take a lead position in this collaboration as the provider of mobile core and network technologies and will tap into its existing service provider reach and expertise. “With 6G on the horizon, it’s critical for the industry to work together to build AI-native networks for the future,” said Chuck Robbins, chair and CEO of Cisco. “Cisco is at the forefront of developing secure infrastructure technology for AI, and we are proud to work with NVIDIA and the broader ecosystem to create an AI-enhanced network that improves performance, reliability and security for our customers.” ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., will deliver cutting-edge layer 2 and layer 3 software for distributed and centralized units of virtual RAN as part of the AI-native radio access stack. Tapping into decades of experience in large-scale mobile systems, ODC is pioneering next-generation AI-native 5G open RAN (ORAN), surpassing existing networks and seamlessly paving the way for 6G evolution. “The mobile industry has always taken advantage of advances in other technology fields, and today, no technology is more central than AI,” said Shaygan Kheradpir, chairman of the advisory board of ODC. “ODC is at the forefront of developing and deploying AI-native ORAN 2.0 networks, enabling service providers to on-ramp seamlessly from 5G to 6G by taking advantage of the vast AI ecosystem to redefine the future of connectivity.” As a leader in AI and cybersecurity to the federal government, Booz Allen will develop AI RAN algorithms and secure the AI-native 6G wireless platform. Its NextG lab will conduct functional, performance integration and security testing to ensure the resiliency and security of the platform against the most sophisticated adversaries. The company will lead field trials for advanced use cases such as autonomy and robotics. “The future of wireless communications starts today, and it’s all about AI,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman and CEO of Booz Allen. “Booz Allen has the technologies to make AI-native 6G networks a reality and revolutionize secure communications for an entirely new generation of intelligent platforms and applications.” Expanded Aerial Research PortfolioThese collaborations build on NVIDIA’s AI-RAN and 6G research ecosystem, supported by advancements in the NVIDIA Aerial™ research portfolio for developing, training, simulating and deploying groundbreaking AI-native wireless innovations. New additions to the NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio, also announced today, include the Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin Service, the Aerial Commercial Test Bed on NVIDIA MGX™, NVIDIA Sionna™ 1.0 — building on the open-source Sionna library, which has nearly 150,000 downloads since its launch in 2022 — and the Sionna Research Kit on the NVIDIA Jetson™ accelerated computing platform. The NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio serves over 2,000 members through the NVIDIA 6G Developer Program. Industry leaders and more than 150 higher-education and research institutions from the U.S. and around the world are harnessing the platform to accelerate 6G and AI-RAN innovation — paving the way for AI-native wireless networks.

Update: March 18, 2:37 p.m. ET: Huang announced the Vera Rubin GPU, which has twice the performance of its Grace chips with more memory and bandwidth. Rubin is expected in the second half of next year. Huang said the following Rubin Ultra is slated for the second half of 2027. Update: March 18, 2:35 p.m. ET: Huang says Blackwell Ultra NVL72 is coming in the second half of the year. Earlier in his keynote, Huang said Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell Ultra has one-and-a-half times more memory and more bandwidth. Update: March 18, 2:16 p.m. ET: Huang announced Nvidia Dynamo — “essentially the operating system of an AI factory” — for the future of AI agents. All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) chief executive Jensen Huang today as he shares more about the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he would discuss the chipmaker’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual GPU Technology Conference, also known as the GTC. Huang said the company has “some really exciting things to share” at the developer conference about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Huang said on the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.90%) said in a note last week that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts are also anticipating more information on Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology, and what the chipmaker’s long-term opportunities are in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said Nvidia is likely to talk more about its Project DIGITS personal AI supercomputer at the GTC, in comments shared with Quartz. “I’ve been saying for years that Nvidia GPU systems are ‘like the iPhone cycle, but better,’” Cook said. “What I mean is that enterprises will pay for the latest, better, and faster from Jensen, but they can still use their old hardware, too, because it’s all integrated and updated by CUDA software.” Cook said he thinks DIGITS will give smaller developers the ability to build their own physical AI models and agentic AI applications. Follow along for live updates as Huang’s keynote begins at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) and runs for approximately two hours.

Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.34%) stock was down by 1.76% at the market close on Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the GPU Technology Conference. The chipmaker’s shares closed at $119.53 each and are down 11% so far this year. During after-hours trading, the stock was slightly down by around 0.1%. All eyes will be on Huang’s keynote on Tuesday at the chipmaker’s annual developer conference, also known as the GTC, where he is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he will share more about the company’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation AI platform Vera Rubin, and other product plans at the conference. Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics, Huang said during the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Last week, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.90%) said in a note that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra” at the GTC. The analysts added that they anticipate Nvidia will focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. Jefferies (JEF+1.68%) analysts said in a note on Monday that they expect “the noise around CPO [co-packaged optics] to resurface over next few weeks” going into the GTC and the optical conference. Nvidia will likely discuss how the optical technology will be used in AI data centers, the analysts said. Meanwhile, some quantum computing stocks climbed on Monday ahead of the GTC’s first “Quantum Day” that will be held on Thursday. Quantum Computing (QUBT-2.55%) stock closed up by 13.12%, while D-Wave was up by 10.15% at the market close. Executives from quantum companies, including D-Wave, are expected to join Huang to discuss “what businesses should expect from quantum computing in the coming decades — mapping the path toward useful quantum applications,” Nvidia said. Shares of IonQ (IONQ+2.14%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-4.19%), both of which are also expected to join Huang at the GTC, were down by 0.28% and 0.53% respectively at the close.

Intel’s (INTC-6.96%) next chief executive isn’t formally due for work until Tuesday, but there’s already talk of an artificial intelligence-strategy revamp under Lip-Bu Tan. Investors sent the stock soaring on Monday after a Reuters report on the incoming CEO’s revitalization plans, which include pushing Intel into territory dominated by rivals Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) and ARM (ARM-0.92%). Intel stock jumped more than 8% to about $26 at 1:25 p.m. in New York. The rise over the past week has all but offset its loss in the market correction, and it’s now up almost 29% so far this year. Nvidia, which soared with the AI hype cycle, is down about 14% from January 1. In addition to boosting sales for Intel’s foundry business, which makes chips designed by other firms, Tan intends to make chips for AI servers, foundation models, and robotics, Reuters (TRI-0.93%) said, citing people familiar with the subject. Intel had neglected those markets, allowing ARM to rise in smartphone chips and Nvidia to dominate in AI. Last week, Tan told attendees of a company town hall that “tough decisions” were needed to revive Intel, possibly including further job cuts targeting middle managers. The company eliminated about 15,000 positions last year. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment on the story to Quartz. Tan will join Intel after running Cadence (CDNS+2.39%), which makes product-design software and hardware, for more than a decade. He was also a founding partner at VC firm Walden and sits on the boards of Credo Technology Group (CRDO+6.40%) and Schneider Electric.

Quantum Computing (QUBT-2.55%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-3.33%) saw shares surge on Monday ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.34%) GPU Technology Conference. Quantum Computing stock was up by around 15% during afternoon trading on Monday, while D-Wave shares were up by almost 8%. Executives from quantum companies, including D-Wave, are expected to join Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang at the chipmaker’s first “Quantum Day” on Thursday during its annual developers conference known as the GTC. Meanwhile, shares of IonQ (IONQ+2.14%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-4.19%), both of which are also expected to join Huang at the GTC, were down by more than 2% during afternoon trading. The quantum event will bring together experts and leaders in the field to discuss “what businesses should expect from quantum computing in the coming decades — mapping the path toward useful quantum applications,” Nvidia said. Huang will also make announcements about the chipmaker’s quantum computing advances that are “shortening the timeline to useful applications,” according to the company. Earlier this year, Huang said that useful quantum computers are still decades away during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show — tanking quantum computing stocks. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said at CES. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang added that he expects Nvidia to play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently unveiled quantum computing chips that they say show promise for the advent of large-scale quantum computing.

Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) will unveil more about its next artificial intelligence chips at its annual GPU Technology Conference this week, which some analysts think will be a “catalyst” for the company. After the chipmaker delivered another record quarter in February, Jefferies (JEF+1.68%) analysts said the developers conference, known as the GTC, will be “another positive catalyst to help solidify the performance advantages of Blackwell and lay a framework for continued AI spending, particularly on the inference side.” The company raised outlook for the fiscal first quarter on strong demand for its Blackwell AI platform, which it unveiled at last year’s GTC. Nvidia’s guidance confirmed that Big Tech’s big spending on AI will continue despite investor worries prompted by Chinese AI firm DeepSeek earlier this year, analysts said post-earnings. On Nvidia’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call, chief executive Jensen Huang said he will share more about the company’s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, its next-generation AI platform, Vera Rubin, and its plans for following products at the conference. Huang announced Blackwell Ultra and the Rubin platform during an appearance at COMPUTEX in Taiwan in June. He also said he will have “some really exciting things to share” about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. Nvidia stock was down by 1.76% at the market close on Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the GPU Technology Conference. Here’s what analysts are saying ahead of the GTC. Despite some investors being left unimpressed by Nvidia’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings beat, John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz that the company will “get the market excited about everything in the product pipeline,” at the GTC. Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, shared similar post-earnings sentiments, saying Nvidia’s “real story is its rapid cadence of innovation,” and that he expects “further product announcements [at the GTC] to build on today’s momentum.” Last week, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.90%) said in a note that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra.” The analysts added that they anticipate Nvidia will focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. Bank of America analysts added that they are looking forward to hearing more about Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology and its long-term opportunities in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Analysts at Jefferies said in a note on Monday that they expect “the noise around CPO [co-packaged optics] to resurface over next few weeks” going into the GTC and the optical conference. Nvidia will likely discuss how the optical technology will be used in AI data centers. “We’ll have our eyes on NVDA with expectations for CPO options on their new IB-based Quantum switch and Ethernet-based Spectrum switch,” Jefferies said in a note. “We view these more as proof of concept and expect limited volumes, but NVDA should use the platform and fervor to emphasize the benefit of their systems-based approach.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial indexes edged higher on Monday after February retail sales missed expectations, but didn’t show a collapse in consumer demand. The Nasdaq Composite edged lower. Futures had earlier pointed down after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he he was “not at all” worried about the stock market, calling corrections “healthy.” The market’s direction today may depend on whether the president says anything to intensify his trade war. “We will feel better about calling a stock market bottom when the market is no longer ‘tarrified’ by Trump’s tariff threats and actions,” Yardeni Research wrote in a note. “It might bottom after April 2, when Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs all around the world, if they lead to tariff-reduction negotiations.” U.S. retail sales rebounded in February, but by less than expected. The headline tally gained 0.2% from the prior month, compared with the StreetAccount consensus for a 0.7% increase. January’s month-on-month decline was revised to 1.2% from 0.5%. Ex-auto sales rose 0.3%, also less than expected. In other economic indicators, the Empire manufacturing index weakened much more than expected, to -20 for March. The NAHB housing market reading for this month unexpectedly declined, to 39 from 42 — consensus has been for 42.5. Business inventories rebounded by less than expected in January. Here are some stocks to watch today. Affirm (AFRM+8.12%) stock fell 12% after CNBC reported, citing people familiar, that rival Klarna will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for Walmart (WMT+0.76%) via the retailer’s OnePay fintech. Klarna isn’t yet publicly traded in the U.S. Baidu’s (BIDU-3.99%) American depositary receipts rose 5.7% after the Chinese search engine unveiled a new artificial intelligence model, Ernie X1, which works similarly to DeepSeek’s AI, Bloomberg reported. Baidu claimed the model excels in areas like daily dialogue, complex calculations and logical deduction. The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares gained 0.4%. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.25%) increased its stakes in Japanese trading firms Itochu Corp. (ITOCY+4.30%), Sumitomo Corp. (SSUMY+1.23%), Marubeni Corp. (MARUY+2.36%), Mitsubishi Corp. (MSBHF+4.83%) and Mitsui (MITSY+3.34%), the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a filing. Warren Buffett flagged this as a possibility last month. The stock gained 0.7%. Incyte (INCY+1.37%) stock fell more than 10% after the drugmaker reported clinical trial results for its oral treatment for the skin disease hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) that disappointed analysts. Netflix (NFLX+3.01%) rose 4.3% after MoffettNathanson upgraded its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral, saying the streaming service can monetize more than previously expected. Norwegian Cruise Line’s (NCLH+4.30%) shares advanced 4.4% after JPMorgan (JPM+2.36%) upgraded its recommendation for the stock to overweight from neutral on indications that cruise operators aren’t affected by a general pullback in consumer spending. Nvidia (NVDA+3.07%) edged lower as its much-anticipated developers conference starts today in San Jose. CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to give the keynote address on Tuesday.

Title: Trump's trade war tariffs are just part of a bigger fight

Time Published: 2025-03-17T09:00:00Z

In the first few weeks of his second administration, President Donald Trump has followed through — then pulled back — on tariff threats, sending stocks tumbling into correction territory. As Trump wields a trade war with U.S. allies such as Canada and Mexico, as well as adversaries like China, the U.S. could “wind up moving towards something that looks like autarky by default, where the only rational economic investment is in the United States,” Edward Fishman, a former State Department sanctions official, told Quartz. An autarky — where the U.S. economy would be self-sufficient — “is a bad future” of supply chain disruptions, higher prices, and slower economic growth, Fishman said. “Worst of all, you’ll have a higher risk of war, because if states can’t acquire resources and markets through open trade, they’re tempted to seize them by force,” he said. In his new book, Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare, Fishman examines how the U.S. has used sanctions, export controls, and tariffs as “weapons” in modern day economic warfare against rivals, with the technology and finance sectors at the center. His analysis reveals that while some economic tools have successfully advanced American interests, others — like tariffs without complementary strategies — often fall short of their intended goals and can even backfire. “I think that what’s at stake right now is not so much a trade war — it’s really a multi-domain economic war,” Fishman said. “Tariffs are just one tool, and probably not even the most aggressive tool that’s being used.” Fishman spoke with Quartz about the evolution of economic warfare between the U.S. and China, what’s different in Trump’s second term approach to tariffs, the strategic “chokepoints” each country controls, and how both nations might navigate this increasingly complex conflict. The number one key chokepoint that the U.S. controls is the financial system and the U.S. dollar, Fishman said, which is the backbone currency of the international financial system. The technology supply chain is another key chokepoint at the U.S.’s disposal — particularly semiconductors. “So far, we’ve primarily relied more on the technological chokepoint as opposed to financial, but it is very clear that China is very afraid of American financial sanctions, and Chinese banks are very worried about being sanctioned by the Treasury Department,” Fishman said. China’s key chokepoint, meanwhile, is the industrial economy, such as critical minerals and rare earths that go into chips and ammunition. In December, China banned exports of the critical minerals gallium, germanium, and antimony to the U.S. “China dominates these areas, not just because they have the resources on their territory — a lot of times the actual mining is done in other countries — but they really dominate the processing step for critical minerals,” Fishman said. The country also dominates in finished products such as batteries, and sophisticated goods including electric vehicles. In the years since Trump’s first administration, China has been preparing, Fishman said, by building its own economic arsenal to retaliate against the U.S. — but not only with tariffs. China is responding asymmetrically instead — imposing sanctions on U.S. firms such as Calvin Klein-owner (PVH-0.94%) PVH and defense drone manufacturer Skydio. It has also opened regulatory investigations into U.S. companies such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.07%) and Alphabet (GOOGL+2.37%) — a direct retaliation for Trump’s tariffs, according to Fishman. “As they [China] retaliate more, you’ll have a real risk of an escalatory spiral — a tit-for-tat, multi-domain economic war with China,” Fishman said, adding that it will be on Trump and Xi to figure out a more sustainable economic relationship. “It seems like the thing he [Trump] cares most about is the trade deficit,” Fishman said. Currently, the U.S. and China have around $600 billion in bilateral trade — about $400 billion of which is U.S. imports from China. During his first administration, Trump wanted to close the trade deficit by selling more to China — an approach Fishman said would never work. “The idea that you could triple American exports to China is pretty unlikely — especially if at the same time, you’re going to tell the most powerful and high technology U.S. companies that they can’t export things to China,” Fishman said. On top of that, many U.S. companies such as Google and Meta (META+0.31%) don’t have access to the Chinese market because the Chinese government has banned them. “If he truly wants to close the trade deficit, the only viable way to do that isn’t exporting more to China, it’s by importing less from China,” Fishman said. “In some ways, tariffs will help with that, but the challenge with tariffs alone is they won’t necessarily stop our reliance on China — they may just divert trade elsewhere.” If the Trump administration wants to really reduce U.S. reliance on China, tariffs are not enough, according to Fishman. Economic pressure alone won’t achieve Trump’s goals — any effective strategy requires both punitive measures and positive incentives to reshape global supply chains. While tariffs can discourage certain imports, they don’t automatically create new manufacturing capacity or alternative supply sources for American businesses. The U.S. would need to invest in new supply chain relationships, also known as friend-shoring, and deeply integrate the economy with those of ally countries — a move that would require proactive trade agreements. “The challenge right now is that Trump is really going hard on threats and tariffs, and he’s not doing as much when it comes to using trade incentives,” he said. The current age of competing with sanctions, tariffs, and export controls predates Trump, and will continue after him, Fishman said. Currently, the U.S. “tools” for economic warfare are spread across multiple government agencies, such as the State Department and the Treasury Department, which each have different authorities and perspectives. Fishman’s suggestion is to dedicate one federal agency that is responsible for carrying out economic warfare. “We need to have a disciplined strategic process that looks a lot like how the Pentagon prepares for and fights wars,” Fishman said. “We need to recruit and train professional individuals who can develop the right tools of economic warfare, plan for the economic wars of tomorrow and practice them, and have strategic options ready for different contingencies.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The women scientists Nvidia has named its chips after

All eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA) annual GPU Technology Conference next week where it will unveil its next-generation artificial intelligence chip platform, Vera Rubin. The highly-anticipated AI chip platform follows Nvidia’s practice of naming its GPU architectures after (mostly) women scientists. Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, was named after David Blackwell — the first Black American to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. Here are the women scientists Nvidia has named its AI chips after. Vera Rubin was an astronomer who contributed to research on dark matter. After observing more than 60 galaxies, Rubin and her colleague Kent Ford discovered evidence of dark matter in the universe. In 1965, Rubin became the first woman scientist on staff at the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C. She died in 2016. Nvidia named its Hopper architecture after Grace Hopper, a U.S. naval officer who contributed to developments in automatic programming, coding languages, and other software. During World War II, Hopper worked on the Mark I general-purpose computer. Hopper died in 1992. The Ada GPU architecture, which was designed for gaming graphics and AI, was named after Ada Lovelace. Lovelace was an 1800s mathematician who is considered “the first programmer” because she hypothesized that computers could be used for more than calculating numbers. The U.S. Department of Defense named a computer language “Ada” after her in 1979.

Title: Facts About The Stock Corrections, Tariffs, And Consumer Confidence

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday. So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture. So, there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Fed meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

All eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.18%) GPU Technology Conference this week, where the company is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said he will share more about the upcoming Blackwell Ultra AI chip, Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual conference, known as the GTC, during the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. On the earnings call, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” according to Huang. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.62%) said in a note on Wednesday that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts also anticipate the chipmaker to share more information on its next-generation networking technology, and long-term opportunities in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Read more: What analysts are saying about Nvidia GTC In January, Nvidia announced that it would host its first Quantum Day at the GTC, and have executives from D-Wave and Rigetti (RGTI-3.56%) “discuss where quantum computing is headed.” The company added that it will unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications.” The same month, quantum computing stocks tanked after Huang expressed doubts over the technology’s near-term potential during the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, saying useful quantum computers are likely decades away. Jefferies (JEF+1.64%) analysts said in a Thursday note that they expect Nvidia’s product announcements at the GTC “to be another positive catalyst” for the company “as investors move past supply-chain noise and can once again get excited about the technology roadmap.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Federal Reserve will probably keep interest rates steady at its two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday. But investors will be laser-focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference for any fresh remarks about tariffs and the central bank’s future course. “I don’t think Powell will be committal on anything” and will probably repeat the Fed will remain data dependent, said Jason DeLorenzo, whose Ad Deum Funds tracks options trading. “I expect a rally during the news conference, so long as Powell doesn’t say anything surprising, as hedges get unwound.” That expectation could be upended if the Fed chair takes the opportunity to say something fresh and substantial or if President Donald Trump says something that unnerves investors. Here’s what else investors will be watching. U.S. retail sales may have rebounded in February, according to StreetAccount consensus estimates. Expectations are for a 0.7% rise in the headline tally from January, when they’d fallen 0.9%. Stripping out auto sales, the gain may be 0.5%, compared with a 0.4% decline. The numbers are due at 8:30 a.m. EDT. More economic indicators: business inventories, homebuilder confidence index, Empire State manufacturing index Nvidia (NVDA+3.07%) CEO Jensen Huang gives the keynote address at his company’s AI conference in San Jose, California.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

Title: An AI stock picker that beat the S&P 500 last year is dumping tech stocks — but holding on to these Magnificent 7 firms

Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that. Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR). But this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way. AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider. "In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month," Tam said. A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date. "Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech," Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now. Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS). The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%). Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock. "We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development," Tam said. As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker. "We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot," Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm. AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick. The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

Title: Bitcoin outperforms tech stocks as US market opens to sea of green

Bitcoin's strength persists as tech stocks surge and dollar weakens. The US stock market has opened to a sea of green on seemingly minor news. While President Trump’s call to Vladamir Putin to end the war in Ukraine could be seen as a potential ease to global tensions, the market appears to be responding primarily to a lack of trade war advancements. Markets love certainty and direction, with tariff volatility coming out of the US, Europe, and Canada; this Friday, traders seem optimistic that a reprieve is coming. The DXY dropped just 0.08% moments ago, which is correlated with Bitcoin’s decline of almost 1%. However, Bitcoin has held firm over the last day, outperforming the US market. Against a weakening US dollar, down 0.12% over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin’s relative strength is accentuated by a roughly 2% gain. It is significantly surpassing the Nasdaq, which is up 0.61% over the same timeframe. Yet Bitcoin remains range-bound, with prices fluctuating within a channel between $79,000 and $84,000. Tech equities broadly rallied at the market open, led by Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which gained 6.32%, and NVIDIA (NVDA), which went up 3.33%. Yet Bitcoin-linked investment vehicles, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), showed a parallel upward trajectory, reflecting broader investor interest in digital assets. Bitcoin’s positive divergence amid a mixed economic backdrop, characterized by modest dollar weakness and tech equity strength, indicates sustained market demand.
