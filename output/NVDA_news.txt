October 28, 2025 13:51 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced America’s first AI-native wireless stack for 6G, including new applications to advance next-generation wireless technology, in collaboration with industry-leading partners Booz Allen, Cisco, MITRE, ODC and T-Mobile. As AI moves beyond smartphones to cameras, augmented-reality glasses, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices, wireless networks face mounting demand to support billions of connections at unprecedented scale and efficiency. To meet this challenge and support transformative technologies like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) — a critical sensing capability for connecting physical and digital environments — wireless networks must become AI-native across hardware, software and architecture. AI-native networks enable spectrum — radio frequencies used to transmit wireless signals — to be used as efficiently as possible. AI-RAN architecture is at the heart of next-generation wireless communications, combining connectivity, computing and sensing via a common platform with software-defined applications. “6G is being built from the ground up with AI at its core — unlocking extreme spectral efficiency, massive connectivity and breakthrough applications,” said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. “Working with industry leaders, we’ve created an AI-native wireless stack with advanced features to ensure that America will play an instrumental role in the journey to 6G.” First Made-in-America AI-Native Wireless Stack at NVIDIAJust six months since starting the AI-WIN project, NVIDIA and its partners built a complete AI-native wireless stack, performed the first user-to-user phone call over the network and developed groundbreaking 6G applications at NVIDIA’s campus in Santa Clara, California. The system combines the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform with 5G RAN software from ODC, user plane function and 5G core software from Cisco, and specialized 6G applications from MITRE and Booz Allen. Cisco is accelerating secure network connectivity for the AI era through the AI-WIN initiative, helping build the foundation to enable physical AI and integrated sensing with exceptional efficiency and security. “Through this partnership, we are pioneering the future of intelligent, secure connectivity — where AI is infused into the fabric of mobile networks and services,” said Masum Mir, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Provider Mobility. “Together, we are harnessing AI to enable networks that sense, learn and act in real time, empowering service providers to deliver high-value business and consumer services in the AI era.” Cerberus ODC’s commercial, fully software-defined 5G RAN, powered by NVIDIA AI Aerial, is setting new benchmarks by enabling simultaneous RAN and AI workloads for mission-critical enterprise applications, while outperforming legacy RAN systems with 7x greater cell capacity and 3.5x higher power efficiency. Breakthrough Applications Drive 6G StandardsAs part of the collaboration, NVIDIA and Booz Allen developed a first-of-its-kind multimodal ISAC application, fusing camera vision and radio-frequency sensing to enable precise detection and tracking of objects even in low-visibility conditions. Camera vision can be used to spot a moving object but cannot track its path or detect it when there is an obstruction. Radio-frequency sensors, however, can reveal an object’s location, velocity and distance, and sense its presence without visible light. Using camera vision and radio-frequency data, the new ISAC application delivers enhanced spatial awareness in real time, enabling powerful use cases in public safety, industrial monitoring and national security, where traditional single-modality sensing may fall short. AI-powered spectrum agility, a new application built by MITRE, manages wireless spectrum allocation within a cell site in real time so users can experience seamless connectivity and operators can benefit from dramatic improvements in spectral efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches that shut down entire network bands when interfering systems are detected, this application uses AI to target and block only the affected frequencies without interrupting consumer services. This delivers an orders-of-magnitude improvement in spectral efficiency and utilization compared with existing methods and addresses persistent challenges with spectrum management and operations. At NVIDIA GTC, Washington D.C., Booz Allen showcased its AI-powered spectrum sensing R.AI.DIO application to detect and classify any type of interference, including malicious signal jammers and unauthorized network users, in real time. This enables operators to immediately respond to threats and automatically mitigate issues to protect network integrity. NVIDIA AI Aerial software libraries make these early 6G applications possible, and new AI- and neural network-based model integrations boost performance and efficiency. In addition, the new NVIDIA Aerial Framework provides modular, programmable pipelines to seamlessly integrate third-party applications into the AI-RAN stack. Application programming interfaces that are part of the framework enable these applications to access real-time physical-layer data — the base form of data in a radio signal processing pipeline — enhancing further training and reinforcement learning for AI models on the fly. AI-native wireless networks provide the path to telecom’s major paradigm shift from 5G to 6G, enabling extremely efficient edge AI inference and sensing capabilities to serve hundreds of billions of network connections and raise revenue for operators.

October 28, 2025 13:40 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced that the nation’s leading manufacturers, industrial software developers and robotics companies are using NVIDIA Omniverse™ technologies to build state-of-the-art robotic factories and new autonomous collaborative robots to help overcome labor shortages and drive American reindustrialization. “AI is transforming the world’s factories into intelligent thinking machines — the engines of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together with American’s manufacturing leaders, we’re building physical AI, Omniverse digital twins and collaborative robots that will drive productivity, resilience and competitiveness across the U.S. industrial base.” The Operating System for the Industrial AI EraNVIDIA announced that it is expanding its “Mega” NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for simulating robot fleets to include technologies for designing and simulating factory digital twins. Siemens is the first company to develop digital twin software that supports the Mega Omniverse Blueprint. Currently in beta testing, the new industrial technology stack will be part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform. It will help engineers design and operate large-scale digital twins of factories that bring together realistic 3D models with live operational data. Built for the AI era, this technology stack enables comprehensive simulation, optimization and real-time performance monitoring that can help design smarter and more efficient factories, products and data centers. FANUC and Foxconn Fii are among the first robot manufacturers to support 3D, OpenUSD-based digital twins of their robots to make it easy for manufacturers to drag and drop equipment into their digital twins. In his NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C., keynote address, Huang showcased how Foxconn is using the new Omniverse technologies to design, simulate and optimize its new 242,287-square-foot facility in Houston, Texas, for manufacturing NVIDIA AI infrastructure systems. America’s Leaders Build AI-Driven Factories to Accelerate ManufacturingIn 2025, $1.2 trillion in investments toward building out U.S. production capacity was announced — led by electronics providers, pharmaceutical companies and semiconductor manufacturers. The nation’s leading companies are relying on applications from independent software vendors and Omniverse libraries to build robotic factories that can power this wave of industrialization, using physical AI and simulation to accelerate manufacturing.

October 28, 2025 12:29 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C. -- NVIDIA and Nokia today announced a strategic partnership to add NVIDIA-powered, commercial-grade AI-RAN products to Nokia’s industry-leading RAN portfolio, enabling communication service providers to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on NVIDIA platforms. NVIDIA will also invest $1 billion in Nokia at a subscription price of $6.01 per share. The investment is subject to customary closing conditions. The partnership marks the beginning of the AI-native wireless era, providing the foundation to support AI-powered consumer experiences and enterprise services at the edge. In addition, the partnership addresses the fast-growing AI-RAN market, representing a significant opportunity within the RAN market that is expected to exceed a cumulative $200 billion by 2030, according to analyst firm Omdia1. Together, NVIDIA and Nokia are also laying the strategic infrastructure and opening up a new high-growth frontier for telecom providers by delivering distributed edge AI inferencing at scale. T-Mobile U.S. will collaborate with Nokia and NVIDIA to drive and test AI-RAN technologies as a part of the 6G innovation and development process, reinforcing its global leadership in driving wireless innovation. Trials are expected to begin in 2026, focused on field validation of performance and efficiency gains for customers. The move will enable massive improvements in performance and efficiency, helping ensure that consumers using generative, agentic and physical AI applications on their devices will have seamless network experiences. It will also support future AI-native devices, such as drones or augmented- and virtual-reality glasses, while being ready for 6G applications such as integrated sensing and communications. “Telecommunications is a critical national infrastructure — the digital nervous system of our economy and security,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Built on NVIDIA CUDA and AI, AI-RAN will revolutionize telecommunications — a generational platform shift that empowers the United States to regain global leadership in this vital infrastructure technology. Together with Nokia and America’s telecom ecosystem, we’re igniting this revolution, equipping operators to build intelligent, adaptive networks that will define the next generation of global connectivity.” “The next leap in telecom isn’t just from 5G to 6G — it’s a fundamental redesign of the network to deliver AI-powered connectivity, capable of processing intelligence from the data center all the way to the edge. Our partnership with NVIDIA, and their investment in Nokia, will accelerate AI-RAN innovation to put an AI data center into everyone’s pocket,” said Justin Hotard, President and CEO of Nokia. “We’re proud to drive this industry transformation with NVIDIA, Dell Technologies, and T-Mobile U.S., our first AI-RAN deployments in T-Mobile’s network will ensure America leads in the advanced connectivity that AI needs.” Supporting Exponential Growth in AI traffic Growth in AI traffic is exploding. For example, almost 50% of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly active users access the site via mobile devices, and its monthly mobile app downloads exceed 40 million. With Nokia and NVIDIA-powered AI-RAN systems, mobile operators can improve performance and efficiency as well as enhance network experiences for future generative and agentic AI applications and experiences. They will be able to introduce new AI services for 6G with the same infrastructure, powering billions of new connections for drones, cars, robots and augmented- and virtual-reality glasses that demand connectivity, computing and sensing at the edge. Seamless Transition to AI-Native Networks NVIDIA is introducing Aerial RAN Computer Pro (ARC-Pro), a 6G-ready accelerated computing platform that combines connectivity, computing and sensing capabilities, enabling telcos to move from 5G-Advanced to 6G through software upgrades. The NVIDIA ARC-Pro reference design is available for manufacturers and network equipment providers to build commercial-off-the-shelf-based or proprietary AI-RAN products, supporting both new buildouts and expansions to existing base stations. Nokia will accelerate the availability of its 5G and 6G RAN software on the NVIDIA CUDA® platform and expand its RAN portfolio by embedding NVIDIA ARC-Pro at the heart of the new AI-RAN solution. This partnership will enable Nokia’s mobile network customers to transition seamlessly from today’s RAN networks to future AI-RAN networks. Nokia’s unique anyRAN approach simplifies the introduction of the ARC-Pro platform by establishing software-defined RAN evolution for both Cloud RAN and purpose-built RAN. AirScale baseband is a modular architecture in which new cards can coexist with previously deployed cards. Nokia aims to expand and evolve its AirScale baseband into the 5G-Advanced and 6G era with new AI-RAN capabilities. Dell Technologies is driving innovation in Nokia’s AI-RAN solution with its state-of-the-art Dell PowerEdge servers. Engineered for seamless scalability, these servers enable no-touch software upgrades and low-touch silicon upgrades, ensuring a smooth evolution from 5G to 5G-Advanced and 6G. With their robust, high-performance infrastructure, Dell PowerEdge servers are the ultimate compute platform for operators deploying AI-RAN solutions. Future-Proofed for 6G Nokia and NVIDIA’s AI-RAN platform unifies AI and radio access workloads on a software-defined, accelerated infrastructure, boosting performance, efficiency and monetization while enabling a smooth, cost-effective path to 6G. New capabilities are added through software updates, future-proofing investments for 6G and beyond, while enabling rapid innovation cycles at the pace of AI. It serves growing generative AI and agentic AI traffic on the same sites as RAN functions, applying AI algorithms to improve spectral and energy efficiency, as well as overall network performance, and by tapping into underutilized RAN assets to host edge AI services and maximize return on investment. “With America’s best network, T-Mobile remains committed to advancing next-generation technologies that redefine the customer experience,” said John Saw, president of technology and chief technology officer at T-Mobile. “Our collaboration with industry leaders Nokia and NVIDIA marks an important step toward shaping the future of connectivity as we develop the innovations that will power the 6G era. Building on the foundation established by the AI-RAN Innovation Center in 2024, this strategic initiative reinforces T-Mobile’s leadership in driving the U.S. wireless industry forward. Beginning in 2026, T-Mobile will conduct field evaluations and testing of advanced AI-RAN technologies to ensure they meet the evolving needs of our customers as we move toward 6G.” “The telecommunications industry owns the most valuable real estate for AI — the edge, where data is created,” said Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies. “This AI-RAN collaboration with Nokia and NVIDIA makes that potential real. We’ve built some of the world’s largest AI clusters with 100,000+ GPUs. Now we’re applying that expertise to distribute intelligence across millions of edge nodes. The operators who modernize their infrastructure today won’t just carry AI traffic — they’ll be the distributed AI grid factories that process it at the source, where latency matters and data sovereignty is critical.” Additional AI Networking Solutions Cooperation Nokia and NVIDIA will also collaborate on AI networking solutions, including data center switching with Nokia’s SR Linux software for the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform and the application of Nokia’s telemetry and fabric management platform on NVIDIA AI infrastructure. The companies will also explore the use of Nokia’s optical technologies and capabilities as part of future NVIDIA AI infrastructure architecture.

Update font size. Reset Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion market value in early trading on Tuesday, becoming the third Big Tech giant to hit this milestone. Strong demand for its latest iPhone models eased concerns about the company’s lagging AI progress, which critics attribute to a lack of visionary leadership. Reuters: ‎ Apple’s shares have gained about 13% since the new launches on September 9, in a remarkable turnaround that pushed the stock into positive territory for the first time this year. Brokerage Evercore ISI expects the strong demand for Apple’s latest iPhones to help it surpass market expectations for the three-month period ending in September and issue upbeat forecasts for the quarter ending in December. Apple is the third company to hit the $4 trillion mark after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia currently tops the table with a market value of more than $4.5 trillion. Apple’s cautious approach to AI had fueled concerns it could lose out on what could be the industry’s biggest growth catalyst in decades. Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while an AI upgrade to its voice assistant Siri has been delayed until next year. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s market cap has fallen back under $4 trillion in subsequent trading.

Title: Nvidia Will Fall Apart, According to This Analyst

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 A recent analysis shows that only one Wall Street analyst rates Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a Sell. Bloomberg reports that 73 analysts have a Buy rating on the stock and another six rate it Hold. This optimism is astonishing for a stock that is up 1,426% in the past five years. The news service reports that the Nvidia bear, Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, believes “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” His belief is based on the fact that Nvidia has a small number of huge customers that make up much of its revenue. These include Microsoft and Amazon, which say they will spend tens of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence this year. That primarily includes the cost of infrastructure, which includes electricity, and the cost of Nvidia chips. solarseven / iStock via Getty Images Goldberg’s view of the future has legs. Consider what has become known as “round-tripping” of cash. Nvidia invests in a company and then gets much of that investment back in chip sales. For example, Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the industry leader. Some of that money is “recycled” to Nvidia in chip sales, AKA revenue. One decision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could stop this questionable practice. Nvidia’s top line could take a massive hit. Another argument is that AI will never be a huge commercial success. The greatest technology advance in history may produce little money. Most AI users today rely on free versions. For AI to be considered a success, companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon must make hundreds of billions of dollars on enterprise applications. It is much too early in AI’s evolution to say whether that will happen. Next, Nvidia has competition, although its bulls think those rivals will always be small. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) leads these competitors. Its stock is up 119% this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced an AI chip, and its stock rose 20% in a day. For Nvidia to keep its valuation, it must stay well ahead of these companies in revenue. Finally, there is the Chinese market. By most estimates, it is the only country close to the United States in AI development. China has blocked Nvidia chip sales, saying it has its own advanced chips, which can be improved. If Nvidia stays locked out of the market, it loses out on potentially huge sales. If Chinese chips become truly competitive, they could be direct competition to Nvidia beyond China and the U.S. Goldberg has a case.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/the-reason-caterpillar-s-stock-is-priced-for-perfection-and-beating-nvidia-in-2025-11836557

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

Title: Qualcomm Stock Is Soaring Today After Chipmaker Makes a Big AI Move

Full Content:
Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

AMD stock is on a record-breaking streak. It’s trading around $253 after a 6.5% surge Friday, up nearly 90% this year—thanks to major AI partnerships that have Wall Street buzzing. A game-changing OpenAI chip deal on October 6 sparked a 34% single-day jump. Then came an Oracle GPU order and an IBM quantum breakthrough, lifting AMD shares another 7–8%. Now, analysts are racing to catch up. Bank of America lifted its target to $300, HSBC to $310, and others into the high $200s.

Stock futures are pointing to a sharply higher open this morning after major indexes closed last week at record highs; investor sentiment is getting a boost after President Donald Trump said he was optimistic the U.S. would reach a trade deal with China and address ownership of social media app TikTok; Avidity Biosciences (RNA) shares are surging after Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis (NVS) said it would acquire the biotechnology firm; and U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies are soaring after President Javier Milei’s political party posted victories in legislative elections there. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning amid optimism about an apparent easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, while investors prepare for an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a flurry of earnings reports from major technology companies later in the week. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session at record highs after each gained about 2% last week following a mild inflation report that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate on Wednesday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% recently, while those linked to the the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading at $115,400, up from a low over the weekend around $111,000. Gold futures were down 2.6% at $4,030 an ounce, as the precious metal continues to step back from recent highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, rose to 4.02% from 4.00% at Friday's close. Crude oil futures were down slightly at around $61.40 after jumping last week following a move by the U.S. to place sanctions on Russian oil firms. President Donald Trump said early Monday that the U.S. is positioned to reach a trade deal with China, as the the president gets set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. "I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,” Trump said. U.S. and Chinese negotiators over the weekend reached a framework for a trade deal that could result in a reduction of tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries. The deal will reportedly delay the implementation of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports that were slated to begin on Nov. 1, while China’s export controls on rare earth elements are also expected to be delayed as the two sides continue negotiations. Trump also expects the two countries to reach a deal on ownership of the social media app TikTok. The U.S. also announced that separate trade and mineral agreements were reached with Malaysia and Cambodia, while trade pact frameworks were struck with Thailand and Vietnam. Shares of U.S. chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which are seeking to sell into Chinese markets, were both up more than 2% in premarket trading. Trump said that the U.S. will slap an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after the Ontario provincial government ran an ad criticizing tariffs during the World Series on Friday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that broadcasts of the ad would end on Monday. Trump has criticized the ad for featuring comments from former President Ronald Reagan, which he described as a “serious misrepresentation of the facts.” Trump had placed a tariff of 35% on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on some products like steel and aluminum are subject to levies of 50%. Trump had previously said trade negotiations with Canada would be “terminated” over the ad. Shares of Avidity Biosciences (RNA) are soaring in premarket trading after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) agreed to buy the biotechnology company in a deal valued at $12 billion. Avidity will spin off part of its early-stage precision cardiology business before closing the deal in the first half of 2026, Novartis said in a statement. “The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said. “We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.” Shares of Avidity jumped more than 40% ahead of the opening bell, while Novartis shares were down about 1%. Shares of U.S.-listed Argentine companies are surging after President Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won a landslide legislative victory. President Donald Trump had offered to provide financial support for Argentina but said that the bailout hinged on the outcome of the election. "BIG WIN in Argentina for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate?," Trump said on Truth Social. Shares of financial services companies Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL), Banco BBVA Argentina SA (BBAR) and Banco Macro SA (BMA) each gained more than 30% in premarket trading. Shares of oil company YPF (YPF) jumped about 25%, while shares of e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI) added 7%.
