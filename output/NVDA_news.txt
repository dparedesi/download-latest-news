Title: Focus On The Data To Avoid Future Bear Traps

Bear and bull in a trap. The stock market was able to rally last week despite the larger-than-expected 0.50% rate cut by the FOMC. As is often the case the averages gyrated after Fed Chair Powell's press conference and higher open the Dow Industrials closed down 293 points. Most will be happy that September is now over as the stock market had a rough start for the month as on September 3rd the S&P 500 gapped 25 points lower and closed down 2.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.1%. Nvidia Corp (NVDA) was down 9.5%. The selling accelerated for the next three days dropping to a low of 5402.62 which was a decline of 4.3% from the pre-labor day weekend close of 5649, point a. In my view, the drop was due in part to the widespread stock market commentary warning investors and traders of September’s poor seasonal track record. Therefore many were on the sidelines or short when the S&P reversed to the upside on September 11th, point b, in reaction to the CPI report. This I felt “ reflected an important change in the market outlook.” The bullish action of the advance/decline lines set the stage for the upside breakout in the S&P 500 in reaction to the FOMC announcement. My view of investing or trading based on seasonal tendencies was reiterated in 2015. “I have written many times in the past about seasonal tendencies and I have always stressed that one should only invest or trade a seasonal trend when the technical studies are in agreement.” Some investors and traders fail to recognize that comments like “the worst performance of any month” are mostly based on averages. In this case, going back to 1945. The unanimity of the commentary I think led to an oversized short position heading into September. Many who took a bearish bet would be surprised to learn that since 2006 the S&P 500 has had September gains of 2.46%, 3.58%, 3.68% and even up 8.71% in 2010. In fact, over the past seventeen years, it has been higher nine times. Exposure to this data may have kept some from selling their positions or buying puts based on the long-term averages. The lower close after the FOMC announcement had some prepared for heavier selling the next day. Instead, the overnight trading was very positive as the Spyder Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) opened 10 points higher or 100 points higher on the S&P 500. This was likely quite tough for those on the wrong side. Markets The bullish end to the week moved most of the averages higher led by the Dow Jones Transportation Average which was up 2.7%. It was followed by a 1.2% in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD SPDR Gold Shares ) which was up 1.2% just barely stronger than the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) 1.1% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.6% while the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF ) was down 0.2%. For the week on the NYSE, 1672 issues were advancing and just 1190 declined. NYSE Composite Monthly The data is still pointing higher as the monthly chart of the NYSE Composite completed a flag formation, lines a and b, in December of 2023. At the time both the NYSE Stocks Only Advance/Decline line and the NYSE All Advance/Decline were above their EMAs and therefore positive. In January of 2024, both advance/decline lines moved through their long-term resistance, lines c and d, which confirmed the positive price action. As we move into October both A/D lines are positive as they are well above their rising EMAs. The widening gap does mean they are getting overbought. In addition to the advance/decline data I also focus on the price and volume data. The price data determines the moving averages and I concentrate on the 20-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the monthly, weekly, daily, and even the hourly data. Invesco QQQ Trust The price data is used to determine the pivot levels as well as the starc bands. This weekly chart of the Invesco QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Trust (QQQ) includes the yearly pivot levels for the past four years. These are based on the prior year's data. From early 2020 until early 2022 QQQ stayed above its pivot. In March 2023, QQQ closed back above the pivot and opened 2024 well above the yearly pivot at $358.78. The weekly Nasdaq 100 Advance/Decline line broke out above the long-term resistance, line b, in November of 2023 (point 3). It has been forming higher highs and higher lows since then as the decline in April 2024 held support before it again surged higher. The weekly relative performance (RS) is one of the key tools I use to determine whether SPY or the QQQ is going to be the best performer. The RS peaked in November 2021 and then dropped sharply. The RS support, line c, was broken in early 2022 (point 1) which indicated that QQQ was now lagging not leading the SPY. The RS downtrend, line d, favored the SPY over the QQQ in 2022. The break of this downtrend and the move above the rising EMA was a sign that QQQ was again leading the SPY. In 2023 the RS stayed above its EMA but it has crossed above and below it several times in 2024. Currently, the RS is below its EMA but rising. If the RS is now able to move back above its EMA that will be a sign that QQQ is again a market leader. Given the global risk factors and the upcoming election, I would not be surprised if there is a sharp 1-3% pullback or two in October. But the strong trend in the advance/decline lines is a positive factor for stocks after the election and into the end of the year. Going forward try to just use hard data in your decision-making process for investing or trading. Avoid making decisions based on any general market commentary, seasonal analysis, or the public investing stance of any large hedge fund. This will help you avoid future bear or bull traps.

Title: SoftBank to Invest $500M in OpenAI for the First Time—Is It Late to the Party?

SoftBank (SFTBF) is looking to invest in OpenAI for the first time. The Japanese conglomerate helmed by billionaire Masayoshi Son has reportedly agreed to chip in $500 million via its second Vision Fund in a round that values the ChatGPT maker at a staggering $150 billion, The Information reported today (Sept. 30). The round is set to be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing $1 billion. Other participants could include Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tiger Global Management and the United Arab Emirates-backed fund MGX. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. SoftBank’s involvement would represent one of Son’s most significant bets on A.I. so far. It would also follow missteps made by the conglomerate’s first Vision Fund, which infamously backed WeWork and suffered heavy losses after its collapse in 2023. Until now, Son’s most notable A.I. investment has been SoftBank’s majority ownership of Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer. SoftBank in May reported a $4.6 billion gain for its Vision Funds for the fiscal year, largely driven by Arm’s 2023 IPO. In the past few years, the conglomerate has been on “defense mode,” said Son during SoftBank’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting last June. “Three years ago, we didn’t have a lot of cash on hand,” said Son at the time, noting that SoftBank has since amassed more than $35 billion. “We are ready to shift to offense mode,” he declared, adding his primary interest was playing a large role in the “A.I. revolution.” Besides partaking in an investment round for Perplexity AI, an A.I.-driven search engine, earlier this year, the company has largely taken a backseat to A.I. startups and reportedly passed on investments in OpenAI competitors like Mistral AI, Anthropic and Cohere. Its willingness to back OpenAI, however, should come as no surprise—Son has repeatedly sung the praises of the company, stating that he is a “heavy user of ChatGPT” and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “one of the key people on Earth.” SoftBank and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment from Observer regarding SoftBank’s investment. SoftBank’s bet on OpenAI is quite late by venture capital standards, given its already colossal valuation. But the high-flying A.I. company still has room for growth, according to analysts. The company hit $3.4 billion in annualized revenue in June and is “progressing towards $5 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven primarily by its ChatGPT product,” Brendan Burke, PitchBook’s senior emerging technology analyst, told Observer via email. PitchBook estimates OpenAI is set to benefit from a generative A.I. software market that is on pace to double next year and exceed $30 billion, he added. “This revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believed the company can grow into,” said Burke. SoftBank’s investment comes at a time of uncertainty for OpenAI. The company last week lost three top executives, and Altman is reportedly planning a restructuring that will change the company’s capped-profit model. “Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,” said Altman in a post on X announcing the recent departures.

Title: Nuclear Power Won’t Solve A.I.’s Energy Problem, Says Hedge Fund Mogul David Tepper
URL: https://observer.com/2024/09/hedge-fund-billionaire-david-tepper-ai-nuclear-energy/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T18:05:19Z

With Big Tech locked in an arms race to become the next dominant A.I. player, companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are heralding nuclear power as a solution to the technology’s energy problem. But the hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, founder and president of Appaloosa Management, believes nuclear power simply won’t be enough for A.I.’s development needs. “Some of these projections are crazy,” he told CNBC on Sept. 26. “If you’re going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you’re going to have to use natural gas,” he said.

You can opt out anytime. As the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta spend billions of dollars on building data centers to power A.I. models, they have also sought out ways to offset these data centers’ massive energy consumption. Data centers are expected to double their energy use by the end of the decade and take up 9 percent of the power supply in the U.S., according to the Electric Power Institute. Nuclear power, including the revival of dormant nuclear plants, has emerged as a way to pursue these ambitions without increasing carbon emissions. Microsoft earlier this month signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, the owner of Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant and the site of a 1979 partial reactor meltdown, in a deal that will reopen one of the site’s two units. And in March, Amazon Web Services struck a $650 million deal with the energy company Talen Energy to acquire a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania. Despite the tech world’s optimism about nuclear as a carbon-free alternative, Tepper, who is “exploring different parts of the energy side of the tech market,” said there are too many hurdles to cross when it comes to reviving nuclear power. Governors around the country “aren’t going to let their nuclear power come offline—it’s not going to happen, it’s a joke,” Tepper told CNBC. “It will never get by these individual [public utility commissions].” Tepper currently has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion. His hedge fund is one of the most successful in recent history, having gained a total of $35 billion since its inception in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tepper is also the owner of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers team, which he acquired for around $2.2 billion in 2018. Energy consumption isn’t the only aspect of A.I. that Tepper is unsure about. In June, Tepper unloaded more than 80 percent of his stake in Nvidia (NVDA), the chip maker leading the A.I. boom. The move, which reduced his Nvidia holding to around $85 million, was caused by Tepper’s belief that the stock “was too high at the time and would come down.” “Unfortunately, we didn’t buy it when it came back down,” he said. While the billionaire said Nvidia is looking great for 2024 and 2025, he’s less confident about the company’s prospects—and the sustainability of current A.I. hype—in 2026 and 2027. “I just don’t know how you know,” he said. “It’s not my preferred vehicle versus other things that I have more confidence in.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: TikTok's owner is reportedly developing an AI model with Huawei's chips

Time Published: 2024-09-30T15:39:00Z

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

Title: Super Micro Computer's big stock split is today. Here’s what to know
URL: https://qz.com/super-micro-computer-stock-split-1851660648
Time Published: 2024-09-30T14:35:00Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted—and substantially lower—price. Shortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer’s shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company’s shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn’t affect the company’s valuation. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: Are Stocks Overvalued?

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology’s superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner’s cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, “It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.” In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn’t an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn’t feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise.

Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company’s financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro’s fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included “sibling self-dealing and evading sanctions”. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg’s report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro’s team. Hindenburg’s team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn’t help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg’s report contained, “misleading presentations of information”. Super Micro hasn’t provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro’s status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company’s business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia’s growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia’s ascent. That’s what we saw for several quarters. We just don’t know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it’s impossible to overlook Hindenburg’s allegations against Super Micro, it’s still worthwhile assessing the company’s previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro’s declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don’t yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There’s a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it’s quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There’s an old adage that suggests, “You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain”. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it’s hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company’s recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I’m a big fan of Super Micro’s industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don’t expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

In this article, we will look at the 20 geopolitical events with highest impact on S&P 500. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500. The geopolitical events impact the financial markets across the world depending on the nature of the event. The assassination attempt on former US President Donald J. Trump is the latest geopolitical event investors have had to grapple with in recent years, alongside two major wars including Russia-Ukraine and ongoing Israel’s aggression on Gaza. Wars have far-reaching effects such as an impact on financial markets, in addition to enormous human toll. Geopolitics events that affect the economy drastically caution investors to look for safe haven investments or be out of the market until the situation comes to normal. According to JP Morgan Private Bank’s recent client survey, 34% of the investors were potentially worried about geopolitical risks, while 29% of investors were bothered by potential recession fears in 2024. Whereas, almost 90% of the geopolitical events have not changed the direction of the world economy, as per Citigroup Inc.’s Global Wealth Report 2024. Geopolitical events mostly have short-term impacts on global asset prices. However, World War II and the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo had the gravest impact on the financial markets. The 1973 oil shock did have a lasting impact on equity returns. During the first 90 days, the S&P 500 plunged by nearly 13.04%, the highest among geopolitical events since 1940. The oil supply was limited for an extended period, leading to a macro state of ‘stagflation.’ In simple terms, high oil prices essentially stopped the economy from operating efficiently in the 1970s. On the other side, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked global energy markets in 2022. However, additional oil supply limited the economic and market impact compared to its 1970s counterpart. Today, the US has a more secure oil supply compared to its heavy reliance on the Middle East. In recent times, the rising conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war have had major consequences. The US has been aiding Ukraine and Israel with military assistance. According to the US State Department, the US government has provided more than $55.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine to fight against Russian invasion since the war began in February 2022. Whereas, the US government has supported Israel through legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid, as of April 2024. It has been a see-saw year for the global economies. The intensified conflict in the Middle East may impact oil prices with a potential disruption in regional supply. As of September 23, oil prices have been high as the conflicts soar, and due to last week's outsized US interest rate cut expectations. As reported by Reuters, Yeap Jun Rong, the market strategist at IG International, said: “Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have edged up a notch between Israel and Hezbollah, which could leave oil prices well-supported on the risks of a wider regional conflict." Brent crude futures for November were up $0.60, or 0.8% at $75.09 per barrel, while the US crude futures for November were up $0.64, or 0.9%, at $71.64, as of September 23. In addition, both oil benchmarks soared over 4% last week due to the US rate cut, weaker demand sentiment in top oil importer China is capping the upswing, reported Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading American multinationals in the oil and gas sector. The company engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas both domestically and internationally. Exxon Mobil Corporation recently signed a MOU with an EV maker SK On. The oil and gas company has agreed to provide 100,000 metric tons of MobilTMLithium from its first planned project in Arkansas. This deal will help ExxonMobil’s goal of supplying lithium for almost 1 million EV batteries annually by 2030 and support the build-out of a US EV supply chain. For the second quarter of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) surpassed earnings estimates, reporting an EPS of $2.14, up by 6.51% compared to anticipated earnings of $2.02 per share. Exxon Mobil posted $9.2 billion in earnings, making its second-best Q2 performance in the past decade. The company achieved this feat following record production in Guyana and the Permian Basin, where the output reached 1.2 million barrels per day. The company’s revenue came in at $93.06 billion, exceeding estimated revenue of $89.68 billion. Alongside strong operational results, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gave back $9.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. XOM has more than 40 years of consistent dividend growth and averaged a 2.20% yield over the past five years. In addition, Exxon Mobil plans to invest between $20 billion and $25 billion annually in capital expenditures through 2027. With strong hedge fund sentiment, XOM is one of the 10 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. Hedge fund interest in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) soared from 81 in Q1 2024 to 92 in Q2 2024. Madison Dividend Income Fund pointed out regarding XOM in the Q1 2024 investor letter: “Our thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per yearthrough 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel…” (Click here to read the full text) While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Now, let’s take a look at the 20 geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Our Methodology To compile the data for 20 geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500, we gathered the data from Citigroup Inc.’s Global Wealth Report 2024. We have ranked the 20 geopolitical events in descending order of the highest average impact on the S&P 500, which includes initial impact, 30-day impact, and 90-day impact. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Initial Impact: -3.78% 30-days Impact: 7.61% 90-days Impact: 17.16% Average impact: 6.99% The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was a confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This was one of the moments two superpowers came close to nuclear conflict. The initial impact of this event was critical and the S&P 500 dropped by almost 3.78%. In the next 30 days and 90 days, the S&P 500 recovered and surged by 7.61% and 17.16%, respectively. The Cuban Missile Crisis was one of the most significant geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: 2.49% 30-days Impact: 2.06% 90-days Impact: 15.57% Average impact: 6.70% In March 2003, the US forces invaded Iraq to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and end the dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. Today, the Iraqi government is asking the US government to withdraw the left troops from their soil. The US invasion of Iraq did not hurt the market and the average impact was on the S&P 500 index was a rise of nearly 6.70%. The US invasion of Iraq ranks among the 20 geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: -2.81% 30-days Impact: 3.06% 90-days Impact: 8.28% Average impact: 2.84% The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who served as the 35th US President, was one of the biggest events in modern history and had a far-reaching impact on US politics. JFK assassination slowed the market and the average impact was around 2.84% of growth. JFK's assassination ranks 18th among the geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: -4.16% 30-days Impact: 0.09% 90-days Impact: 12.1% Average impact: 2.67% The Gulf War was an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the US. The initial impact of the Gulf War on the S&P 500 index was quite notable with the market dropping by more than 4%. However, within three months the market had recovered but the war had an intense impact on the market during the initial period. The Gulf War ranks among the 20 geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: -2.30% 30-days Impact: 4.30% 90-days Impact: 3.72% Average impact: 1.91% Brexit is one of the biggest events in Europe in recent times. Brexit is a portmanteau of the words ‘British’ and ‘exit’, referring to the UK’s referendum to leave the European Union (EU) on June 23, 2016. Brexit is one of the recent geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: -0.24% 30-days Impact: -0.64% 90-days Impact: 4.44% Average impact: 1.19% The 2017 escalation began with North Korea’s testing of ballistic missiles over the Sea of Japan. This event was of grave concern to the US government. The 2017 escalation negatively impacted the market during its initial 30-day period. Initial Impact: -0.31% 30-days Impact: 1.67% 90-days Impact: 2.04% Average impact: 1.13% Before the 9/11 event, the World Trade Center suffered from a bombing terrorist attack. The market slowed down during the initial days of the event. The World Trade Center bombing ranks among the 20 geopolitical events with the highest impact on the S&P 500. Initial Impact: 2.95% 30-days Impact: -1.39% 90-days Impact: 0.16% Average impact: 0.57% The US government under President Ronald Reagan carried out air strikes, code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, against Libya on 15 April 1986.

Title: Hedge Funds Think NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Is The Best Most Active Stock To Buy Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks. The economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. As stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...” However, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts. In a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial. Kantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary. He noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support. Looking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability. Kantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy. Methodology We sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Volume: 120.458 million Average Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning. In FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance. At its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities. The company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year

Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose approximately 151%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: Why Nvidia stock could soar over 500% by the end of the decade, former consulting exec says

Nvidia is headed for a meteoric run-up by the end of the decade, according to one former consulting exec. Phil Panaro — a former senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group who also served as CEO of a BCG subsidiary — says shares of the AI chipmaker will reach $800 by 2030. That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday. The Jensen Huang-led firm will benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, as well as migration from Web2 to Web3, Panaro predicted, referring to the idea that the internet's next era will be denominated by blockchain technology. Those developments could result in big spending from Nvidia's customers, he said, pointing to estimates from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley that Web3 could fuel trillions of added value in the market. "Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that," Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030. Investors may not have to wait long to see some of those gains. Panaro foresees a "huge explosion" in the stock after Nvidia releases Blackwell, its next-gen AI chip, though he didn't specify his short-term price target. "Not to sound overconfident — it's actually inevitable provided that they can continue to make these chips," he later added of the firm's upside potential. "The AI penetration in the economy right now is literally less than 1%. So you still have all the corporates, the cities, the municipalities, the governments, the military, that are going to be spending money to make sure they leverage AI effectively. So tons of money still to be spent." Some strategists have been skeptical over Nvidia's rally, with the stock up a monster 2,733% over the last five years. Analysts have attributed some of that growth to "hyperscalers," a small group of Big Tech firms buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities. But despite concerns those customers could eventually pull away, the small group of buyers is actually a good sign Nvidia's business will scale, Panaro said. "That's actually the best case for why it's actually going to go up. Because if you look at all the other customers they're not getting to, there's 490 other Fortune 500 firms that haven't really adopted AI to the fullest because they don't understand it. You have all these cities and governments that are going to be redoing all their infrastructure from Web2 to Web3, and you then have the AI arms race, with countries and their militaries, which Nvidia hasn't penetrated for the most part," Panaro said. He continued: "The stock can go to the moon, essentially, provided that they deliver." Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Wall Street SWOT: NVIDIA stock rides AI wave amid tech sector challenges

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, leveraging its strong position in graphics processing units (GPUs) to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure. As the company prepares to report its July quarter earnings, analysts remain bullish on NVIDIA's prospects, despite concerns about product delays and increasing competition in the AI chip space. NVIDIA's data center segment has been the primary driver of the company's recent growth, with revenues expanding significantly year-over-year. The strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper GPU computing platform, coupled with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, has propelled the company's financial performance. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with some projecting NVIDIA's earnings per share (EPS) to exceed $10 by 2030. The company's full-stack ecosystem positions it to capture 70-80% of the value in the parallel processing era, according to some analysts. This dominance is supported by NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and deepening system software capabilities, which are seen as key differentiators in sustaining its growth trajectory. NVIDIA's product roadmap includes the ramp-up of its next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell, which is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming quarters. Despite reports of a slight delay in Blackwell's production, analysts remain confident in NVIDIA's ability to meet demand through increased shipments of its current Hopper architecture. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. NVIDIA's AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings aim to simplify AI rollouts for enterprises, potentially opening up new revenue streams as businesses increasingly adopt AI technologies. While NVIDIA maintains a dominant position in the AI chip market, competition is intensifying. Traditional semiconductor companies like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are ramping up their efforts in the AI space, while major tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are developing custom silicon solutions for their AI needs. Despite these competitive pressures, analysts believe NVIDIA's technological lead and ecosystem advantages will allow it to maintain its market leadership in the near term. The company's ability to introduce new SKUs and adapt to changing market demands, such as developing the H20 product to meet export control requirements for the Chinese market, demonstrates its agility in responding to challenges. NVIDIA's financial projections paint a picture of robust growth. Analysts estimate the company's revenue to grow from $60.92 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $203.42 billion by fiscal year 2027. Similarly, EPS is expected to increase from $1.15 to $4.85 over the same period. The company's strong balance sheet, with improving financial ratios such as net debt/EBITDA moving into negative territory, provides NVIDIA with flexibility to invest in research and development and pursue strategic initiatives. Recent reports of delays in NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have raised concerns about potential impacts on the company's competitive edge. While analysts generally view these delays as short-term issues, they could provide an opening for competitors to gain ground in the rapidly evolving AI chip market. If NVIDIA fails to execute its product roadmap effectively, it may face challenges in maintaining its dominant market share and meeting the growing demand for AI computing power. NVIDIA's global operations, particularly its reliance on manufacturing partners in Asia, expose it to geopolitical risks and potential export controls. The company has already faced challenges in selling certain high-performance chips to China due to U.S. government restrictions. While NVIDIA has developed products like the H20 to comply with these regulations, further tightening of export controls could significantly impact its ability to serve key markets. This geopolitical uncertainty adds a layer of risk to NVIDIA's growth prospects and could affect investor confidence in the long term. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and extensive ecosystem of developers and applications create a significant moat around its business. This ecosystem advantage makes it challenging for competitors to replicate NVIDIA's full-stack offerings, potentially locking in customers and developers for the long term. As AI applications become more prevalent across industries, NVIDIA's established ecosystem could drive sustained growth and market leadership, even in the face of increasing competition. While NVIDIA is best known for its GPUs in gaming and data centers, the company is actively expanding into new markets such as automotive, healthcare, and robotics. These diversification efforts could provide additional growth vectors and reduce NVIDIA's reliance on any single market segment. If successful, this strategy could help NVIDIA maintain its growth trajectory even if its core markets face temporary headwinds or increased competition. The company's efforts in areas like autonomous driving and AI-powered medical imaging could open up substantial new revenue streams in the coming years. NVIDIA Corporation continues to navigate the complex landscape of the AI and semiconductor industries, balancing strong growth prospects with emerging challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to maintain technological leadership, expand into new markets, and manage geopolitical risks will be crucial in determining its long-term success. Investors and analysts will be closely watching NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and guidance for further insights into its trajectory in the rapidly evolving AI market.
