Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+7.89%) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker’s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.61%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

Title: Tesla's stock slide looks to be unrelenting

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) stock has known only one direction in February: reverse. Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker dropped another 2% to $321 each in pre-market trading on Wednesday, continuing an eye-opening slide from their recent 52-week high. At its current pre-market price, Tesla's stock is down 33% since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for President Donald Trump — who was heavily backed by Musk. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven" group of tech megacaps: Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL). Musk's net worth — which is closely connected to the fortunes of Tesla — has plunged $54 billion year to date, according to Bloomberg data. He is still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $378 billion "The bears are owning the narrative," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me. And the bears have a lot to feast on regarding Tesla at the moment. For starters, numbers on Tesla sales in important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. "We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker," Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises "There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective," Rusch said. The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued. Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively. Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be "a little bit challenged" in the coming years, unless the company can "deliver on a number of promises" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.

Chip foundries are responsible for producing a critical part of every piece of technology in the world. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is perhaps the most well-known chip manufacturer, known for fabricating advanced chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). The Taiwan-based chipmaker has a 92% share in advanced AI chip production, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by JPMorgan (JPM). Total global chip foundry revenue was $131.7 billion in 2024, according to TrendForce data cited by the firm. Seven chip foundries, including U.S.-based Tower (TSEM) and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, each have a 1% share of total global revenue, according to the data, while 3% of the total is shared by “Others.” Taiwanese chipmakers command a 70% share of the total revenue, while Korean companies made up 11%, and Chinese chip foundries had 8%. Here are the top six chip producers in the world by revenue share. Chinese pure-play foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor had a 2% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. China’s partially state-owned, pure-play chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as SMIC, had a 5% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. U.S.-based chip designer and manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GFS) had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan’s first chip company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Samsung, one of the world’s main producers of high-bandwidth memory chips, had a 10% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had a 62% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024.

Title: Gold Miners or NVIDIA? You Choose…

Time Published: 2025-02-11T23:00:56Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted February 11, 2025 You have a choice… You can either own Stock A that’s down 10% on the year amid negative headlines. Or you can own Stock B trading at record highs with a 17% return year-to-date. Perhaps it seems like a no-brainer. I prefer to buy strength and sell weakness, so I know I would take Stock B any day. Headlines aside, Stock A’s near-term drawdown puts it at a disadvantage right off the bat. Plus, I find it difficult to pass up new all-time highs. But once we pull back the curtain on our mystery stocks, the choice is far from cut and dry. If you haven’t already guessed, Stock A is Nvidia (NVDA), the market darling that has lost its sparkle. All eyes have been on NVDA for over a year, and it has only intensified (if that’s possible) following the DeepSeek fiasco. To be clear, I’m not bearish on Nvidia. I think it’s the same great company it was three weeks ago. I’m simply looking for opportunities that could provide strength and stability as uncertainty spreads across the market. Opportunities like Stock B: Alamos Gold (AGI). I know we’ve all had our fair share of war stories involving gold mining stocks. But before you start throwing rotten tomatoes, please hear me out… Gold is hitting record highs. And if the shiny yellow rock’s advance measures up to past secular bulls, this rally has legs! Check out the gold chart zoomed out to the mid-1970s. Notice the explosive rallies followed by prolonged trendless markets. After ripping roughly 750% during the 70s, gold went nowhere for my entire youth into early adulthood (almost 25 years). Of course, that changed during the 2000s when gold jumped from $250 bucks to $2,000. Another bout of lifeless action mired precious metal markets until last year. Today, gold is printing record highs. But it’s up a mere 150% off its 2015 low compared to the 650%+ gains of previous bull cycles. Some might attribute gold’s lackluster rally to the real store-of-value asset: Bitcoin. Perhaps. But I view Bitcoin and crypto generally as tech stocks. I’ve never noticed a sustained flight to safety into Bitcoin. Plus, crypto has a strong tendency to trend with the S&P 500 technology sector. My best guess as to why gold hasn’t hit $5k lands somewhere between “no one is paying attention” and “no one wants a dumb yellow rock.” Both work. However, rising gold prices will eventually capture more eyes creating a positive feedback loop as more investors turn to gold — ultimately Making Gold Great Again. Of course, by then it will be too late. Sure, you might capture the last leg or two of the rally, but you’ll also catch the increased volatility. The final stages of commodity bull markets are notoriously violent. Now is the time to consider precious metals, especially mining stocks. Here’s why… During the 2000s bull run, Hecla Mining (HL) gained 2,200% while Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) cruised to a cool 3,300%. These numbers might sound similar to the performance of your favorite tech stock — and they should! Mining stocks become the ultimate speculative growth trade during gold bull markets. And most mining names are trading well below past cycle highs. Here’s gold and the Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) side by side: GDXJ has yet to break above its 2020 high, let alone its 2011 peak. Today, it’s bebopping around $50–$130 below its all-time high set during the last bull run. Imagine the face-ripping rallies across the mining space if and when GDXJ starts to catch toward gold. They’ll look just like Nvidia’s rally off the 2022 lows. A handful of names are already moving. Iamgold (IAG) has climbed 600% over the past two years and its rally has only accelerated since gold’s breakout last year. However, names such as IAG break the mold. The broader mining space has some serious ground to cover… You don’t need to chase $50M market-cap companies — or $500M market-cap companies for that matter. Plenty of solid businesses operate within the metal and mining space. Alamos Gold, Stock B from earlier, touts a $9B market cap. It’s also been around since 2003, which means it survived a full cycle. I like that! And, of course, it’s posting all-time highs. You could also keep it classy by trading one of the bellwethers, like Agnico Eagles Mines (AEM). It broke out of a multi-decade base last week to a new record high. Plus, it’s mined metals and minerals since 1957 and carries a market cap of $47.5B. If you’re feeling lucky and want to take a swing with a five-letter ticker, you will find plenty of gold miners to choose from. I prefer to sleep at night, so I lean toward the larger and more established companies. But Wesdome Gold Mines (WDOFF) is the exception as it teases fresh two-year highs. Could WDOFF post NVDA-like gains? It might if gold continues to rally. Bottom line: Taking a gold position today is taking a position in near-term strength. It’s buying an asset increasing in value — before the crowd shows up and spoils the fun. Don’t get me wrong, I like trading AI stocks as much as anyone else. I simply prefer holding the strongest assets as the market merry-go-round kicks into high gear.

Title: 3 new reasons to dump Magnificent 7 stocks
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-new-reasons-to-dump-magnificent-7-stocks-200016898.html
Time Published: 2025-02-11T20:00:16Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up. "Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent," Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year. Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks — despite their sell-off — also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, "The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern." Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. "We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their fund’s beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years," Parker said. One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness. Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Mag Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found. With the investment thesis on the Mag Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Why Tesla's stock has been cratering

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Elon Musk may be President Trump's first buddy, but Tesla (TSLA) investors have swung back to focusing more on the company's fundamentals than the billionaire's close proximity to the Resolute desk. Their decision? To send Tesla's stock tumbling less than two months into 2025. Shares of the electric vehicle maker led by Musk are down 28% to $349.18 since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for Trump. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven," which includes Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL). At the time, enthusiasm was running high that Musk's fierce support of Trump would unlock big-time profits as driverless cars would get quicker approval — among other bullish lines of thinking. But since reaching that peak, Tesla's stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average, according to Yahoo Finance data. The next test of investor sentiment on Tesla is coming at $334, or the 100-day moving average. Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286. Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024. "Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note. Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target. The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous. For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers. On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. "They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter," Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results "kind of squishy." Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report. "Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition," Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.61%) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.22%) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT-0.12%). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL+0.24%) and Softbank (SFTBY+2.26%) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.

Title: CoinEx Research January 2025 Report: Trumpian Bitcoin Amid Alts Anxiety

February 10, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research's January 2025 report highlights a volatile month that is shaped by political developments, institutional participation, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 to reach a new all-time high, while altcoins struggled due to liquidity drained by Trump-related tokens. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI model further unsettled global tech and crypto markets, leading to a valuation reset. Institutional Bitcoin adoption continued to gain traction, but a late-month pullback raised concerns about potential market consolidation. A Volatile Start to 2025Bitcoin opened the year at approximately $92,500 and closed near $102,000, demonstrating resilience despite a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a strong labour market and persistent inflation, while the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. The launch of the Official Trump Memecoin and Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI) captured market attention, but their liquidity absorption limited altcoin growth. Given the current conditions, Bitcoin may enter a near-term consolidation phase due to the lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The Trump Effect: Memecoins and DeFi Expansion Donald Trump’s influence in the crypto market grew significantly ahead of his inauguration. His team launched the Official Trump Memecoin on Solana’s Meteora platform, bypassing traditional SOL-based liquidity providers like Raydium. This decision helped push Solana’s stablecoin supply beyond $9 billion, a 130% increase, and drove Solana’s DEX trading volume to an all-time high of $258 billion, three times that of Ethereum. The memecoin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion at its peak, surpassing leading memecoins such as SHIB, PEPE, and WIF. The speculative rally continued with the surprise launch of the Melania Token by First Lady Melania Trump, further intensifying trading activity. However, back-to-back token launches exhausted market liquidity, leading to an eventual pullback. Meanwhile, the Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI), a DeFi project on Ethereum, successfully raised over $300 million in its presale. This signaled that the Trump crypto narrative extended beyond memecoins to include institutional-style DeFi products, blending speculative and financial elements. DeepSeek AI’s Disruptive Impact on Global Markets China’s DeepSeek AI model, launched just before the Lunar New Year, sent shockwaves through global AI and financial markets. With a training cost significantly lower than its Western counterparts—DeepSeek introduced a cost-efficient alternative powered by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This method optimizes computational efficiency by selectively activating only the most relevant sub-networks per query. DeepSeek’s debut triggered a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) plummeting 17% in a single day as investors reassessed the competitive landscape. AI-themed crypto tokens also suffered heavy losses due to broader risk-off sentiment. However, rather than being a structural threat, DeepSeek’s emergence represents a necessary market recalibration that could accelerate AI adoption and unlock new crypto-related opportunities. Source: LiveBench Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Policy Shifts Institutional participation in Bitcoin remained strong in January, supported by major policy developments. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda established a crypto task force, and President Trump signed an executive order in his first week promoting crypto innovation, signaling a shift toward broader adoption. In Illinois, lawmakers advanced a bill to create a state Bitcoin reserve, following Arizona’s move to integrate cryptocurrency into public finance. Outside the U.S., sovereign institutions also increased their Bitcoin exposure. The Czech Central Bank approved Bitcoin for inclusion in its national reserves, while Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund disclosed a 150% year-on-year increase in its Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding $350 million. These moves highlighted a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value among government treasuries and institutional investors. Stablecoin Inflows and Market Caution Stablecoins continued to see strong inflows, with approximately $9.9 billion entering the market in January. This sustained a three-month trend of capital influx, supporting the bullish structure of the market. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs coincided with these inflows, reinforcing the importance of stablecoin liquidity in market momentum. However, despite the positive trend, a notable market pullback in late January suggests a cautious outlook. If stablecoin inflows slow or turn into net outflows, the market could face a period of consolidation, leading to increased volatility. Investors should closely monitor stablecoin trends as an indicator of broader market sentiment. Market Outlook for February 2025 Looking ahead, the market’s direction in February will be shaped by institutional developments, regulatory policies, and stablecoin movements. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss. Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday. “The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”. According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries. France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI. “The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 7, Timothy Arcuri from UBS maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $185.00. Besides UBS, analyst Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the stock and calls Nvidia a “top pick”. On February 6th, Moore reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $152 price target. He said investors should buy in the DeepSeek dip. “While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build [and] customer desire to spend is clearly on display. We remain very optimistic on how the balance of the year plays out.” Amongst other things, Moore believes the biggest long-term catalyst for Nvidia goes beyond AI training and into the company’s leadership in the inference market. Inference is a process where trained AI models apply its knowledge to new data and then making predictions or decisions based on that data. “We remain convinced that Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of long inference workloads.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeepSeek's efficiency means Big Tech must stop hoarding, creating more winners. Here are the 12 stocks expected to benefit.

The good, bad, and the ugly are merging as AI enters the next stage of development: competition and efficiency. We all knew this day would come, but perhaps not as soon as it did. DeepSeek's more efficient and cheaper model means Big Tech suddenly has a chink in its armor. Investors question whether they have overvalued the blue chips and their pricing power, especially concerning their proprietary language models. It will be a volatile ride until Wall Street figures that out. For now, AI-related stocks have been dumping almost indiscriminately or at the slightest hint of a slowdown. Chip designer ARM was a recent victim of that trend. It announced earnings Wednesday with some of the best numbers you can get on a typical stock, said Sandeep Rao, a quantitative analyst at Leverage Shares ETPs. Still, the stock closed down by over 7%. "It's clearly evident that this stock is supposed to be soaring," Rao said. "The company's IP is used in virtually every major smartphone in the world. Its software is also used by Apple computers. It has a tie-up with Nvidia, and its backup is SoftBank, which is part of the Stargate project pumping $500 billion into AI cloud infrastructure." ARM CEO Rene Haas also welcomed DeepSeek during its February 5 earnings call, referring to it as "creative" and a welcomed efficiency that would only increase demand for computing. He added that his company was well-positioned to take advantage of efficiencies, including for smaller devices that don't require high-powered Nvidia chips. ARM isn't alone. As AI stocks report earnings, they find themselves in a similar predicament: explaining to Wall Street's money movers that they are well-positioned to continue riding out the AI hype. DeepSeek isn't exactly open source; in other words, it doesn't share its full code. It's open weight, which means it shows its memory or knowledge process. This allows users to adjust it for specific tasks, lowering the bar for startups and companies to enter the space and create specialized business models that could lead to affordability, increased demand, and explosive growth. Before DeepSeek, proprietary models required huge computing power, which meant expensive and small supercomputers were the perceived solution for efficiency. DeepSeek changed that thesis, suggesting that optimization isn't a hardware problem but one that can be addressed with code, Rao said. It also proved that the open-source community was far more efficient at driving results, validating the argument that AI and machine learning should not be done behind closed doors, Rao added. It's a technology that can best be done as a tide that lifts all boats instead of one that's hoarded by a few. But in terms of winners and losers, investors should be concerned with the picks and shovels: companies tasked with building AI infrastructure, said Abby Yoder, a US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. The focus must now turn to their revenue and gross margin line items to determine whether they will see the impact. She added that CapEx spending isn't dropping; it's actually increasing, but it could be shifting elsewhere. "So, are they going to be going to the incumbent winners that we've seen over the past couple of years who have had this outsized pricing power leading to those really high margins?" Yoder said. Or are they going to semiconductor companies making specialized chips, hardware providers, or software companies? It's the key query investors will need to be able to answer if they want to continue winning in this space. On JPMorgan's part, the investment bank's North America equity research team created a list of stocks they're overweight on and that they expect will be positively impacted by competitive and efficient AI. Software Companies that can use efficiency to increase their total addressable markets will be the new big winners. Here, Yoder believes it will be the software companies. Cloud-based data storage provider Snowflake (SNOW) is positioned to benefit from increased demand as more AI applications develop, increasing the requirement for data storage services. Cloud-based software provider Salesforce (CRM) could be at the forefront of benefiting from cheaper and therefore increased software use. Semiconductors In the semiconductor space, Yoder says an investor should focus on those gaining versus those losing market share. Overall, the demand for AI chips is expected to increase, not drop, though that may not be the case for every chipmaker, read JPMorgan's note. Within this sector, companies that provide application-specific integrated circuits" (ASICs), which are microchips made for certain functions instead of general use, are well-positioned to gain from the increased use of more accessible AI models. ASIC suppliers set to benefit include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL). Micron (MU) is expected to benefit as a memory and storage chip provider as AI adoption accelerates. Despite fears about how necessary Nvidia's (NVDA) expensive and advanced chips will be, increased demand for AI models will also mean increased demand for GPUs. Internet and hyperscalers The big, leading names like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta sit in this category. Not only are they developers of AI models, but they are also the spenders that largely determine where money for infrastructure and software will go. Here, efficiency will create a cheaper and broader ecosystem for AI on the internet, and the sharing of developments will push the big players to also become efficient, read JPMorgan's note, which projects 2025 capex spending for Amazon at $97 billion, Meta at $65 billion, and Google at $62 billion. Since Meta's Llama model is also open weight, it's expected to be a main beneficiary of language models like DeepSeek, where its efficiency can be integrated into Meta's ecosystem. "At 4Q earnings, META reiterated the benefits of open source LLMs, noted that costs can be driven down, & — in light of DeepSeek — emphasized the importance of having an American standard for open source that extends globally," JP Morgan's note read. Amazon is also not shying away from more efficacious models. Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. The global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump’s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market’s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump’s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead. Fidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector’s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired “soft landing,” says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates. The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals. Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Average Upside Potential: 36.0% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley gave an “Overweight” rating on the company’s stock, providing a price target of $152. The analyst noted that China’s DeepSeek, an AI model matching its American rivals in performance and at a much cheaper cost, established some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) around export controls and longer-term investment. Despite these challenges, Moore opines that near-term checks remain strong for its Hopper platform. The analyst believes that Blackwell’s supply visibility has been building and that customers’ desire to spend remains clearly visible. Elsewhere, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial upped the company’s stock to “Strong Buy,” raising its price objective to $220. Even though DeepSeek's R1 AI model has been claiming competitive features at lower costs, Tigress Financial noted unknown capabilities and security concerns. The firm lauded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s critical role in AI and data center growth and sees it as a long-term beneficiary of continued investments. Furthermore, lawmakers in the US have plans to ban DeepSeek. The AI infrastructure build-out continues to act as a major tailwind for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, cloud service providers, sovereign states, and consumer internet companies have been fueling demand for AI computing power. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.” Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.
