You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

Full Content:
Zvi Mowshowitz of the Don't Worry About the Vase substack did an excellent job writing up the key dynamics of the deal. I’ll be running excerpts from his post with some comments of mine interspersed. Our government, having withdrawn the new diffusion rules, has now announced an agreement to sell massive numbers of highly advanced AI chips to UAE and Saudi Arabia (KSA). This post analyzes that deal and that decision. It is possible, given sufficiently strong agreement details (which are not yet public and may not be finalized) and private unvoiced considerations, that this deal contains sufficient safeguards and justifications that, absent ability to fix other American policy failures, this decision is superior to the available alternatives. Perhaps these are good deals, with sufficiently strong security arrangements that will actually stick. Perhaps UAE and KSA are more important markets and general partners than we realize, and the rest of the world really is unable to deploy capital and electrical power the way they can and there is nothing we can do to change this, and perhaps they have other points of strategic importance, so we have to deal with them. Perhaps they are reliable American allies going forward who wouldn’t use this as leverage, for reasons I do not understand. There are potential worlds where this makes sense. The fact remains that the case being made for this deal, in public, actively makes the situation seem worse. David Sacks in particular is doubling down and extending the rhetoric I pushed back against last week, when I targeted Obvious Nonsense in AI diffusion discourse. Even within the White House, the China hawks are questioning this deal, and Sacks responded by claiming to not even understand their objections and to all but accuse such people of being traitorous decels wearing trench coats. I stand by my statements last week that even if accept the premise that all we need care about are ‘America wins the AI race’ and how we must ‘beat China,’ our government’s policies, on diffusion and elsewhere, seem determined to lose an AI race against China. The point of the diffusion rules is to keep the AI chips secure and out of Chinese hands, both in terms of physical security and use of their compute via remote access. It is possible that the agreements we are making with UAE and KSA will replace and improve upon the functionality, in those countries in particular, of the diffusion rules. It’s not about a particular set of rules. It is about the effect of those rules. Give me a better way to get the same effect, and I’m happy to take it. When I say ‘something similar’ below, I mean in the sense of sufficient safeguards against the diversion of either the physical AI chips or the compute from the AI chips. Access to those chips is what matters most. Whereas market share in selling AI chips is not something I am inclined to worry about except in my role as Nvidia shareholder. I do not consider them reliable allies going forward, and there are various reasons that even the best version of these agreements would make me deeply uncomfortable, but it is possible to reach an agreement that physically locates many data centers in the Middle East and lets them reap the financial benefits of their investments and have compute available for local use, but does not in the most meaningful senses ‘hand them’ the compute in question. As in, no I do not trust them, but we could find a way that we do not have to, if they were fully open to whatever it took to make that happen. I also would highlight the implicit claim I made here, that the pool of American advanced AI chips is essentially fixed, and that we have sufficient funding available in Big Tech to buy all of them indefinitely. If that is not true, then the UAE/KSA money matters a lot more. Then there is the similar question of whether we were going to actually run out of available electrical power with no way to get around that. A lot of the question comes down to: What would have counterfactually happened to those chips? Would we have been unable to deploy them? [Jordan: See ChinaTalk’s recent coverage of an excellent IFP report that explored what a policy agenda to rapidly increase the energy available for AI deployment would look like] Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity With that in mind, here are the central points I highlighted last week: America is ahead of China in AI. Diffusion rules serve to protect America’s technological lead where it matters. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not reliable American allies, nor are they important markets for our technology. We should not be handing them large shares of the world’s most valuable resource, compute. The exact diffusion rule is gone but something similar must take its place, to do otherwise would be how America ‘loses the AI race.’ Not having any meaningful regulations at all on AI, or ‘building machines that are smarter and more capable than humans,’ is not a good idea, nor would it mean America would ‘lose the AI race.’ AI is currently virtually unregulated as a distinct entity, so ‘repeal 10 regulations for every one you add’ is to not regulate at all building machines that are soon likely to be smarter and more capable than humans, or anything else either. ‘Winning the AI race’ is about racing to superintelligence. It is not about who gets to build the GPU. The reason to ‘win’ the ‘race’ is not market share in selling big tech solutions. It is especially not about who gets to sell others the AI chips. If we care about American dominance in global markets, including tech markets, stop talking about how what we need to do is not regulate AI, and start talking about the things that will actually help us, or at least stop doing the things that actively hurt us and could actually make us lose. Diffusion controls on AI chips we’ve enforced on China so far have had a huge impact. DeepSeek put out a highly impressive AI model, but by their own statements they were severely handicapped by lack of compute. Chinese adoption of AI is also greatly held back by lack of inference compute. China is competing in spite of this severe disadvantage. It is vital that we hold their feet to the fire on this. China has an acute chip shortage, because it physically cannot make more AI chips, so any chips it would ship to a place like UAE or KSA would each be one less chip available in China. Whenever you see arguments from David Sacks and others against AI diffusion rules, ask the question: Is an argument for a different set of export controls and a different chip regime that still protects against China getting large quantities of advanced AI chips? Or is it an argument, as it often is, that to preserve our edge in compute we should sell off our compute, that to preserve our edge in tech we should give away our edge in tech? As in, that what matters is our market share of AI chips, not who uses them? This is not a strawman, for example Ben Thompson argues exactly this very explicitly and repeatedly. Ben Thompson’s recent interview with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, made it clear both of them have this exact position. That to maintain America’s edge in AI, we need to sell our AI chips to whoever wants them, including China, because ‘China will not be held back’ as if having a lot more chips wouldn’t have helped them. And essentially saying that all Nvidia chips everywhere support the ‘American tech stack’ rather than China rather obviously turning around and using them for their own tech. He explicitly is yelling we need to ‘compete in China’ or else. Complete Obvious Nonsense talking of his own book, which one must remind oneself is indeed his job, what were you really expecting him to say? Well, what he is saying is that the way we ‘lose the AI race’ is someone builds a CUDA alternative or steals Nvidia market share. That his market is what matters. It’s full text. Not remotely a strawman. I would disagree with arguments of form #2 in the strongest possible terms. If it’s arguments of form #1, we can talk about it. We should keep these facts in mind as we analyze the fact that the United States has signed a preliminary chip deal with the UAE. There is a 5GW AUE-US AI campus planned, and is taking similar action in Saudi Arabia. The deals were negotiated by a team led by David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. Lennart Heim: To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi (UAE) into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far. In exchange for access to our chips, we get what are claimed to be strong protections against chip diversion, and promises of what I understand to be a total of $200 billion in investments by the UAE. That dollar figure is counting things like aluminum, petroleum, airplanes, Qualcomm and so on. It is unclear how much of that is new. The part of the deal that matters is that a majority of the UAE investment in data centers has to happen here in America. I notice that I am skeptical that all the huge numbers cited in the various investment ‘deals’ we keep making will end up as actual on-the-ground investments. As in: Walter Bloomberg: UAE PRESIDENT SAYS UAE TO INVEST $1.4T IN U.S OVER NEXT 10 YEARS At best there presumably is some creative accounting and political symbolism involved in such statements. Current UAE foreign-direct-investment stock in the USA is only $38 billion, their combined wealth funds only have $1.9 trillion total. We can at best treat $1.4 trillion as an aspiration, an upper bound scenario. If we get the $200 billion we should consider that a win, although if the deal is effectively ‘all your investments broadly are in the West and not in China’ then that would indeed be a substantial amount of funds. Nor is this an isolated incident. The Administration is constantly harping huge numbers, claiming to have brought in $14 trillion in new investment, including $4 trillion from the recent trip to Arabia, or roughly half of America’s GDP. Jason Furman (top economic advisor, Obama White House): That’s nuts and baseless. I doubt the press releases even add up to that. But, regardless, press releases are a terrible way to determine the investment or the impact of his policies on it. Justin Wolfers: Trump has claimed a $1.2 trillion investment deal from Qatar. Qatar’s annual GDP is a bit less than $250 billion per year. So he’s claiming an investment that would require every dollar every Qatari earned over the next five years. UAE’s MGX will also be opening Europe’s largest data center in France, together with Nvidia, an 8.5 billion Euro investment, first phase to be operational in 2028. This has been in the works for a while. Not that the numbers ultimately matter all that much. What does matter is: How will we ensure the chips don’t fall literally or functionally into Chinese hands? It comes down to the security provisions and who is going to effectively have access to and run all this compute. I don’t see here any laying out of the supposed tough security provisions. Without going into details, if the agreements on both physical and digital security are indeed implemented in a way that is sufficiently tough and robust, if we are the ones who both physically and digitally control and monitor things on a level at least as high as domestically, and can actually have confidence none of this will get diverted, then that goes a long way. We don’t yet have enough of that information to say. The public explanations for the deal, and the public statements about what safety precautions are considered necessary, do not bring comfort. I very much do not like comments like this, made in response to the Bloomberg piece above. David Sacks (US AI Czar): If the concern [about the deal] is about diversion of advanced semiconductors to China, that’s an important policy objective but one that is easily addressed with a security agreement and a “trust but verify” approach. Modern AI supercomputers are 8 feet tall and weigh two tons; these are not like diamonds smuggled in a briefcase. To verify that chips are where they’re supposed to be, an auditor can just visit the data center and count server racks. Semianalysis: As such, physical inspections are key to ensuring the GPUs are where they are supposed to be. The White House is aware of the risks and is prepared to ensure the chips are where they are supposed to be. As Bloomberg reported (quotes David Sacks’s statement above). I’m sorry, what? You can ‘just visit the data center and count server racks’? It terrifies me to see so many people arguing for the deal explicitly saying that this is a good statement, rather than a terrifying statement that we are hoping no one involved in the actual work believes to be true. [Jordan: In 2022 I did a show with Kevin Wolf, the former head of BIS, who mentioned off-hand that there were literally only two people Commerce had in China to do site inspections. Since then BIS’ budget has barely budged and faced DOGE cuts in the early days of this administration. There is not the capacity to do datacenter inspections in a serious way today.] Jordan Schneider: Let's start with the last thing first. This 60-day unverified list: is there a potential that the impact of this could actually be a lot bigger than what we currently see, if some of these big names on the unverified entity list end up graduating to full entity-list status? Kevin Wolf: It's really up to the Chinese government. If they allow access, give the information that the Commerce Department is seeking, and allow the two people in China that do inspections and site visits to do their jobs… Jordan Schneider: Whoa, wait, two? There are, like, 30 firms on there! Kevin Wolf: Yeah, I know, but no other country has any, and the Commerce Department is the only export control organization on the planet with its own enforcement agents who are subject matter experts in export controls. I think diversion via remote access is far more likely than physical diversion, and this response does not address the remote access issue at all, but even simply treating this as a physical diversion issue, o3, is the quoted statement accurate? o3 (full one shot, full response quoted, in response to literally quoting Sacks without attribution and asking ‘is this accurate?’): Short version: Mostly wrong. Chips are tiny and high-value, so diversion is hard to stop with “count the racks.” Physical audits help but they are far from sufficient. High value-to-weight ratio.At ~$30 k per H100, a single 20 kg carry-on full of GPUs is > $1 m. That’s an attractive target. Racks are heavy; the payload isn’t. Modularity.GPUs slide out in minutes. An auditor sees the enclosure; they cannot tell if the trays were swapped yesterday or will be tomorrow. Dummy blanks cost <$10. Front companies & trans-shipping.Chips often leave the compliant data-center before any inspection window. Paperwork shows them installed; reality changes after the auditor flies home. Remote lease risk.Even if the hardware stays in the U.S., Chinese entities can simply rent time on it. Export-control rules treat “deemed exports” (remote access by restricted users) as violations. Limited audit frequency & competence.Meaningful verification requires random, intrusive, technically savvy inspections plus cryptographic attestation of firmware. Counting racks is neither. My best estimate: ≤ 30 % that “security agreement + occasional rack counting” alone keeps advanced GPUs out of China for > 3 years. ≥ 70 % that significant leakage continues absent tighter controls (HW tracking, cryptographic attestation, and supply-chain tagging). So the quoted claim is misleading: rack-level audits are helpful but nowhere near “easily addresses” the diversion problem. When I asked how many chips would likely be diverted from a G42 data center if this was the security regime, o3’s 90% confidence interval was 5%-50%. Note that the G42 data center is 20% of the total compute here, so if we generously assume no physical diversion risk in the other 80%, that’s 1%-10% of all compute we deploy in the UAE. Is that acceptable? The optimal amount of chip diversion is not zero. But I think this level of diversion would be a big deal, and the bigger concern is remote access. I want to presume, for overdetermined reasons, that Sacks’s statement was written without due consideration or it does not reflect his actual views, and we would not actually make this level of dumb mistake where they could literally just swap the chips out for dummy chips. I presume we are planning to use vastly superior and more effective precautions against chip diversion and also have a plan for robust monitoring of compute use to prevent remote access diversion. But how can we trust an administration to take such issues seriously, if their AI Czar is not taking this even a little bit seriously? This is not a one time incident. Similar statements keep coming. That’s why I spent a whole post responding to them. David Sacks is also quoted extensively directly in the Bloomberg piece, and is repeatedly very dismissive of worried about diversion of chips or of compute, saying it is a fake argument and an easy problem to solve, and he talks about these as if they were reliable American allies in ways I do not believe are accurate. Sacks also continues to appear to view winning AI to be largely about selling AI chips. As in, if G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, is using American AI chips, then it essentially ‘counts as American’ for purposes of ‘winning,’ or similar. I don’t think that is how this works, or that this is a good use of a million H100s. Bloomberg reports 80% of chips headed to the UAE would go to US companies, 20% to G42. I very much want us to think about the actual physical consequences of various actions, not what those actions symbolize or look like. I do think, despite everything else, it is a very good sign that David Sacks is ‘urging people to read the fine print.’ This is moderated by the fact that we do not have the fine print, so we can’t read it. The true good news there requires one to read all that fine print, and one also should not assume that the fine print will get implemented. Nor do we yet have access to what the actual fine print says, so we cannot read it. Dylan Patel and others at Semianalysis offer a robust defense of the deal, saying clearly that ‘America wins’ and that this benefits American AI infrastructure suppliers on all levels, including AI labs and cloud providers. They focus on three benefits: money, tying KSA/UAE to our tech stack, and electrical power, and warn of the need for proper security, including model weight security, a point I appreciated them highlighting. Those seem like the right places to focus, and the right questions to ask. How much of their money is really up for grabs and how much does it matter? To what extent does this meaningfully tie UAE/KSA to America and how much does that matter? How much do we need their ability to provide electrical power? How will the security arrangements work, will they be effective, and who will effectively be in charge and have what leverage? Specifically, on their three central points: They call this macro, but a better term would be money. UAE and KSA (Saudi Arabia) can make it rain, a ‘trillion-dollar floodgate.’ This raises two questions. Question one: Was American AI ‘funding constrained’? The big tech companies were already putting in a combined hundreds of billions a year. Companies like xAI can easily raise funds to build giant data centers. If Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft wanted to invest more, are they really about to run out of available funding? Are there enough more chips available to be bought to run us out of cash? Semianalysis seems to think we should be worried about willingness of American companies to invest here and thinks we will have trouble with the financing. I am not convinced of this. Have you seen what these companies (don’t have to) pay on corporate bonds? Did we need to bring in outside investors? Should we even want to, given these investments look likely to pay off? This is a major crux. If indeed American big tech companies are funding constrained in their AI investments, then the money matters a lot more. Whereas if we were already capable of buying up all the chips, that very much cuts the other way. Question two: As we discussed earlier, is the trillion-dollar number real? We keep seeing these eye-popping headline investment numbers, but they don’t seem that anchored to reality, and seem to include all forms of investment including not AI, although of course other foreign direct investment is welcome. Do their investments in US datacenters mean anything, and are they even something we want, given that the limiting factor driving all this is either constraints on chip availability or on electrical power? Will this be crowding out other providers? If these deals are so positive for American tech companies, why didn’t the stock market moves reflect this? No, I will not accept ‘priced in.’ They call this geopolitical, that UAE and KSA are now tied to American technology stacks. As they say, ‘if Washington enforces tight security protocols.’ We will see. David Sacks is explicitly dismissing the need for tight security protocols. Classically, as Trump knows well, when the bank loans you a large enough amount and you don’t pay it back, it is the bank that has the problem. Who is being tied to whose stack? They will be able to at least cut the power any time. It is not clear from public info what other security will be present and what happens if they decide to turn on us, or use that threat as leverage. Can they take our chips and their talents elsewhere? This can almost be looked at as a deal with one corporation. G42 seems like it’s going to effectively be on the UAE side of the deal, and it is going to have a lot of chips in a lot of places. A key question is, to what extent do we have the leverage on and control over G42, and to what extent does this mean they will act as a de facto American tech company and ally? How much can we trust that our interests will continue to align? Who will be dependent on who? Will our security protocols extend to their African and European outposts? Why does buying a bunch of our chips tie them into the rest of our stack? My technical understand is that it doesn’t. They’re only tied to the extent that they agreed to be tied as part of the deal (again, details unknown), and they could swap out that part at any time. In my experience you can change which AI your program uses by changing a few lines of code, and people often do. It is not obvious why KSA and UAE using our software or tech stack is important to us other than because they are about to have all these chips. These aren’t exactly huge markets. If the argument is they have oversized effect on lots of other markets, we need to hear this case made out loud. Seminanalysis points out China doesn’t even have the capacity to sell its own AI chips yet. And I am confused about the perspectives here on ‘market share’ and the implied expectations about customer lock-in. They call this infrastructure, I’d simply call it (electrical) power. This is the clearly valuable thing we are getting. It’s rather crazy that ‘put our most strategic asset except maybe nukes into the UAE and KSA’ was chosen over ‘overrule permitting rules and build some power plants or convince one of our closer allies to do it’ but here we are. So the question here is, what are the alternatives? How acute is the shortage going to be and was there no one else capable of addressing it? Also, even if we do have to make this deal now, this is screaming from the rooftops, we need to build up more electrical power everywhere else now, so we don’t have this constraint again in the future. Semianalysis also raises the concern about model weight security, but essentially think this is solvable via funding work to develop countermeasures and use of red teaming, plus defense in depth. It’s great to see this concern raised explicitly, as it is another real worry. Yes, we could do work to mitigate it and impose good security protocols, and keep the models from running in places and ways that create this danger, but will we? I don’t know. Failure here would be catastrophic. There are also other concerns even if we successfully retain physical and digital control over the chips. The more we place AI chips and other strategic AI assets there, the more we are turning UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Qatar into major AI players, granting them leverage I believe they can and will use for various purposes. David Sacks continues to claim to not understand that others think that ‘winning AI’ is mostly not about who gets to sell chips, who uses our models and picks up market share, or about superficially ‘winning’ ‘deals.’ He not only thinks it is about market penetration, he can’t imagine an alternative. He doesn’t understand that many, including myself, this is about who has compute and who gets superintelligence, and about the need for proper security. David Sacks: I’m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed “China Hawk” can claim that President Trump’s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren’t hugely beneficial for the United States. As leading semiconductor analyst Dylan Patel observed, these deals “will noticeably shift the balance of power” in America’s favor. The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch. Sam Altman: this was an extremely smart thing for you all to do and i’m sorry naive people are giving you grief. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): One Trump administration official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that with the G42 deal, American policymakers were making a choice that could mean the most powerful A.I. training facility in 2029 would be in the United Arab Emirates, rather than the United States. [Jordan: this is a wild line to be giving to the NY Times—I thought all the China hawks already got purged!] But Trump officials worried that if the United States continued to limit the Emirates’ access to American technology, the Persian Gulf nation would try Chinese alternatives. The hawks are concerned, because the hawks largely do not think that the key question is who will get to sell chips, but rather who gets to buy them and use them. This is especially true given that both America and China are producing as many top AI chips as they can, us far more successfully, and there is more than enough demand for both of them. One must think on the margin. Given that so many China hawks are indeed on record doubting this deal, if you are perplexed by this I suggest reading their explanations. Here is one example. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): Mr. Goodrich said the United States still had the best A.I. engineers, companies and chips and should look for ways to speed up permitting and improve its energy grid to hold on to that expertise. Setting up some of the world’s largest data centers in the Middle East risks turning the Gulf States, or even China, into A.I. rivals, he said. “We’ve seen this movie before and we should not repeat it,” Mr. Goodrich said. Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the huge chip sales did “not feel consistent with an America First approach to A.I. policy or industrial policy.” “Why would we want to offshore the infrastructure that will underpin the key industrial technology of the coming years?” he asked. This does not seem like a difficult position to understand? There are of course also other reasons to oppose such deals. Here is Jordan Schneider of China Talk’s response, in which he is having absolutely none of it, explicitly rejecting that either America or China has chips to spare for this. rejecting that UAE and KSA are actual allies, not expecting us to follow through with reasonable security precautions, and saying if we wanted to do this anyway we could have held out for a better deal with more control than this, I don’t know why you would be confused how someone could have this reaction based on the publicly available information: Jordan Schneider: It’s going to cannibalize US build-out and leave the world with three independent power-centers of AI hardware where we could’ve stuck to our guns, done more power generation at home, and only had China to deal with not these wild-card countries that are not actual allies. If this really is as important as we believe, why are we letting these countries and companies we deeply distrust get access to it? The Gulf’s BATNA wasn’t Huawei chips, it was no chips. Whatever we’re trying to negotiate for, we can play harder to get. BIS can just say they can’t buy Ascends and it’s not like there’s enough capacity domestically in China to service global demand absent the TSMC loophole they charged through. Plus, we’re offering to sell them 10× the chips that Huawei could conceivably sell them anytime soon even if they use the TSMC-fabbed wafers. Where’s the art-of-the-deal energy here? Right now I only see AMD and NVDA shareholders as well as Sama benefiting from all of this. I thought we wanted to raise revenue from tariffs? Why not charge 3× the market rate and put the premium into the US Treasury, some “Make America Great Again” industrial-development fund, use it to triple BIS’ budget so they can actually enforce the security side, put them on the hook for Gaza…I don't know literally anything you care about. How about a commitment not to invest in Chinese tech firms? Do we still care about advanced logic made in America? How about we only let them buy chips fabbed in the US, fixing the demand-side problem and forcing NVDA to teach Intel how to not suck. Speaking of charging through loopholes, all of the security issues Dylan raises in his article I have, generously, 15 % confidence in USG being able to resolve/resist industry and politicians when they push back. If it’s so simple to just count the servers, why hasn’t BIS already done it / been able to fight upstream industry lobbying to update the chips-and-SME regs to stop Chinese build-outs and chip acquisition? What happens when the Trump gets a call from the King when some bureaucrat is trying to stop shipments because they see diversion if they ever catch it in the first place? Why are we doing anything with G42 again? Fine, if you really decide you want to sell chips to the UAE, at the very least give American hyperscalers the off-switch. It’s not like they would’ve walked away from that offer! America has a ton to lose in the medium term from creating another cloud provider that can service at scale, saying nothing of one that has some deeply-discomforting China ties pretty obvious even to me sitting here having never gotten classified briefings on the topic. Do the deal’s details and various private or unvoiced considerations make this deal better than it looks and answer many of these concerns? Could this be sufficient that, if looked at purely through the lens of American strategic interests, this deal was a win versus the salient alternatives? Again: That is all certainly possible! Our negotiating position could have been worse than Jordan believes. We could have gotten important things for America we aren’t mentioning yet. The administration could have limited room to maneuver including by being divided against itself or against Congress on this. On the flip side, there are some potentially uncharitable explanations for all of this, that would be reasonable to consider. Instead of understanding and engaging with such concerns and working to allay them, Sacks has repeatedly decided to make this a mask off moment, and engage in a response that I would expect on something like the All-In Podcast or in a Twitter beef, but which is unbecoming of his office and responsibilities, with multiple baseless vibe and ad hominem attacks at once that reflect that he either is willfully ignorant of the views, goals and beliefs of those he is attacking and even who they actually are, or he is lying and does not care, or both, and a failure to take seriously the concerns and objections being raised. Here is another illustration of this: David Sacks (May 17): After the Sam Bankrun-Fraud fiasco, it was necessary for the Effective Altruists to rebrand. So they are trying to position themselves as “China Hawks.” But their tech deceleration agenda is the same, and it would cost America the AI race with China. There are multiple other people I often disagree with on important questions but whom I greatly respect who are working on in administration on AI policy. There are good arguments you can make in defense of this deal. Instead of making those arguments in public, we repeatedly get this. Everything Sacks says seems to be about vibes and implications first and actual factual claims a distant second at best. He doesn’t logically say ‘all so-called China hawks who don’t agree with me are secret effective altruists in trench coats and also decels who hate all technology and all of humanity and also America,’ but you better believe that’s the impression he’s going for here. Would China have preferred to ‘do this deal’ instead? That at best assumes facts, and arguments, not in evidence. It depends what they would get out of such a deal, and what we’re getting out of ours, and also the security arrangements and whether we’ve formed a long lasting relationship in which we hold the cards. I’m also not even sure what it would mean for China to have ‘done this deal,’ it does not have what we are offering. Semianalysis says they don’t have similar quantities of chips to sell, and might not have any, nor are their chips of similar quality. I do agree China would have liked to ‘do a deal’ in some general sense, where they bring UAE/KSA into their orbit, on AI and otherwise, although they don’t need access to electrical power. More capital and friends are always helpful. It’s not clear what that deal would have looked like. [Jordan: the fact that the administration is citing some old news of Huawei promising to gift just $75m in chips to the Malaysian government (and not even today! Over two years!) is policy malpractice. Plus, this administration just made clear that using Huawei Ascend chips violates US export controls, giving America an enormously powerful lever to dissuade fence-sitting countries not to buy into what is already an inferior tech offering.] Here’s Tyler Cowen being clear eyed about some of what we are selling so cheap. The most powerful AI training facility could be in the UAE, and you’re laughing? Tyler Cowen: Of course Saudi and the UAE have plenty of energy, including oil, solar, and the ability to put up nuclear quickly. We can all agree that it might be better to put these data centers on US territory, but of course the NIMBYs will not let us build at the required speeds. Not doing these deals could mean ceding superintelligence capabilities to China first. Or letting other parties move in and take advantage of the abilities of the Gulf states to build out energy supplies quickly. Energy and ability to overcome NIMBYs is only that which is scarce because America is refusing to rise to this challenge and actually enable more power generation. Seriously, is there nowhere in America we can make this happen at scale? If we wanted to, we could do this ourselves easily. We have the natural gas, even if nuclear would be too slow to come online. It is a policy choice not to clear the way. And no, I see zero evidence that we are pulling out the stops here and coming up short. I think this frame is exactly correct - that this deal makes sense if and only if all of: The security deal is robust and we retain functional control over where the compute goes. We trust our friends here to remain our friends at a reasonable price. We counterfactually would not have been able to buy these chips and build data centers to power these chips. As far as I can tell China already has all the power it needs to power any AI chips it can produce, it is using them all, and its chip efforts are not funding constrained. So for want of electrical power, and for a few dollars, we are handing over a large amount of influence over the future to authoritarian powers with very different priorities and values? Tyler Cowen: In any case, imagine that soon the world’s smartest and wisest philosopher will soon again be in Arabic lands. We seem to be moving to a world where there will be four major AI powers — adding Saudi and UAE — rather than just two, namely the US and China. But if energy is what is scarce here, perhaps we were headed for additional AI powers anyway, and best for the US to be in on the deal? Who really will have de facto final rights of control in these deals? Plug pulling abilities? What will the actual balance of power and influence look like? Exactly what role will the US private sector play? Will Saudi and the UAE then have to procure nuclear weapons to guard the highly valuable data centers? Will Saudi and the UAE simply become the most powerful and influential nations in the Middle East and perhaps somewhat beyond? Yes. Those are indeed many of the right questions, once you think security is solid. Who is in charge of these data centers in the ways that matter? Won’t they at minimum have the ability to cut the power at any time? Who gets to decide where the compute goes? What are they going to do with all this leverage we are handing them? Is this what it means to have the future be based on American or Democratic values? Do you like ‘the values’ of the UAE and Saudi Arabian authorities? Tyler Cowen: I don’t have the answers to those questions. If I were president I suppose I would be doing these deals, but it is very difficult to analyze all of the relevant factors. The variance of outcomes is large, and I have very little confidence in anyone’s judgments here, my own included. Few people are shrieking about this, either positively or negatively, but it could be the series of decisions that settles our final opinion of the second Trump presidency. The administration thinks that the compute in question will remain under the indefinitely control of American tech companies, to be directed as we wish. Sriram Krishnan: Reflecting on what has been an amazing week and a key step in global American AI dominance under President Trump. These Middle East AI partnerships are historic and this “AI diplomacy” will help lock in the American tech stack in the region, help American companies expand there while also building infrastructure back in the U.S to continue expanding our compute capacity. This happens on top of rigorous security guarantees to stop diversion or unauthorized access of our technology. More broadly this helps pull the region closer to the U.S and aligns our technological interests in a very key moment for AI. It’s a very exciting moment and a key milestone. I hope that they are right about this, but I notice that I share Tyler’s worry that they are wrong. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Humain is going to get ‘several hundred thousand’ of Nvidia’s most advanced processors, starting with 18k GB300 Grace Blackwells. The justification given for rescinding the Biden diffusion rules is primarily that failure to do this would have ‘weakened diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.’ But, well, not to reiterate everything I said last week, but on that note I have news. One, we’re weakening diplomatic relations with essentially all countries in a series of unforced errors elsewhere, and we could stop. [Jordan: that feeling when you treat Dubai better than Canada] Two, most of the listed tier two countries have always had second-tier status. There’s a reason Saudi Arabia isn’t in Five Eyes or NATO. We can talk price about which countries should have which status, but no our relations are not all created equal, not when it comes to strategically vital national interests and to deep trust. I don’t share Sacks’s stated view that these are some of our closest and most trustworthy allies. Why does this administration seem to always want to make its deals mostly with authoritarian regimes, usually in places where Trump has financial ties? Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NY Times): The announcements of the two deals follow reports that $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies over the last month from the Middle East, including a Saudi-backed investment in Trump’s cryptocurrency and plans for a new presidential airplane from Qatar. There’s always Trust But Verify. The best solution, if you can’t trust, is often to set up things so that you don’t have to. This can largely be done. Will we do it? And what will we get in return? What is announced mostly seems to be investments and purchases, that what we are getting are dollars, and Bloomberg is skeptical of the stated dollar amounts. This deal is very much not a first best solution. It is, at best, a move that we are forced into on the margin due to our massive unforced errors in a variety of other realms. Even if it makes sense to do this, it makes even more sense to be addressing and fixing those other critical mistakes. Electrical power is the most glaring in the context of this particular. There needs to be national emergency level focus on America’s inability to build electrical power capacity. Where are the special compute zones? Where are the categorical exemptions? Where is DOGE with regard to the NRC? Where is the push for real reform on any of these fronts? Instead, we see story after story of Congress actively moving to withdraw even the supports that are already there, including plans to outright abrogate contracts on existing projects. The other very glaring issue is trade policy. If we think it is this vital to maintain trade alliances and open up markets, and maintaining market share, why are we otherwise going in the opposite direction? Why are we alienating most of our allies? And so on. The argument for this deal is, essentially, that it must be considered in isolation. That other stuff is someone else’s department, and we can only work with what we have. But this is a very bitter pill to be asked to swallow, especially as Sacks himself has spoken out quite loudly in favor of many of those same anti-helpful policies, and the others he seems to be sitting out. You can argue that he needs to maintain his political position, but if that also rules out advocating for electrical power generation and permitting reform, what are we even doing? If we swallow the entire pill, and consider these deals only on the margin, without any ability to impact any of our other decisions, and only with respect to ‘beating China’ and ability to ‘win the AI race,’ and assume fully good faith and set aside all the poor arguments and consider only the steelman case, we can ask: Do these deals help us? I believe that such a deal is justifiable, again on the margin and regarding our position with respect to China, if and only if ALL of the following are true: Security arrangements are robust, the chips actually do remain under our physical control and we actually do determine what happens with the compute. And things are set up such that America retains the leverage, and we can count on UAE/KSA to remain our friends going forward. This was essentially the best deal we could have gotten. This represents a major shift in our or China’s ability to stand up advanced AI chips, because for the bulk of these chips either Big Tech would have run out of money, or we would have been unable to source the necessary electrical power, or China has surplus advanced AI chips I was not previously aware of and no way to deploy them. Entering into these partnerships is more diplomatically impactful, and these friendships are more valuable, than they appear to me based on public info. ChinaTalk is a reader-supported publication.

I spent two years in a China Studies master’s program. It was fun reading Dream of the Red Chamber and Xi speeches — but I really wish I had come out of it with some hard skills, too. Had I only known about the University of San Francisco’s new Master of Science in Applied Economics Excellent commentary. I'm increasingly baffled by the inconsistencies in how the administration views AI. On one hand, it's the most important technology of the century, and will definitively decide the outcome of the U.S.-China competition. Yet we're willing to outsource and offshore data center development. I realize the analogy is flawed, but it has the same feeling as saying we want to outsource production of the B-21 because we have too many regulations, it will take too long to get permits and build, we can't afford it, and BTW we'll be able to provide oversight and monitoring of the manufacturing plant. Not something we would do in a million years. So if AI is that critical, why would we ever agree to this chip sales/data center deal--purported to result in what will become the largest cluster in the world? (While cutting BIS resources.) Rather than being about national self-interests, this has all the earmarks of a pure transactional agreement, centered on money and power. And while it's easy to be skeptical of the claims about AGI and ASI, if the assertion is that AI is going to be the most powerful, game-changing tech of the century, why should we ever stop states from trying to implement reasonable oversight and regulations? The states are doing it because there's a major gap at the federal level. The hyperbolic claims about over-regulation of AI during the previous administration are belied by the facts on the ground. In reality, the previous EOs directed very little regulation, outside mandating a number of actions within the government itself. I'm all for smart, tailored, less intrusive regulations. But it's really hard to justify scant or no regulatory actions, at the same time the administration is arguing that this technology will forever change the world. We're trying to create another Taiwan we have to protect lol No posts Ready for more?

Title: Bond Yields & Stocks: Something’s Happening Here

Time Published: 2025-05-25T12:24:45Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in US Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year US Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds US government bond yields in the US have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the North has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the US has seen slightly lower yields! 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the US currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the US dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The US dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker US dollar do not uniformly lead to higher US Treasury bond yields. US Dollar Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend. Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union (EU) issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The US House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the US fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The US Senate will almost certainly make some changes, so the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the US and global economy. President Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in US Treasury yields does not point to a US-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the US is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

With the bond-market selloff spooking investors across the board, stocks finished last week in the red. The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all fell. Disappointing retail data kept piling up, too, with Target’s earnings portraying a sharp drop in confidence among middle and high-income households, while Home Depot and Lowe’s showed a slowdown in home renovations. New data released by the National Association of Realtors added to the drama, as existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million in April — down 0.5% from March and 2.4% from a year ago. Now investors are set to return from Memorial Day barbecues to a shorter yet still jam-packed week. Here’s what to watch: U.S. markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. Tuesday kicks off the shortened trading week with a batch of earnings that should offer fresh data into how American consumers are faring — and feeling. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ+0.59%) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM-0.29%) both report before the bell. Analysts will be watching BJ’s for any signs of trading-down behavior or shrinking basket sizes, both windows into customers’ confidence levels. Okta (OKTA-0.92%) also reports Tuesday, with analysts expecting positive earnings vs. a quarterly loss this time last year. Wednesday is the marquee day of the week, with heavyweight earnings from Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), the third-largest company in America by market cap, as well as Salesforce (CRM-0.74%) and Veeva Systems (VEEV-0.13%), plus the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s report after the bell will surely be the most closely watched: The chipmaker has become a virtual stand-in for the AI wave and global chip war, and analysts are predicting as much as a 7% move in the price. Also after market close, Salesforce will offer updates on enterprise software spending amid growing economic uncertainty. Veeva will shed light on cloud-based trends in pharma and biotech. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS-3.06%) is also set to report. The biggest macro flashpoint comes at 2:00 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May 6-7 meeting. No surprises are expected, but with investors speculating whether rate cuts might come in the second half of 2025, you can expect articles analyzing the log for any insight into inflation, the labor market, or internal dissent. Costco (COST-0.22%), Dell, Zscaler (ZS+0.24%), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA-0.04%) all report Thursday. Investors will be watching Costco for traffic trends, membership retention, and its food versus discretionary sales mix, especially given Walmart’s (WMT+0.77%) recent gains in grocery. Ulta Beauty’s report will portray the health of mascara and shampoo spending — areas that often remain surprisingly strong even when consumers pull back in other categories. Gotta keep those highlights looking fresh, no matter the macro outlook. Dell Technologies (DELL-3.07%) and Zscaler round out the day’s marquee tech names. Dell’s outlook will be read for enterprise PC refresh cycles and demand for AI-capable hardware, while Zscaler’s earnings will offer a look at corporate cybersecurity priorities in an atmosphere of belt-tightening. With no major economic releases or U.S.-listed heavyweights reporting, Friday may make for a quieter session — a nice little reprieve after the flurry of earnings and macro headlines. Only Up Fintech (TIGR-0.42%), a large China-based brokerage firm, is scheduled to report. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Seattle-based ElastixAI, founded just months ago by veteran engineers behind Apple's AAPL $200 million acquisition of Xnor, has raised $16 million from top-tier investors, including Bellevue-based capital venture company FUSE. The stealth-mode startup with elite Apple pedigree is quietly tackling one of the most expensive pain points in artificial intelligence deployment: inference, GeekWire reports. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The founding team behind ElastixAI is no stranger to cutting-edge AI. According to GeekWire, CEO Mohammad Rastegari was co-founder and chief technology officer of Xnor, which was acquired by Apple in 2020 for its groundbreaking edge-based AI tools. He spent four years at Apple following the acquisition and most recently served as a distinguished scientist at Meta META. Rastegari is also an affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington and spent five years at the Allen Institute for AI, co-founded by the late Microsoft MSFT visionary Paul Allen, GeekWire says. Chief technology officer Saman Naderiparizi, who led hardware engineering at Xnor, was also a senior engineering manager at Apple. He's joined by third co-founder Mahyar Najibi, a former Apple engineer who also spent time at Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, GeekWire reports. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. While training AI models gets most of the headlines, inference is where the real-world costs pile up. According to TechTarget, every time a chatbot generates or replies to a question, a recommendation system suggests a new item or a smart device reacts to a real-world prompt, the model is performing inference. These post-deployment processes happen at scale and in real time, often thousands or millions of times a day. That volume drives up compute costs, latency concerns, and energy consumption. GeekWire says that ElastixAI is focused on flexibility and configurability, giving enterprises and hyperscalers the ability to tune their inference infrastructure to specific needs. Whether running on edge devices or large cloud environments, the company's software-centric platform is designed to reduce both compute load and operational cost. “We saw a gap when it comes to delivering AI inference at scale and at low cost,” Rastegari told GeekWire. The startup remains in stealth, but its positioning puts it in conversation with major players like Nvidia NVDA, Coreweave CRWV, and inference-focused startups such as Fireworks.ai and Together.ai, GeekWire says. See Also: Be part of the next med-tech breakthrough for only $350 — 500+ surgeries already done with nView's AI system. The $16 million round includes participation from Catapult, Tyche Partners, Liquid 2 Ventures, and DNX Ventures, according to GeekWire. Cameron Borumand, general partner at FUSE, told GeekWire the firm was "thrilled to back the elite technical founders at Elastix to solve the hardest problems around scaling compute and infrastructure in the fast-growing AI inference market." The company is also well-placed within Seattle's booming AI scene. With Apple's growing presence in the region and continued investment in foundational technologies, ElastixAI has access to both talent and infrastructure, according to GeekWire. As AI demand continues to surge, inference platforms are becoming critical infrastructure. ElastixAI's unique combination of flexibility, leadership, and investor confidence may position it as one of the most closely watched stealth startups of the future.

Title: Tesla stock gets a huge price-target hike as Wedbush hails 'golden age of autonomous growth'

Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER+0.83%) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU-2.13%) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Watch These IonQ Price Levels After Quantum Stock Soared 37% on Thursday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ionq-price-levels-after-quantum-stocks-37-percent-rise-on-thursday-11740681
Time Published: 2025-05-23T03:15:00Z
Full Content:
IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday to lead quantum computing stocks higher as the company’s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron’s in an interview that the company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,” asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced the launch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street’s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet that quantum computing will revolutionize areas like drug discovery, cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched 200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within a rising wedge before staging a volume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday’s trading session. While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could trigger short-term profit-taking. Let’s identify two key overhead areas on IonQ’s chart to watch amid the stock’s recent buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $55. Investors who have accumulated shares during the rising wedge could look for exit points at this level near the stock’s all-time high. To forecast an upside price target above the all-time high, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the technique to IonQ’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s uptrend from November to January and reposition them from today’s breakout point. This analysis projects a target of around $100, about 120% above Thursday’s closing price. We selected this prior move higher as it commenced following a one-day gain of around 35%, similar to Thursday’s percentage change. It's also worth noting that trend played out over 40 trading days, meaning a similar move from the current breakout could last until late July if price action rhymes. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $28 level. This area on the chart finds support from the nearby rising 50-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last November. Finally, selling below this level could see IonQ shares revisit lower support around $18. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near the late-October peak and early-March trough.

Title: Kraken to offer tokenized securities, including Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia, to customers outside the U.S

U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken Partners, has partnered with Backed, a leading issuer of tokenized stocks, and the Solana Foundation to bring tokenized U.S. equities to investors worldwide. According to a company press release, Backed will initially deploy SPL-based digital representations of U.S.-listed stocks (including Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Tesla (TSLA-3.33%), and Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%)) and ETFs on the Solana blockchain. These tokenized assets will soon be available to eligible Kraken clients in select non-U.S. markets directly through the Kraken app. Under the Trump administration, the regulatory environment has become more favorable for companies like Kraken. In March, Trump’s SEC dismissed its case against crypto exchange Kraken, which was accused of combining the roles of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without registering securities. Matthew Ruley, director of content for dypto-crypto, a crypto information site, said that by offering assets in non-U.S. markets, Kraken is doing some “alpha testing” so they’re ready to go the second they’re given the green light to begin in the United States. Meanwhile, Dave Weisberger, co-founder at crypto strategy firm CoinRoutes said Kraken’s move is one more way to make crypto available to the masses. “It brings fully transparent access to investing in U.S. stocks to all geographies Kraken operates in. It likely will be available at a much lower cost than GDRs (Global depository receipts) which are offered institutionally today,” Weisberger said, adding that, if successful, this may be seen as the first step towards the mass tokenization of equities. And if that happens, Weisberger predicts lower trading costs, improved liquidity and streamlined operational functions. Other stakeholders also lauded the news. “This is a big moment. Tokenized stocks on Solana mean everyday investors can finally access U.S. equities without being gated by geography, legacy systems, or slow settlement,” says Mike Cahill, CEO of Doura Labs. Cahill says that Kraken and Backed are pushing the market forward by proving that public equities can move at internet speed. “It goes way beyond more efficient—this is about making it more open, accessible, and real-time.” — Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

A group of global tech giants gathered in Abu Dhabi to pose for a photo as an AI supergroup, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s (ORCL-0.97%) Larry Ellison, Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) Jensen Huang, and Chuck Robbins of Cisco (CSCO-0.12%), along with their new UAE partners. They were gathered to launch Stargate UAE, an AI infrastructure 1-gigawatt compute cluster located in the Persian Gulf country. This comes a week after President Trump visited the region and signed an agreement to build the largest AI campus outside the U.S., with a total 5-gigawatt capacity, of which Stargate will be a part. The Trump deal would also give the UAE access to advanced Nvidia chips, as many as 500,000, according to Reuters. In the closing days of the Biden administration, it contemplated denying the country access to American chips due to UAE’s close ties with China. In particular, key Stargate partner G42 was considered a serious security threat by the CIA in 2023. Trump’s team had no such concerns. G42 CEO Peng Xiao said in the press release that “this initiative is about building a bridge —rooted in trust and ambition — that helps bring the benefits of AI to economies, societies, and people around the world.” Stargate UAE is an extension of a project announced in January by OpenAI with Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and others, as a massive investment in AI infrastructure. OpenAI’s Sam Altman said it would also “provide strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.” One of the many funders in the American Stargate is the UAE fund MGX. Microsoft was not listed as a partner in the UAE campus. Stargate U.S. plans to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in America. No price tag has yet been attached to the UAE campus. The facility, spanning 10-square miles in Abu Dhabi, will “be powered by nuclear, solar, and natural gas to minimize carbon emissions,” said the press release.

Title: Forget tariffs: These are the next fronts in the trade war

Time Published: 2025-05-22T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. and China have stepped back from tariff brinkmanship for now — but don’t mistake handshakes for harmony. The real trade fight is just beginning, and it’s moving into murkier terrain: microchips, AI infrastructure, and data sovereignty. And neither side is going to back down from the fierce contest over who controls the future of technology. While tariffs still loom large, both sides have agreed to a temporary ceasefire and a framework to bring sky-high levies back down to earth. But the next front in the trade war isn’t about crates of soybeans or textile factories. It’s about who owns the rails of tomorrow’s digital economy — and who gets boxed out. The U.S. and China have been circling — and increasingly clashing over — critical AI technologies for roughly a decade. Washington has heightened controls on semiconductor exports, limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips and pressuring allies to follow suit. Beijing is doubling down on self-reliance, retaliating with restrictions on critical minerals and squeezing the parts of the supply chain it still dominates. “There are a lot of issues [the trade framework] doesn’t address,” Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, said in an interview. “The tech tensions are going to be a very high priority.” The Trump administration recently rolled back the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which regulated global distribution of advanced AI technology — a move praised by top CEOs that has cracked open a lucrative market for U.S. tech giants. Now, companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) are cleared to ship millions of high-performance GPUs to countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, supercharging those nations’ ambitions to become regional AI powerhouses. The moves into the Middle East contrast starkly with Washington’s approach toward China. Since 2022, the U.S. has been methodically severing Beijing’s access to the most advanced semiconductors and the tools needed to manufacture them, targeting the building blocks of AI and next-gen military systems. Those export controls, first implemented under President Joe Biden, have continued to varying degrees in President Donald Trump’s second administration. Now, the scope of restrictions is poised to widen. Policymakers in Washington are weighing measures that go beyond simply blocking hardware sales and moving into the realm of research and collaboration. That includes monitoring cloud infrastructure partnerships, joint academic projects, and potential third-country workarounds. China isn’t swinging back with blunt instruments like tariffs. It’s opting for precision hits. Late last year, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals such as gallium and germanium — both vital for chipmaking and EV production. And behind the scenes, China is pouring billions into building its tech lifeboat. The country’s top chipmakers — such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) — are quietly expanding capacity, even under the weight of U.S. export controls. China’s leadership knows that even if the country can’t leapfrog the U.S. in the near term, it can at least build a parallel tech ecosystem — one resilient enough to survive sanctions, export bans, or a full-scale decoupling. No two companies better illustrate the stakes and asymmetries than China’s Huawei and America’s Nvidia. Huawei has become the face of China’s tech ambitions — and of U.S. attempts to stifle them. Last week, the Commerce Department warned that Huawei’s Ascend chips are subject to sweeping export controls. Then, China warned Tuesday that the move “seriously undermined the consensus” that the two countries reached when they agreed to pause tariffs, suggesting China might retaliate. Huawei, long seen as the face of China’s tech rise, was hit hard by U.S. sanctions in 2019. But, denied access to U.S. chips and software, the company didn’t fold — it pivoted. It partnered with SMIC to develop chips for its Mate 60 Pro smartphones and is now pushing its Ascend AI chips as homegrown alternatives to Nvidia’s. Huawei’s chips aren’t on par with Nvidia’s, but they’re part of Beijing’s “tech independence” push. Meanwhile, Nvidia, whose high-end GPUs power almost every leading AI model, has become a geopolitical linchpin. The U.S. has repeatedly restricted its ability to sell to China, citing military concerns. Now, Nvidia walks a tightrope: maintaining global dominance while complying with U.S. restrictions. How Washington treats Nvidia is a window into the Trump administration’s broader strategy. The U.S. wants to preserve Nvidia’s status without letting China piggyback on it. Huawei and Nvidia are mirrored chess pieces in this larger game. The chip war is about hardware, but the software battle is just as critical. The U.S. leads in large foundation models, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others training massive models on U.S.-based infrastructure. These are tightly controlled via APIs and export rules — a “controlled openness” approach designed to balance innovation with national security. OpenAI is the crown jewel of the U.S. AI stack — not just because it makes ChatGPT, but because it helped kick off an AI arms race in which the rest of the world is scrambling to catch up. But China is countering with open-source models, the most notable being DeepSeek, from China’s Moonshot AI, which rattled Silicon Valley earlier this year. By releasing training weights and model architecture, DeepSeek sidesteps export restrictions and helps build domestic capacity. DeepSeek and OpenAI offer a compelling contrast in how China and the U.S. are positioning themselves in the next phase of the tech war: not just around chips and hardware, but around AI capabilities, open-source strategy, and control of foundational models. When DeepSeek’s “R1” model dropped early this year, it stunned the market. Despite running on less powerful hardware, it achieved performance levels that were previously thought to be exclusive to U.S. firms. Nvidia stock dropped 18% in a day — a $589 billion market cap loss — reflecting investor fear that efficient models could reduce the demand for high-end GPUs. But what makes DeepSeek especially important is that it shows China is adapting, not just reacting. “If each nation’s current trajectory holds … the battle for AI supremacy will be fought not between the United States and China, but between high-tech Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Hangzhou,” Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, wrote recently in The New York Times. As AI becomes the backbone of national competitiveness, who owns the data — where it’s stored, how it’s governed, and who gets to access it — is turning into a geopolitical fault line. For the U.S., the concern is clear: Sensitive data flowing to China is a national security risk. That’s why Biden, and now Trump again, pushed forward a suite of export controls and executive orders aimed at walling off U.S. citizens’ data from potential misuse abroad. The logic is that data is power, and in the AI era, leaking it is leaking leverage. But China was ahead of the curve. Since 2017, it has required all foreign firms operating in China to store data locally and undergo cybersecurity reviews. Cross-border data transfers are tightly restricted. In response, some multinationals have built parallel “data bunkers” in China to maintain compliance. The result: a splintered internet. Data once flowed freely across borders, but it’s now increasingly fenced in by digital walls. For global companies, navigating this minefield means balancing privacy laws, national security concerns, and market access. For countries, it’s about who trains the best models, who sets the standards — and who stays in control. The stakes go far beyond privacy. In an age of foundation models and AI training loops, data is the new oil, and sovereignty is about control of the refinery. Both Washington and Beijing know that the side with the best data will train the best models — and that whoever controls the pipelines controls the future. Both Washington and Beijing are playing to win. The U.S. is pressuring allies to block China’s access to advanced chipmaking tools. China, meanwhile, is financing Huawei-built telecom infrastructure in “One Belt, One Road” countries (China’s global infrastructure aimed initiative at connecting Asia, Europe, and beyond), pushing Chinese data standards in international bodies, and expanding RMB-based digital payments. Caught in the middle are U.S. allies that trade heavily with China but rely on Washington for security. Some are hedging, adjusting policies without picking sides. But in a world where every cloud server and chip fab is a potential battleground, neutrality is becoming harder to maintain. This next phase of the U.S.-China economic conflict is less about what’s being traded — and more about who gets to write the rules of the digital future. Because this isn’t just a trade war anymore. It’s a contest for the 21st century. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
