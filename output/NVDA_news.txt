We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Weekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a "crushing response" to Israel's strikes. Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. "Trump trades" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. "Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023," Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees "tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a "bitcoin national stockpile" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Read more here. Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output. Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — "a bit above typical" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: "The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible." Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. "Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC "erred" in its ruling, adding the company is "evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions." Talen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Perplexity, an AI search company, wants you to use artificial intelligence to track election results. The company launched its Election Information Hub on Friday to offer AI-generated answers to questions you have about elections. The hub provides summaries of candidates and their policies — with somewhat vague descriptions — and offers information about local ballot initiatives. “People deserve a clear, easy way to find the information they seek, and few topics are as consequential as elections,” the company said in a statement. “We want to do our part to support an informed electorate, so we’ve built the election hub on Perplexity’s answer engine: an entry point for understanding key issues, voting intelligently, and tracking election results.” The company told The Verge it’s partnering with the Associated Press and Democracy Works to gather its data, and Perplexity cites Wikipedia in many of its entries. “We selected domains that are non-partisan and fact-checked, including Ballotpedia and news organizations. We’re actively monitoring our systems to ensure that we continue to prioritize these sources when answering election-related queries,” Perplexity’s spokesperson said. The company, which has backing from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA+2.79%), has previously been accused in a WIRED investigation of: making things up, often inaccurately summarizing topics, and even attributing fake quotes to real people. WIRED dubbed the site a “bullshit machine.” But Perplexity believes its election hub will not have similar problems. “We want to make it as simple as possible to receive trusted, easy-to-understand information to inform your voting decisions,” the company said. “For each response, you can view the sources that informed an answer, allowing you to dive deeper and verify referenced materials.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Dow drops 200 points as investors brace for Election Day

On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 200 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility. By afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 203 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.16% and 0.10%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR+23.51%) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Nvidia (NVDA+2.79%) shares rose over 1% on Monday as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.55%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.40%) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL+0.62%) and Bank of America (BAC+1.40%), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: A Nvidia partner's stock surged because Nvidia wants chips faster

An Nvidia (NVDA+2.79%) partner in South Korea saw its shares surge Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker wants chips faster. SK Hynix’s South Korea–listed shares closed up almost 6.5% after SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won told reporters that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the company to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. Chey, speaking at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, added that Nvidia is still struggling to fulfill chip demand but that the two are working together on the shortage, Bloomberg reported. Huang requested that SK Hynix provide samples of its HBM4 chips earlier than expected, Chey said. In October, SK Hynix said it expected to supply customers with the new HBM chip, which Nvidia needs for its artificial intelligence chips, by the second half of 2025. Chey said both Nvidia and SK Hynix “are on the same page” about HBM4’s schedule, according to Bloomberg. The South Korea-based chipmaker’s shares are up 37.1% so far this year. The company also unveiled a 16-layer HBM3E at the summit that it said will be with customers early next year. SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said the company will release the next-generation HBM5 and HBM5E sometime between 2028 and 2030. In October, SK Hynix reported record revenue, operating profit, and net profit, “achieving best-ever quarterly performance” in the third quarter on demand for its memory chips for AI technology. “SK Hynix has solidified its position as the world’s No.1 AI memory company by achieving the highest business performance ever in the third quarter of this year,” Kim Woohyun, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said in a statement. “We will continue to maximize profitability while securing stable revenues by taking flexible product and supply strategies in line with market demand.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia is about to replace Intel in the Dow

Nvidia (NVDA+2.79%) shares rose 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.55%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Nvidia, often hailed as an “AI darling,” has seen substantial gains throughout the year, driven by its advancements in AI chip technology. The company’s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming year, bolstered by expanding interest and investment in artificial intelligence — a field where Nvidia remains a clear leader. Nvidia’s in-demand Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s most advanced generative AI models, have propelled the company to record-high quarterly results and a $3 trillion valuation. The chipmaker’s next-generation Blackwell AI chip platform was launched in March and has seen a large surge in demand. The stock split Nvidia announced earlier this year also boosted popularity and growth. The company’s share price has surged by 173% so far this year — and by 193% in the past year. In the past five years, the stock has seen an astronomical 2,498% rise. In contrast, Intel has lagged in the AI boom and missed key opportunities. For example, Intel decided to pass on investing in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, which has since revolutionized AI applications and reached a valuation of around $80 billion. Intel’s stock has suffered, dropping over 53% this year alone, highlighting the challenges the company faces as it tries to catch up with more agile competitors such as Nvidia.

High home prices, elevated borrowing costs and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other countries said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Title: NVIDIA Starts Diverting Orders Away From Super Micro Computer (SMCI) As A Potential Delisting And DOJ Investigation Loom Large

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is NVIDIA's third-largest customer. Additionally, in what is a testament to the heretofore symbiotic relationship between these two entities, SMCI's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. Now, however, it appears that NVIDIA has had enough of Super Micro Computer's near-constant headaches, and is deliberately trying to create some much-needed distance. *NVIDIA HAS BEGUN REDIRECTING ORDERS FROM SUPER MICRO COMPUTER TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS $NVDA $SMCI $DELL $HPE — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) November 4, 2024 To wit, Digi Times is reporting today that NVIDIA has begun redirecting its orders that were originally placed with Super Micro Computer to other suppliers. This development comes as SMCI is now contending with allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, the exodus of its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Super Micro Computer's travails began in August when Hindenburg Research detailed instances of alleged accounting fraud and corporate governance malfeasance in a detailed report. SMCI then delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, presumably in a bid to undertake an internal review. Do note that under the prevailing statutory requirements, SMCI's annual report had to be filed by the 30th of August. Meanwhile, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. As per Hindenburg Research's anecdotes, Super Micro Computer engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. Finally, do note that the Nasdaq exchange recently warned Super Micro Computer of a potential de-listing action should it fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. That punitive action could come as soon as the 20th of November. Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post earlier today, Super Micro Computer has negotiated major changes to its loan agreement with Cathay Bank, with the firm now required to furnish audited financial statements by the 31st of December as opposed to the earlier covenant, which posited the 28th of October as the deadline for furnishing these financial documents.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: End Of An Era: NVIDIA Replaces Intel In The Dow Jones Index

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel was one of only two tech stocks - the other being Microsoft - to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the dot-com bubble of the 90s. Chronic under performance, however, has consequences, and Intel is now being replaced with the poster child of the ongoing AI mania, NVIDIA, within the iconic index. $NVDA, $INTC [Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel] — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) November 1, 2024 To wit, we had noted about a month back that Intel was likely to get booted off the Dow Jones index as part of its upcoming rebalancing. Bear in mind that the DJIA rebalances quarterly, when stocks are added or removed systematically from the market cap-weighed index based on an extensive criteria. Now, that prognostication has panned out, with NVIDIA replacing Intel within the benchmark index. Of course, this development comes as Intel is showing nascent signs of stabilization. For the third quarter of 2024, Intel not only exceeded Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate but also provided a relatively upbeat guidance. However, the stock's initial euphoric reaction was tempered by the qualifier given by Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, within the ensuing earnings call, wherein he conceded that the uptake of the AI accelerator Gaudi 3 was "slower than expected" and, therefore, the chipmaker would miss its $500 Million initial target for AI Accelerators. Of course, as we reported recently, Amazon has now emerged as the anchor customer for Intel's chip fabrication ambitions. In the first phase of their planned collaboration, the chipmaker will leverage its "Intel 3" process to build a custom Xeon 6 chip for Amazon's data center workloads. In the second phase, the company will produce an "AI fabric chip" for Amazon's AWS on its 18A manufacturing process, which is compatible with TSMC's 2nm process and is expected to enter the commercial phase in 2025. Meanwhile, Intel is still waiting for the Biden Administration to start releasing the grants and loans that were promised under the CHIPS Act.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Intel will lose its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a 25-year run to Nvidia, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday, the latest blow to the struggling chipmaker that was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel’s shares (INTC) have declined 54% this year, making it the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. The stock fell about 1% in extended trading on Friday, while Nvidia (NVDA) was up 1.5%. Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company’s shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia’s graphics processors, the company is now the second-most valuable in the world and is seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company’s 10-for-one stock split in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders.

Title: Nvidia to replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) will be replaced by Nvidia (NVDA) on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index after a 25-year run, underscoring the shift in the chipmaking market and marking another setback for the struggling semiconductor firm. Nvidia will join the index next week along with paint-maker Sherwin-Williams , which will replace Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel's shares have declined 54% this year, making the company the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. Shares of Intel fell 1.6% in extended trading on Friday, while those of Nvidia were up 2.2%. This development comes a day after Intel expressed optimism about the future of its PC and server businesses, projecting current-quarter revenue above estimates but warning that it had "a lot of work to do." "Losing the status of Dow Jones inclusion would be another reputational blow for Intel, as it grapples with a painful transformation and loss of confidence," said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. "It would also mean that Intel is not included in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which track the index, which could impact the share price further." Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, "Intel Inside" stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Intel's revenue was $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from 2021, when Pat Gelsinger took over as CEO. Analysts expect Intel to report its first annual net loss this year since 1986. The company is worth less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. That pales in comparison to Nvidia, which is sitting at a $3.32 trillion valuation, making it the world's second-most valuable company. NVIDIA'S AI LEAD Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company's shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia's graphics processors, it is now seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company's 10-for-one stock split that took effect in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders. Intel, on the other hand, has struggled to gain share in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia, with the front-runner's chips hard to get and even harder to replace in AI datacenters, owing to the processors' technological edge and the high costs of replacing them.

Title: Amazon is still figuring out Alexa's AI brain

A decade after making waves with its voice assistant, Alexa, Amazon (AMZN+1.88%) seems to be struggling to bring it into the generative artificial intelligence era. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said the company is continuing “to rearchitect the brain” of its voice assistant with a set of next-generation foundation models — or larger models trained on broad, generalized data sets. “When we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world’s best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea,” David Fildes, Amazon vice president of investor relations, said. “And I think if you look at what’s happened in generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you’re kind of missing the boat if you don’t believe that’s going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen.” By rearchitecting Alexa with its foundation models, Fildes said Amazon believes it has “an opportunity to be the leader” in the next generation of voice assistants and generative AI applications. The next generation, he said, will not only be better at answering questions and summarizing data, “but also taking actions.” Jassy said Amazon would share the new models with customers soon, and that the company is “increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices,” including the Kindle. Amazon declined to share more specifics on its release plans in an email to Quartz. Alexa AI’s postponed release is due to technical challenges, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. One person told the publication that Amazon’s Alexa AI teams were recently told their target deadline is now in 2025. In June, Fortune reported that the AI-powered Alexa — which Amazon demoed last September and said would be available for a free preview on its Alexa-fitted devices in the U.S. — is not even close to being ready. Former employees told the publication that the company doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its voice assistant. The company also reportedly deprioritized Alexa AI to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon said its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.79%) graphics processing units (GPUs). “We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices,” an Amazon spokesperson previously told Quartz in a statement. “We are excited about what we’re building and look forward to delivering it for our customers.” On Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call, Jassy said Amazon has a “very deep partnership with Nvidia” and plans to “be their lead partner on most of their new chips.” Production of the second version of Amazon’s training chips, Trainium, will start ramping up in the next few weeks, Jassy said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped, set for a comeback on Friday as investors digested a big miss in the monthly jobs report, and welcomed Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8%, both coming off a steep selloff fueled by worries about Big Tech's AI spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added roughly 0.8%. Markets took in their stride the disappointing headline numbers in the all-important jobs report. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, significantly missing expectations. The government said those numbers were weighed down by recent hurricanes and strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA). The report is the last major economic data before the Federal Reserve's next policy decision on Nov. 7. Market expectations for that meeting moved little in its wake, with traders pricing in about 98% odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed meeting next week, per CME FedWatch.

Its shares jumped over 6% in morning trading after CEO Andy Jassy said its cloud unit's AI business was seeing triple-digit revenue growth. Morale also got a lift from Intel's (INTC) earnings beat and outlook, which revived hopes for the chipmaker's turnaround and boosted the stock. But Apple (AAPL) shares slipped as its results and outlook left Wall Street wanting more. Elsewhere in corporates, Boeing shares tipped higher after the union backed its latest offer to end a significant factory workers' strike. The sweetened deal would lift wages by 38%. Meanwhile, oil prices rose over 2% amid revived Mideast fears, after a report that Iran is planning a strike on Israel via militias that it backs in Iraq. Brent (BZ=F) crude futures traded at around $74 a barrel after briefly nudging $75, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures were not far off the $71 level. Wall Street positioned itself for a turnaround Friday after a strong showing from Amazon (AMZN) lifted investor sentiment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped 0.5% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, both coming off steep losses fueled by after-earnings tumbles in Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.4%. But impressive reports from Amazon and Intel (INTC) set stocks on a comeback trajectory. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend "more than that" in 2025, showing investors that heavy AI spending can coincide with profit growth. Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) stocks jumped Friday, lifting Nvidia (NVDA) shares with them. Amazon stock jumped as much as 7% premarket as the company proved it can balance hefty AI spending with profit growth. The company’s profit jumped more than 50% to over $17 billion in the third quarter, and its 11% operating margin came in above Wall Street’s expectations of just over 9%. At the same time, CEO Andy Jassy said the company will likely rack up $75 billion in expenses for the full year and spend even more next year. That’s good news for Nvidia, which rose 1.5% premarket. The AI chipmakers’ shares had fallen a day earlier amid fears of moderating AI spending from Big Tech firms. The stock was also helped by positive sentiment on Intel, which itself jumped 7.6% premarket after giving an upbeat fourth quarter outlook. Intel’s guidance lifted chip stocks across the board after a rough few days. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) fell roughly 2% on weaker-than-expected China sales, a hefty EU tax payment and a soft sales outlook for the current period. Apple projected sales will rise in the low-to-mid single digits in the December quarter, lower than the 7% expected by analysts. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, fewer than the 100,000 economists expected. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. Recent strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA), and weather-related disruptions weighed on the labor market last month, the government said.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is in a veritable maelstrom at the moment, battling allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, an audit-related nightmare where the firm has lost its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. Now, a Mizuho analyst is arguing that NVIDIA might not be able to emerge from this saga unscathed, especially as Super Micro Computer constitutes its third-largest customer. Mizuho on $SMCI $NVDA $DELL Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) October 31, 2024 To wit, Mizuho believes that, as an enterprise with a negative working capital paradigm that necessitates extensive external funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid-cooled products "to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems," Super Micro Computer might not be able to tap the requisite external liquidity in the coming days, owing to a growing host of risk factors. Should SMCI face a funding deficit, it will have a direct bearing on NVIDIA, which is "now at risk of missing guidance," as per Mizuho's assessment. The analyst goes on to note: "My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL." Meanwhile, as noted above, Super Micro Computer's travails are only getting more entrenched. First, Hindenburg Research leveled hard-hitting allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, asserting that the server provider engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. BREAKING: Super Micro Computer was warned if it fails to provide an audited compliance plan by Nov 16, it will be delisted from the Nasdaq. This news comes 1 day after auditor Ernst & Young resigned. $SMCI is $NVDA's 3rd largest customer & heavy user of $NVDA's vendor financing. https://t.co/SQKE9Oc3zB pic.twitter.com/cBSEFfFVQi — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 31, 2024 In the aftermath, Super Micro Computer delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, 2024, presumably in a bid to undertake a comprehensive internal review. Under the prevailing statutory requirements, that report had to be filed by the 30th of August. What's more, SMCI's continuing dilatory tactics have now attracted the wrath of the Nasdaq exchange, which has warned of a potential de-listing action should the firm fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. What's more, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. Elsewhere, as we recently reported, Ernst & Young (EY) sent a letter to Super Micro Computer's audit committee earlier this week, tendering its resignation as the company's officially designated accounting firm: “We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.” Bear in mind that, with EY's resignation, Super Micro Computer has lost its second auditor in around 18 months. $SMCI said it "disagreed" with the accounting firm's decision and does not expect the "resolution of any matters raised by EY" to result in the restatement of its quarterly reports for fiscal 2024 or prior fiscal years. — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) October 30, 2024 Interestingly, throughout this saga, SMCI has continued to profess innocence and has maintained that its annual report for the fiscal year 2024 will not undergo "any material changes." Over the past five trading days, Super Micro Computer shares have recorded a whopping loss of 37 percent.
