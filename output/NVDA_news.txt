Title: Ethereum price under pressure as $6B options expiry nears

ETH options data shows investors increasing downside protection as the year-end $6 billion options expry approaches, signaling caution. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) has been unable to sustain prices above $3,400 for the past 40 days, raising concerns among traders that bears may remain in control longer. Key takeaways: $6B in Ether options will expire on Friday, with call (buy) bets outnumbering put (sell) instruments by 2.2 times. Bears hold the advantage unless ETH price breaks $3,100. The $6 billion ETH options expiry on Friday may add further pressure, as bulls had anticipated year-end prices of $4,000 or higher before the 28% crash in November. Ether’s price at 8:00 am UTC on Friday will determine whether bears retain control, despite call options outnumbering put instruments by a factor of 2.2. Deribit accounts for 70% of total open interest, followed by the Chicago-based CME with 20%. However, most of the $4.1 billion in call options are set to expire worthless on Friday, as traders concentrated bullish bets on year-end Ether prices between $3,500 and $5,000. Less than 15% of aggregate call options were positioned at $3,000 or lower. Related: Trend Research quietly becomes one of Ethereum’s largest whales with 46K ETH buy Even excluding overly optimistic calls at $5,000 and above, which likely carried limited cost to buyers, data shows that fewer than 25% of these instruments were placed below $3,200. Traders often sell covered calls at $8,000 and $10,000 year-end strikes with no realistic expectation of reaching those levels. While bulls were overly confident that Ether would reclaim $3,400 by year-end, bearish strategies may also have gone too far by clustering bets between $2,200 and $2,900. If Ether trades above $2,950 on Friday, more than 60% of the $1.9 billion in aggregate put options will expire worthless. Even so, bearish positions remain better placed as long as ETH stays below $3,200. Investors reacted to Thursday’s reports that Intel failed in its push to manufacture advanced chips in the US as it sought to challenge global leader Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC US). According to Bloomberg, Nvidia (NVDA US) halted production tests that relied on Intel’s manufacturing processes. As traders priced in weaker prospects for the economic impact of artificial intelligence in the US, many moved to hedge their ETH positions. Demand for bearish ETH options strategies increased, including the “bear diagonal put spread,” “bear put spread” and “bear call spread,” particularly after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $3,400 level over the past five weeks. Below are four probable scenarios for the year-end ETH aggregate options expiry based on current price trends: $2,700 to $2,900: The net result favors the put instruments by $580 million. $2,901 to $3,000: The net result favors the put instruments by $440 million. $3,101 to $3,200: Balanced outcome between call and put options. $3,201 to $3,300: The net result favors the call instruments by $150 million. A Friday expiry below $2,900 could further weaken Ether investor sentiment. However, Ether bulls still have an opportunity to push prices toward $3,100 on Friday, which would help balance positioning and distance Ether’s price from the $2,775 December lows.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025. Impressively, Advanced Micro Devices’ net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales. Turning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices’ net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company’s cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that’s on a powerful growth trajectory. While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices’ business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China’s chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ MI308 AI accelerators. This is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there. Advanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China. Also, it’s a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They “exchanged views on the company’s business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,” according to the ‍ministry. Sure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China’s chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company’s progress in this region. In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices’ growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China. In the final analysis, there’s no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk. While Advanced Micro Devices doesn’t pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there’s an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.

Title: Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world’s second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street. There are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI “replacing” the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals. Let’s take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026. Google was supposed to “die” after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can. Then, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI “Bard” rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in “code red” mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards. If you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI’s sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each. If you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI’s GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models. Alphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn’t spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have gone into net debt. If Google’s rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated. As for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with. In contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it. Software isn’t Alphabet’s only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia’s near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient. Meta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth “billions of dollars,” with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia’s coffers instead. The threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google’s AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating. I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world’s largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030. Nvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: AI trade isn’t dead: An inside look into Wall Street's lucrative data center deals

As fears mount that the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble has popped, Wall Street dealmaking is being kept alive by a fundamental problem: bitcoin BTC$87,237.40 miners and data center developers still require serious amounts of power. “M&A work is still ongoing as people still need power,” said Joe Nardini, head of investment banking at B. Riley Securities, in an interview with CoinDesk. Nardini said demand for power from bitcoin miners remains “huge,” but added that the pull from AI and high-performance computing (HPC) is “even bigger,” with data center and mining clients reporting sustained demand for GPU-ready facilities. After the bitcoin halving cut rewards in half, miners faced a severe margin squeeze even with prices near or above $100,000 and increasingly pivoted to hosting AI and high-performance computing (HPC) hardware in their existing data centers. This helped drive sharp gains in some BTC mining stocks this year as AI hype swept through the market. Read more: GPU Gold Rush: Why Bitcoin Miners Are Powering AI’s Expansion Earlier in 2025, rising concerns about artificial intelligence and lofty valuations erased significant market value from major tech names, including Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI beneficiaries, as investors took profits and reassessed whether prices had outpaced fundamentals. AI infrastructure specialist CoreWeave’s (CRWV) stock also retreated and is now more than 50% below its June peak. Does this mean the AI trend is over? Nardini doesn't think so, and he has some simple logic behind this that he asks executives: Do clients have demand for the data center capacity they’ve built? “Yes.” Do they have tenants? “Yes.” Are they good tenants? “Yes.” Are they getting good rates? “Yes.” Across multiple conversations, he said the message has been consistent: “So the demand is still there.” In fact, Hut 8 shares rallied as much as 20% last week after signing a 15-year, $7 billion lease with Fluidstack for 245 megawatts of IT capacity at its River Bend campus. “Despite the recent selloff, these companies have been well rewarded with higher valuation multiples and the ability to raise capital at attractive valuations and terms," he said. This demand is still underpinning valuations and, increasingly, M&A negotiations, according to Nardini. In competitive situations with high-quality power and viable locations, he said, dollars per megawatt (a financial metric for value for each megawatt of electricity) can look “very attractive.” He stated that one process involved a valuation of over $400,000 per megawatt, with the potential to reach $450,000 per megawatt, depending on the outcome of negotiations. In fact, he has seen prior deals priced as high as $500,000 to $550,000 per megawatt. However, demand for distressed or less desirable locations hasn't gone away and still draws “lowball” bids, sometimes $100,000–$250,000 per megawatt, from buyers who like the power but discount the market or site quality. So who are these buyers and sellers? According to Nardini, buyers include hyperscalers (large tech companies that provide cloud computing infrastructures), AI firms, and bitcoin miners, while the seller universe is expanding beyond crypto-native players. He has seen dealmaking processes involving old industrial facilities, such as a 160-year-old facility, where the primary attraction is power, even if the market isn’t great. In another case, he said a private seller of a similar type asset drew interest from roughly 25 prospective buyers seeking NDAs, including bitcoin BTC$87,237.40 miners, hyperscalers and AI firms. That dynamic is creating an unusual strategic fork for asset owners. Sell to a hyperscaler or developer, or try to become a developer themselves. Nardini said he’s seeing industrial companies with older, idle, or near-idle facilities that have power consider selling into the AI/HPC and Bitcoin ecosystem. He cited another example involving a private client repurposing older office blocks into modular power capacity, “building 30 megawatt units at a clip," and now looking for additional funding to expand. In at least one negotiation, he said, a tenant was even prepared to prepay rent before completion, an illustration, in his view, of how scarce desirable capacity remains. Looking into 2026, Nardini said the setup still favors risk assets if rates fall, calling it a potentially “risk-on environment,” which will be positive for dealmaking in his industry. He acknowledged he may be “talking his book a little,” but said the operating reality he’s hearing from executives keeps him constructive: the tenants are there, pricing remains strong, and if one customer doesn’t take a site, “someone else will.” His caveat to the positive sentiment is simple: if developers can’t lease what they build, or can’t get the price they need, that would be the moment to worry. For now, he says he isn’t hearing that. “The bones of the business remain intact,” he said. He concluded with a blunt assessment of the sentiment. "The demand for power and AI HPC data center capacity continues unabated. Developers with data center capacity have demand from multiple creditworthy tenants at good rates, so the core economics of business remain intact." Nardini said buyers are still hungry for energy, and sellers are seeing good valuations for their assets. This solidifies his conviction further. “The AI trade is still alive as of Dec. 17, 2025,” he said.

Title: If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall Street The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn’t a traditional dividend ETF – AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD’s price movements. AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund’s 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums. The fund’s income depends entirely on AMD’s volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD’s 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY’s triple-digit distribution rate. AMDY’s strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD’s appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield. More concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY’s distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY’s net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation. AMD’s business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY’s strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue. However, AMD’s valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY’s distributions come entirely from options premiums. AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week’s distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD’s price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund’s 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline. Investors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels. Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Investing Nvidia is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lupmotion / Shutterstock.com After gaining $6.85 on Friday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up another $3.25 in premarket. The tech giant is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating, thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. “We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Technically, after finding triple bottom support dating back to September, NVDA is now challenging resistance at its 50-day moving average. However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next. Plus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research. After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher. From its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation. On her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post. After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket. While Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI. As we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.
