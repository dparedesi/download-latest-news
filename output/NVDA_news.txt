Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Amid rising infrastructure demands, AI startups like Crusoe Energy Systems are tapping large-scale credit lines, PitchBook reported. Crusoe last month raised a $750 million credit facility from Brookfield Asset Management BAM to expand its data centers and acquire more graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. NVDA. That deal reflects a broader trend in venture financing. AI and machine learning startups have secured an outsized share of venture debt so far, accounting for more than a third of the $30 billion deployed across the U.S. and Europe, according to PitchBook. That marks a significant increase from 2024, when such companies attracted 24.9%, or $22.9 billion, of total debt funding. Don't Miss: According to PitchBook, the shift toward debt financing is being driven by rising compute costs and high early-stage valuations in AI. "There are companies coming out of the gate with these large chunky seed rounds," Silicon Valley Bank Managing Director, Early-Stage Startups Bo Ren told PitchBook. "But then there's a Series A valuation drop-off because they can't live up to the VC expectations." Ren said that many AI startups are turning to venture debt earlier in their lifecycle as they struggle to maintain growth targets set by their inflated early valuations. Ren also cited infrastructure costs as a key factor: "Given the cost of compute, it's very much like the price of gas, it just keeps going up and up. That's where a lot of the venture debt conversations start," she told Pitchbook. PitchBook data shows that the median pre-money valuation for AI startups has climbed to $25 million so far this year, up from $15 million in 2024. Trending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share Several AI infrastructure startups have recently raised major venture debt deals to purchase high-performance chips. Lambda Labs also raised a $500 million special-purpose financing vehicle, collateralized by GPUs it already owned, to expand its chip inventory. GPU cloud provider CoreWeave CRWE, which recently went public, raised $2.3 billion in debt with similar terms, PitchBook reported. The loan was backed by the company's Nvidia GPU stockpile. See Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25 "How long is the useful life of those chips? If it's 10 years or even seven years, that makes sense," CIBC Innovation Banking Executive Managing Director and Co-Head Paul McKinlay told PitchBook. "But if it's two years, that starts to become a tougher proposition." PitchBook reported that total venture debt deployment reached $53.3 billion in 2024, a 94.5% increase from 2023. That growth was primarily fueled by later-stage startups preserving valuations amid slowing VC rounds. In 2025, AI is driving the next wave of venture debt demand—now extending to earlier-stage companies.

Title: Tiger Global Billionaire Abruptly Dumps Nvidia, Pours $334,000,000 Into Surging US Asset

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Pluribus Unum Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds. In practice, it is GIGO. Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. 8 posted on 07/18/2025 11:16:13 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy.

Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. 19 posted on 07/18/2025 11:38:15 AM PDT by roadcat ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: TexasGator What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

TOPICS: KEYWORDS: ai; bubble; stockmarket; webistics Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-45 next last A big part of the dot-com bubble were the startup companies that went to ridiculous levels and ended up going bankrupt. Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, is predicting that two big-named tech stocks will hit astronomical market caps. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share. Meanwhile, Snowflake (SNOW) is trading for $211 per share at time of writing, and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is trading for $282 per share.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/11: In this photo illustration, the Rigetti Computing logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

July 17, 2025 09:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., July 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - On the heels of the latest Drone Production Governmental initiatives and Executive Orders, manufacturing efforts have rapidly increased. For example, in the commercial drone space, the Indoor Inspection and Surveillance Drone Market is growing globally.
