Title: These Two Charts Sum Up the AI Stock Rally in 2026

Artificial intelligence is once again fueling a scorching tech stock rally, but the rising tide is notably not lifting all boats. Shares of companies making memory and data storage devices soared in the first weeks of 2026, fueled by a shortage of the hardware essential to training and running AI models. Sandisk (SNDK) stock has doubled in value in less than a month, while Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) have each gained more than 30%. They’ve been joined by semi caps, the firms whose products enable the design and fabrication of the chips powering the AI revolution. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) stock was up more than 25% as of Thursday's close, followed closely behind by Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC), each up nearly 20%. The AI rally has been the driving force behind the stock market for more than three years. But the AI trade has repeatedly shape-shifted, with investors bidding up certain sub-sectors and industries as new bottlenecks in the AI infrastructure buildout emerge. Then there’s Intel (INTC), one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Wall Street is betting that investments by the federal government and AI king-maker Nvidia (NVDA) will help the storied chipmaker turn things around after years of trouble. The stock plummeted on Friday after the company issued a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, reminding investors that the turnaround they seek will be “a multiyear journey,” in the words of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. On the flip side are software stocks, beaten down by concerns that artificial intelligence is more threat than opportunity at the moment. Software giants like Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE) and Salesforce (CRM) are among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Investors are worried AI-native start-ups are poised to take share from enterprise software incumbents whose deployment of AI agents has moved slower than expected. AI is also seen as a threat to the seat-based pricing model that helps make software-as-a-service companies stable and profitable. Investors are also down on software stocks because most of the industry isn't profiting from AI nearly as much as "pick-and-shovel-makers" like Nvidia—at least not yet. Software executives can attribute small profit margin gains to AI-driven efficiency, but investors are more excited to hear Micron say its high-bandwidth memory chips are sold out through this year because of AI demand. Digital marketing software company Applovin (APP) is one of the few exceptions. The stock soared more than 700% in 2024 and doubled in value last year, because of strong revenue and earnings growth that executives attribute to its AI-powered platforms. (Several short-sellers attribute the meteoric growth to shady practices.) Applovin stock's previous gains are a big reason it's the S&P 500’s worst performer this year. Investors have taken some very profitable chips off the table amid a slump driven by software pessimism and, earlier this week, more allegations Applovin's platforms facilitate illegal activity. The stock was down 22% heading into Friday’s session.

Title: Apple turning to Intel for future iPhone chips, analyst reaffirms

Time Published: 2026-01-23T16:36:10Z

Multiple reports have indicated that Apple is turning to Intel for future iPhone chips. Now, analyst Jeff Pu is out today with a new research note once again affirming an upcoming partnership between the two companies. In December, Pu reported that Intel will start producing chips for Apple’s non-Pro iPhone models starting in 2028. In a research note seen by 9to5Mac today, Pu says that Intel has a “solid external customers pipeline” for 14A, which is the company’s 1.4nm-class process technology. Among the companies in that pipeline are Apple, AMD, and Nvidia. “We reiterate our expectation of potential order-wins such as Apple’s SP SoC and NVDA/AMD’s x86 server chips,” Pu says. Ming-Chi Kuo has also reported that Intel will “begin shipping Apple’s lowest-end M processor as early as 2027.” This would presumably be the base model M7 chip, which could be used in select iPad and Mac models. Under this arrangement, Apple will still develop and design its own iPhone and Mac processors in-house. The difference is that, instead of exclusively using TSMC to manufacture those chips, Intel would come aboard as an additional partner. This is not a return to Intel chips powering the Mac (or the iPhone). What do you think about Apple and Intel reuniting for iPhone and Mac chips? Let us know down in the comments.

Title: February 25th Will Be a Make or Break Day for NVDL

Investing NVDL has attracted $4.7B in assets by offering 2x daily leverage on Nvidia (NVDA). Daily compounding erodes returns during volatility. Nvidia posted 62.5% year-over-year revenue growth. Growth below 40% quarterly would trigger a repricing lower. Nvidia’s data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue. Next earnings report lands February 25. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / JRdes NVDL offers a straightforward but unforgiving proposition: double Nvidia’s daily return, every day. Since launching in December 2022, it has attracted $4.7 billion in assets by amplifying the defining AI infrastructure stock. Shares sit around $79, down nearly 10% year to date after NVDA slipped 4.5% through mid-January. That divergence matters. NVDL didn’t deliver exactly double NVDA’s decline because daily leverage compounds, a mechanical reality that erodes returns when the underlying stock swings sideways or trends down. For anyone holding or considering NVDL, the most important factor to watch is Nvidia’s ability to sustain revenue growth above 50% annually. That threshold matters because NVDA’s valuation premium, a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 24, depends on maintaining hypergrowth in data center demand. The company posted 62.5% revenue growth year over year in its most recent quarter ending October 2025, reaching $57 billion in sales. That pace is decelerating from the triple-digit growth rates seen throughout fiscal 2025. If quarterly revenue growth drops below 40%, expect the stock to reprice lower, and NVDL to magnify that move violently. Track Nvidia’s quarterly earnings releases, which occur roughly every three months. The next report lands February 25, 2026, after market close. Pay attention to three figures: data center revenue growth, gross margin trajectory, and management’s guidance for the following quarter. Data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue, and any sign of slowing hyperscaler spending from Microsoft, Amazon, or Google will hit the stock hard. Gross margin, currently above 75%, reflects Nvidia’s pricing power. If that figure compresses due to competitive pressure from custom AI chips, it signals eroding dominance. NVDL resets its leverage every day, which means it doesn’t deliver double NVDA’s return over longer periods. In volatile or sideways markets, daily compounding works against you. NVDA’s RSI currently sits at 40.4, down from 51.8 just four days earlier, signaling weakening momentum without reaching oversold territory below 30. If NVDA continues chopping sideways while investors wait for the next earnings catalyst, NVDL will underperform a simple 2x calculation due to volatility decay. This isn’t a flaw, it’s how daily leveraged products work. Direxion’s SOXL offers 3x daily leverage on the broader semiconductor sector through the ICE Semiconductor Index, which includes NVDA but also TSMC, Broadcom, and AMD. While more aggressive, it spreads single-stock risk across the chip industry. If you’re concerned about Nvidia-specific execution risk, like supply constraints or competitive threats from custom silicon, SOXL provides sector exposure without total dependence on one company’s quarterly performance. Watch Nvidia’s data center revenue growth and NVDL’s daily compounding behavior. Those two factors will determine whether this ETF continues amplifying gains or eroding capital through volatility.

Title: Nvidia Vs. Dogecoin: A Historic Ratio Suggests A Possible Rotation, Says Trader

Trader Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) is arguing that an old relative-value signal is “back” in crypto markets, pointing to the DOGE/NVIDIA ratio and an unusually depressed Dogecoin RSI reading as evidence that capital could rotate from AI-linked equities into high-beta meme coins. In a post on X, Cryptollica said the DOGE/NVIDIA chart has returned to a long-term support zone that previously preceded outsized Dogecoin outperformance versus Nvidia in prior cycles. “THE SIGNAL IS BACK. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN (2017… 2021… NOW),” the trader wrote. “The last two times this specific signal flashed on the DOGE/NVIDIA chart, we saw the biggest wealth transfer in history. The crowd is chasing the AI top. The algorithm is loading the Meme bottom. (Altcoin bottom).” The core claim is less about Dogecoin in isolation and more about positioning on a ratio between what Cryptollica framed as two cultural extremes: “You are watching the wrong chart. This is the ratio of ‘The World’s Most Valuable Company’ (AI) vs. ‘The World’s Most Famous Meme’.” From that framing, the trader leans into a cycle-rhymes narrative, asserting that the ratio has repeatedly found channel support before a DOGE-led surge. “Structure is repeating history,” Cryptollica wrote, attaching specific historical comparisons. “2017: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 100x. 2021: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 50x. NOW: We are back at the exact same support line.” The posts also attach a broader liquidity-rotation story that has circulated in various forms across risk markets: when one trade stops working, capital seeks the next high-beta outlet: “When the AI Bubble exhales, that liquidity doesn’t vanish. It rotates into High-Beta Speculation,” the trader wrote. “The crowd is buying NVDA at the top. The algorithm is positioning for the DOGE reversal.” In another post, Cryptollica shifted from the ratio to Dogecoin’s weekly momentum indicator, sharing a second chart highlighting RSI levels and labeling prior cycle lows. “Here you are witnessing an opportunity that only comes around once every 12 years,” the trader wrote. “Over the past 12 years (2014–2026), Dogecoin’s RSI has dropped this low only 4 times. Every single one was an epic buying opportunity.” The post describes those four moments as a sequence of cycle bottoms, including an “all-time low” first cycle bottom, a “cycle bottom + COVID crash,” a “last cycle bottom,” and “RIGHT NOW!” Cryptollica concluded with a blunt decision frame: “Math or emotions — which one decides for you?” While neither post includes an explicit price target, the analyst said in early December that he expects Dogecoin to reach $1.30 over the medium term, citing a parallel channel top on the 3-day DOGE/USD chart. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12581. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.
