Title: Nvidia's stock is down over 10% as Trump talks up tariffs

While Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.15%) shares have tripled in value so far this year, its shares dropped more than 10% in the week after it reported fiscal third-quarter earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down by about 2.3% during Wednesday afternoon trading and was down by almost 10.4% over the past five days. After the company reported record fiscal third-quarter earnings last week, Nvidia’s shares fell by almost 3.5% in after-hours trading. The decline continued the following morning, with the stock dropping around 1%. Despite beating revenue estimates for another straight quarter, Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — only slightly above what analysts were expecting. The stock slide deepened Monday, when Nvidia’s shares dropped by more than 4% after Reuters (TRI+0.57%) reported that the company’s executive vice president of Worldwide Field Operations Jay Puri had met with Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen in Beijing. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on Chinese imports by 60% or more when he takes office in January, recently adding that he would impose an additional 10% tariff “on all of their many products coming into the United States of America” until China stops the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US. These proposed tariffs could spark retaliatory measures from Beijing, with Chinese state media warning Tuesday that “there are no winners in tariff wars.” China remains a crucial market for Nvidia, accounting for about 17% of the company’s revenue in the year ending January 2024, down from 26% two years earlier due to existing US export restrictions. The company’s latest China-specific chip, the H20, is projected to generate over $12 billion in sales this year, according to research group SemiAnalysis. Meanwhile, the outgoing Biden administration is expected to announce new export controls on China as early as next week, Reuters reported, that could target hundreds of Chinese chip companies. The U.S. has already imposed several trade restrictions to prevent U.S. firms, including Nvidia, from exporting U.S.-made technology to China.

Title: Elon Musk's demands for Nvidia's AI chips strained its supply

Tesla (TSLA-1.58%) CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of artificial intelligence chips for his supercomputer has pushed Nvidia (NVDA-1.15%) to its production limits. In an email to colleagues, a sales lead at the chipmaker said the billionaire’s demand for its chips was straining its supply chain, the Wall Street Journal (NWS-0.91%) reported, citing the email it viewed. “We’ve worked hard to meet the needs of all customers and have greatly expanded the available supply today,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. In September, Musk announced that his AI startup, xAI, had brought its Colossus training cluster online after only 122 days. Colossus, which he called “the most powerful AI training system in the world,” is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 training chips. Musk said the cluster “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 units. While AI rivals including OpenAI and Meta (META-0.76%) also have hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s chips, Colossus has the most processors of an individual AI computing cluster in the world. During an Oracle (ORCL-4.03%) investor event in September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he and Musk spent a dinner “begging” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang for more of Nvidia’s AI chips. “Please take our money. No, no take more of it. We need you to take more of our money. Please,” Ellison said about the conversation. “It went okay. It worked.” xAI’s supercomputer will be used to train the next generation of xAI’s large language model (LLM), Grok, which is meant to rival OpenAI’s GPT-4. In May, the AI startup raised $6 billion from heavyweight investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. The Series B funding round pushed xAI to a $24 billion valuation. Earlier this month, it was reported that xAI is set to raise another $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq slide after key Fed inflation gauge shows faltering progress

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks dipped Wednesday as investors digested fresh data that showed inflation made little progress toward the Fed's 2% target in October. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off about 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down roughly 0.6%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by the debate over the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans and Cabinet choices. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the top US trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down more than 11%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While a holiday-shortened market day on Friday still separates investors from a fresh month of trading, December is nearly here. And Carson group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 of 10 times. In more recent history, since 2000, the index has risen in every December after the strong rally to start the year. The rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency returned on Wednesday afternoon. After surging near $100,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC-USD) had been quieter this week. But late Wednesday, bitcoin quickly moved higher from a low of $91,804 to a high of $97,357. While traditional markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, bitcoin's $100,000 watch will roll on. Mortgage rates edged lower as financial markets reacted to President-elect Donald Trump’s slate of Cabinet picks. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: President-elect Donald Trump has been quick to promise new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. Read more here. Recent inflation prints have shown little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, showed prices rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with the reading from the September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% seen the year prior. And as our chart below shows, the short-term trend hasn't painted a better picture either. Over the past three months, core PCE has risen at annualized rate of 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% goal. While key inflation readings from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for November loom before the Fed meets again in mid-December, the current inflation data has some economists questioning if the central bank will pause interest rate cuts soon. "Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months," Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. "If you think the Fed is on a declining rate path, which we do, that's probably leaning toward the pause [cutting interest rates] camp." Gruenwald added that the Fed won't be in a hurry to cut rates unless it sees a "more convincing decline" in core PCE. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 3% on Wednesday, weighing on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Shares in the AI chip giant are off about 9% in the past five days as investors have digested the company's latest quarterly earnings release. Other tech stocks were lower on Wednesday, including Dell (DELL). The company's stock fell more than 10% following its quarterly earnings release. In a call with analysts, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said AI spending "will not be linear." Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. "We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment," Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. "In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there." Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. "A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market," Bank of America's Bhave said. "For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims." "So while the labor market has moderated," Bhave said, "It hasn’t rolled over!" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth "will not be linear." "AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down," Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. "That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing." Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Read more about Dell's most recent earnings results and its role in the AI market here. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. Read more here. Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued "US exceptionalism," continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the "global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity." He added, "heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment." US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%. Economic data: Personal income & spending (October); MBA mortgage applications (Nov. 22); GDP annualized (third quarter second estimate); Wholesale inventories (October); Initial jobless claims, (week ending Nov. 23); Pending home sales Earnings: No notable earnings releases.

Enrique Lores "Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China.

Title: Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report. The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade — and the likes of Nvidia

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/26/2024 4:05:54 AM PST by RoosterRedux President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

I believe that if Trump takes office again, he will likely encourage TSMC to expedite the construction of additional facilities, although this is complicated by the current shortage of a highly trained labor force in the U.S. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry. 9 posted on 11/26/2024 4:36:27 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson (paraphrased): "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

I believe that if Trump takes office again, he will likely encourage TSMC to expedite the construction of additional facilities, although this is complicated by the current shortage of a highly trained labor force in the U.S. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry. 9 posted on 11/26/2024 4:36:27 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson (paraphrased): "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ... I think this is the primary reason. Because we all know Democrats and their UniParty RINO accomplices are all about reducing costs for and taxes on American citizens. As far as I know all the AI Nvidia chips are made at TSMC fab in Taiwan. The only place that has the extreme expertise to make them. This fab is rigged to blow up all important stations if the CCP invades Taiwan. FUDH Does this also mean the US can stop spending billions of tax payer dollars to 'defend democracy' in Taiwan? Sounds like a win-win to me. Sounds like a win-win to me. “end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD)” Housing, feeding and provide health care for invaders and their offspring costs money. Providing defense for Taiwan costs money. If the US military wasn’t funded, the PRC flag would be flying over where the silicon foundries are. Hitting the Russian bear in Ukraine to deter the PRC from invading Taiwan is expensive. Many of the chips never make it to the USA, they go to the EU, Japan, elsewhere in Taiwan, Canada, etc. Joe Biden launched a program to build chips in the USA years ago and spent billions of US taxpayer money. We wouldn’t want to undermine his legacy. Having chip companies repay in tariffs the money Joe spent to build chip plants seems fair. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry.

I think Trump’s plan is to selectively apply tariffs to encourage US production.

Title: 5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/26/investing-stocks-gold-ai-etf/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years. The share price of Constellation, America’s largest owner of nuclear plants, has more than doubled this year. Wall Street expects the company to post yearly earnings growth of 30% for 2024, while Visible Alpha predicts free cash flows could reach $1.5 billion. Building new plants is a regulatory nightmare, notes CFRA Research’s Daniel Reuven Rich, which gives existing operators an advantage. “They’re the only game in town,” he says, and it’s become a lucrative one. A thousand miles south, and 250 miles off the coast of New Orleans, the oil and gas company TechnipFMC (FTI) is building an elaborate network of manifolds and umbilical cords for between $250 million and $500 million to help oil giant BP extract 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Last quarter alone, the U.K.-incorporated company doing business from Houston secured $2.5 billion in subsea orders, adding to a backlog of $14.7 billion. Shareholders received $394 million in dividends and share buybacks in the first nine months of 2024 alone. But ATB Capital Markets analyst Waqar Syed says that’s only the beginning. Even as the company is projected to pull in around $9 billion in annual revenue, Syed says the backlog means not all the cash has been counted. “Orders are coming in at a much higher rate than the revenues are,” he says. “At some point their revenue is going to catch up.” Syed predicts FTI’s future cash flows will increase 76% in 2025 to $859.2 million, and the company has committed to return at least 60% of its future cash flow to shareholders. Looking abroad, it may be a good time to consider Spanish energy giant Iberdrola (IBDRY). Through its public U.S. subsidiary, Avangrid, it has doubled down on its renewable investments in the U.S., particularly with offshore wind. The company has pumped a combined $13.28 billion into projects in America and the U.K. over the past year, helping drive a 50% boost in net income through the first nine months of 2024. —Michael del Castillo and Greg Mckenna Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the explosive demand for artificial intelligence has driven a broader stock market boom. Public companies directly tied to the field have seen their market caps skyrocket, while industries even tangentially related to AI—such as the once-unloved utility sector—have enjoyed a bump. Given all the hype, skeptical investors may fear the sector has crossed the line from boom to bubble, but many analysts say AI stocks still have room to run. Starting with pure plays, it’s hard to bet against the company at the heart of the AI boom: Nvidia (NVDA). There is a ravenous appetite for its flagship GPU chips from a wide variety of companies scrambling to keep pace in the AI era. One analyst closely following the company, CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, said that Nvidia’s total addressable market is only set to expand. Its sales totaled $30 billion last quarter, up 122% from a year ago, and Zino expects the figure to surge upwards of $50 billion in two years’ time. He expects quarterly free cash flow to soon exceed that of every firm but Apple. It also stands to reason that Nvidia’s most deep-pocketed customers are the best positioned to make the necessary capital expenditures. “The big are only going to get bigger,” says Baird’s Ted Mortonson. “The monopolies are going to get more monopolistic.” Even among the giants of Big Tech, Microsoft (MSFT) is the leading high roller, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting the company’s capital outlay could hit $53 billion this year. That capex is already generating sales, according to CEO Satya Nadella, who says Microsoft’s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion alone in OpenAI since 2019—the main reason Mortonson believes the Seattle-based cloud titan is the best pick among the traditional tech outfits. Shares recently had their worst day in two years after the company forecast cloud growth to slow next quarter, presenting a potential opportunity to “buy the dip.” That may also be the case in application software, a sector yet to realize the benefits of AI. Salesforce (CRM) has been far from a Wall Street darling recently, with the stock trailing the S&P 500 and posting revenue growth in the single digits. Zino, however, believes the company is well positioned to deliver on so-called agentic AI—think autonomous digital assistants that put generative AI into action. “We think by the end of 2025 there are going to be a lot of investors that really kind of warm up to the Salesforce story,” Zino said. Not everyone agrees. Mortonson, for example, prefers cloud computing platform ServiceNow, which benefits from a close partnership with Nvidia. For those who believe in Salesforce’s long-term AI prospects, however, buying now could prove a bargain. —Leo Schwartz and G.M. According to a report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, the number of people getting active has increased every year for a decade. The report adds that threefourths of the U.S. population, or 242 million people, participated in at least one sports or fitness activity in 2023, a 2.2% bump from 2022. For investors looking to capitalize on this trend, the sporting-goods sector is a solid bet. According to David Swartz, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, the field includes names like Adidas, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Puma. But he says one company stands out above the others. “Nike (NKE) has a closer relationship with global and American sports than any other company,” Swartz tells Fortune. Nike’s stock has been pummeled this year over strategic missteps, including a failure to develop new products and a disastrous decision to favor direct-to-consumer distribution. But Morningstar believes it is now undervalued compared with its long-term fair value estimate of $117 per share. Morningstar forecasts compound average sales growth of 5% over the next 10 years, and expects Nike will achieve compound annual revenue growth of 2% in North America. Nike’s stock hit an all-time high of $177.51 in November 2021, but has since dropped by almost 50%. Swartz believes the company is poised for a comeback now that longtime Nike exec Elliott Hill is at the helm—he returned in October—and that Nike “will benefit from the growth of sports, both in the U.S. and globally.” Alongside the trend in increased physical activity is a new focus on self-care. This includes technology that identifies health risks for women, including breast cancer detection. A leading player in the field is Hologic (HOLX), a health care company with around $4 billion in annual revenue that provides 3D mammography technology. It has an 80%-plus share of the U.S. mammography imaging market and 30% internationally, according to Andrew Brackmann, a William Blair equity research analyst. Hologic, which has about 7,000 employees, also offers a range of tests for sexually transmitted infections as well as COVID-19. Since 2021, Hologic has scooped up seven companies and grown earnings at a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, Brackmann tells Fortune. Hologic’s stock is up about 16% this year. The growing field of prenatal diagnosis also offers an opportunity for investors, especially as preterm births in the U.S. have jumped by more than 10% in the past decade. In this field, Brackmann recommends a small firm called Sera Prognostics (SERA), which has created a blood test, called PreTRM, that helps identify which women may deliver prematurely. “There is a massive market need,” he says. Sera, which employs around 63 people, went public in 2021 but has never traded at or near its $16 IPO price. In August, Sera said it plans to publish the results of its PRIME study for the PreTRM test in the spring of 2025. Sera hasn’t gotten much traction with doctors, who have asked for more data, Brackmann says. “When the publication comes out it will generate a lot of buzz,” he notes. He expects Sera, which currently has negligible revenue, to bring in more than $100 million over the next three to five years. —Sheryl Estrada and Luisa Beltran At a time when the country was reeling from soaring prices, Fortune set about to pick 13 “inflation-proof” stocks. How did we do? In the 12 months since we published in November 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a 34% total return. Our portfolio: 51%. That’s not to say all our picks were winners. Two were blockbusters: chip darling Nvidia (total return, 193%) and big data company Palantir (179%). Other outperformers included e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and hefty dividend payers Kinder Morgan (pipelines) and Boston Properties (real estate). The other eight trailed the S&P, though none delivered negative returns. (Procter & Gamble, the worst performer, still gained 6%.) But overall, the home runs far outweighed the strikeouts. —Matt Heimer This article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 edition of Fortune with the headline “5 trends for 2025 and how to invest in them.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Nvidia nearly doubles AMD's R&D budget – Intel's spending dwarfs both, but struggles to compete
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/105716-nvidia-nearly-doubles-amd-rd-budget-ndash-intel.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T05:19:17Z

The big picture: The competitive strength of hardware makers is often gauged by their research and development expenditure. However, an analysis of recent financial reports from various tech giants reveals that higher R&D spending does not always guarantee success. Intel's recent struggles and Nvidia's astronomical growth driven by the AI boom have broken conventional assumptions. Recent insights from Tech Fund reveal a widening disparity in R&D budgets between competing hardware makers AMD and Nvidia, a key factor in Nvidia's increasing market dominance. In that same mix we could look at Intel, which currently appears much weaker than both despite dwarfing their R&D spending. According to Tech Fund's analysis of Nvidia's and AMD's R&D expenditures over the past decade, Nvidia now spends twice as much as AMD. In 2013, their R&D budgets were roughly equal, but Nvidia's has since surged to approximately $12 billion, while AMD's has grown to ~$6 billion. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU This disparity is further accentuated by the allocation of spending. Nvidia focuses nearly all its R&D efforts on AI, while AMD's smaller budget is spread across GPUs, CPUs, AI, and FPGA chips. Although AMD has made impressive gains in the CPU market – recent generations of its CPUs have soundly defeated Intel – it continues to struggle against Nvidia in the GPU sector. Intel currently faces seemingly endless trouble in CPUs, GPUs, and other areas despite outspending Nvidia's and AMD's R&D by a wide margin. Source: Tom's Hardware (click to enlarge) According to Tom's Hardware, Intel allocated $16 billion to R&D in 2023 – double the combined budgets of Nvidia and AMD. For 2024, the company projects R&D, market growth, and acquisition costs will range between $17 billion and $20 billion. These funds are spread across diverse ventures, including CPUs, GPUs, quantum computing, and foundries, with significant hopes pinned on its forthcoming 18A process node. Source: App Economy Insights Despite this hefty investment, Intel's market capitalization hovers at around $107 billion, ranking 160th globally. In contrast, AMD ranks 45th with a valuation of $229 billion or more than twice of Chipzilla's. Nvidia, with its near-total devotion to AI, has entered the $3 trillion club and is vying with Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company. Nvidia's meteoric rise is particularly striking when compared to Apple's R&D spending. The Cupertino giant spent $27 billion on R&D in 2023 and $31 billion between September 2023 and September 2024. While some predict the eventual collapse of the AI bubble, which could bring Nvidia back down to Earth, there are no immediate signs of such a downturn.

Title: Meta could outdo Google in the AI transformation, professor says

Despite being one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research, Google (GOOGL+0.07%) isn’t poised to be a winner of the transformation, according to a business professor. “While Google may have blazed the trail in artificial intelligence, it’s Meta (META-0.76%) that’s poised to reap the rewards,” Howard Yu, LEGO Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School, said in a written piece shared with Quartz. The reason according to Yu, who also leads the Center for Future Readiness, is about business models. “Google’s core business model — built on the elegance of simple search and link-clicking — is actually being undermined by AI,” Yu said, “while Meta’s advertising ecosystem is being supercharged by it.” For example, Meta’s AI-powered advertising system has been able to adapt after Apple’s (AAPL-0.06%) introduction of its App Tracking Transparency feature, Yu said, which requires iOS apps to request user permission to track activity. Before, advertisers could track how users bought a product after seeing an ad. The tech giant’s probabilistic models “are working better than the old tracking system ever did,” Yu said. Meta is also “erasing the line between content and advertising,” Yu said, by using AI to make items in images and videos on social media feeds purchasable. The company “isn’t just creating ad inventory — it’s turning everything into potential inventory. And Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica (EL+1.07%) on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gives it an AI-advantage that doesn’t threaten its business. Meanwhile, Google is struggling to integrate AI into its products without threatening its search business, Yu said, which “thrives on simplicity, directing users to click on links that generate ad revenue.” With AI chatbots that can provide direct answers to queries, users don’t have to visit web pages where ads are placed. And Google’s other AI features, such as NotebookLM, “don’t necessarily strengthen its primary revenue stream.” Meta was the third-highest tech company on the Center for Future Readiness’s Future Readiness Indicator after Nvidia (NVDA-1.15%) and Microsoft (MSFT-1.17%), due to its “aggressive investments in AI” that show “strong momentum, impacting nearly all aspects of its operations,” the report said. Google parent Alphabet was the fourth-highest tech company on the list. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Volatility Amid Strong AI Demand and Growth Opportunities

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Talks Up Cooperation With China Ahead of Trump Trade War 2.0

Despite widespread fears that President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office will lead to tightened trade policies around A.I. chips to curb China’s tech advances, the CEO of Nvidia (NVDA), the largest manufacturer of A.I. chips, is still optimistic about the state of America’s relationship with China under the incoming administration. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday (Nov. 23) while accepting an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Huang, who lauded the region’s contributions towards technology like A.I., later told reporters that, while he doesn’t “know what’s going to happen with the new administration,” Nvidia will continue to balance policy and law compliance with innovative tech development.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s booming GPU business has made it one of the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion. However, like other chipmakers, its footprint in China has been shrinking in recent years amid growing geopolitical tensions and tightened export policies. Nvidia’s sales in China accounted for around 15 percent of its total revenue in the quarter ended September, a drop from 26 percent two years ago. In a continued effort under Trump’s first presidential term, the Biden administration in 2022 restricted Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China (including Hong Kong). Trump, who is poised to expand such measures, has also said he will enact tariffs in Taiwan, home to Nvidia’s largest supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). While supporting measured China policies, Huang lauded China’s “significant contributions to open science research helping to advance A.I. worldwide.” Over the years, Nvidia has benefitted from its presence in areas like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, according to the CEO. “From the beginning, we’ve had the benefit and the great joy and privilege of watching the amazing tech industry form in China,” he said. As Huang received his honorary doctorate from HKUST, he highlighted the fact that the school’s alumni have helped found more than 1,800 startups that are still in operation today. “I’m thrilled to see so much energy focused on advancing the science of A.I. as well as using A.I. to advance at HKUST and across all of China,” he said. Thanks to developments across the new technology, “the greatest challenges of our time—unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past—all of a sudden seem possible to tackle,” he added. Earlier this month, Huang said that Nvidia will comply with whichever policies the Trump administration decides upon. “We’ll of course support the administration,” said Huang during an earnings call, adding Nvidia will also simultaneously continue to support its customers and compete in the marketplace.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Monday as small caps rallied near new highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points amid a broad sense of optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a fresh record after gaining more than 400 points, or nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained 0.3%, weighed by shares of Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sank on Monday to $95,000 after recently jumping to record highs just a stone's throw away from $100,000. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher. Read more here. MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Monday it purchased another 55,000 worth of bitcoin last week for $5.4 billion as the world's largest cryptocurrency was trading at all-time highs. MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be.

Dell (DELL) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with analysts anticipating sales and profit gains from the year prior, but little further appreciation for the stock. Of the 10 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have a "buy" or equivalent rating, compared to two "hold" ratings. However, their consensus price target of $145 would imply less than 1% upside from Friday's closing price. Wall Street expects Dell to report third-quarter revenue of $24.68 billion, an 11% rise year-over-year, and net income of $1.02 billion or $1.42 per share, up from $1 billion or $1.36 per share a year ago. Morgan Stanley analysts told clients in a note Thursday they “don’t expect much upside” from Dell’s third-quarter earnings, but suggested the company could see more growth in 2025 from artificial intelligence (AI) servers. Dell makes servers that utilize Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, drawing a shoutout from the chipmaker in its earnings call Wednesday. For now, results could be hindered by “sub-seasonal PC market trends” and “flattish” quarter-over-quarter AI server growth, the analysts said. Morgan Stanley holds an “overweight” rating and $154 price target for Dell. Dell shares have gained nearly 90% since the start of the year, at $144.21 as of Friday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Phillip Securities downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $160, up from $155, following the Q3 report. The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder. The party may come to an abrupt end for Wall Street. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Examining Nancy Pelocy's Selling on Google and More

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary. But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments. Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023. The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit. Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices. And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s. As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions. Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru? Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024. Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer. Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list. Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price. On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece. If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption. And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July. And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price! Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025. Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies. Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too. But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

Title: After Nvidia earnings, is the AI trend still investors’ friend?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception. In 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the "Magnificent Seven." And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips. Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday. There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings. But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be. Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023. AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware. “We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report. On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware. Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne. “Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.” There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs. For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%. That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter. Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings. Check out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance The bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it’s just another investing trend.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.
