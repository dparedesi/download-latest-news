Title: Trump’s Tariffs Are Sabotaging America’s A.I. Leadership

Time Published: 2025-04-29T19:16:20Z

The U.S. is currently the world leader in artificial intelligence, but new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump could threaten that leadership. Earlier this spring, the president introduced sweeping new import tariffs from key trading partners. The goal is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and protect American jobs. However, its adverse effects are already being felt in the tech sector, which is worrying. According to analysts, one industry —artificial intelligence— might potentially take the harshest blow. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. A.I. companies have yet to determine if Trump tariffs are about to decimate them, and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending the tech industry into confusion. The key issue is whether GPUs, the graphics processing units, essential to A.I., computing and many other sectors, will be exempted from Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The A.I. industry’s infrastructure depends on a hyper-global supply chain—chips, cooling systems and servers—nearly every component coming from overseas. Now, thanks to tariffs as high as 32 percent on Taiwanese imports, building A.I. in the U.S. could become drastically more expensive. The tech markets have already flinched hard. Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC and the Magnificent Seven also faced decline following the announcement. The message from Wall Street is clear: these tariffs, even temporary, are a direct threat to the A.I. sector. Even as the stock market tumbles and companies scramble for clarity, the real question remains: Are these tariffs truly protecting American industries, or are they hurting the innovation that drives them? It doesn’t help that the administration has done almost nothing to clarify its intent. Chips imported as standalone components may be safe, but most don’t arrive that way. They come embedded in servers, which are fairly in tariffs’ crosshairs. A single A.I. GPU costs tens of thousands of dollars, and A.I. labs need thousands. Slapping a 30 percent tariff on those machines is a costly bet. AllianceBernstein analysts also voiced similar concerns. There’s open speculation inside tech companies that Trump will offer exemptions to companies he favors, just like he did for Apple in his first term. But that’s not policy. That’s patronage. The broader economic effects could be devastating. The tariffs affect A.I. infrastructure, raw materials, cooling systems, construction supplies and even rare earth materials. A.I. companies are already mulling whether it might be cheaper to build data centers abroad. A.I. data centers, powering everything from ChatGPT to Meta’s new Llama models, are hugely expensive to build. With tariffs slapped on top, the cost of building those data centers in the U.S. could rise so fast that companies might have to build them elsewhere. Some already are. So let’s get this straight: In the name of “America First,” Trump is pushing a narrative that it’s cheaper to build the future of A.I. outside the U.S. The irony here is painful. These tariffs were meant to protect American technological leadership. Instead, they push the next-generation A.I. breakthrough overseas, just as China doubles down on its domestic compute investments. While A.I. chips imported as standalone products are largely exempt, many servers and essential datacenter components will face higher tariffs that could increase the cost of building A.I. infrastructure. According to CBRE estimates, the object tariffs will boost construction costs for commercial projects—including A.I. data centers—by 3 to 5 percent as higher steel, aluminum and copper prices feed directly into building budgets. If an electronics exemption on Chinese imports is rolled back, data-center equipment currently duty-free could face a 145 percent tariff. This would more than double the cost of servers, storage arrays and ancillary hardware procured from China. So, U.S. tariffs could raise A.I. development costs by hundreds of millions. This is not a soft threat. It signals a heightened risk that could break supply chains powering A.I. innovation across the next two years. Semiconductor policy now collides directly with America’s A.I. momentum. The problem is not tariffs alone. It is a mix of capital cost spikes, talent shortages, regulatory fog and hardware bottlenecks. Without decisive action, Washington’s A.I. strategy is at risk, and Washington might fall behind its global competitors within the next 12 to 18 months. Tariffs are only one layer of policy risk. Export controls, investment restrictions and the possibility of counter-retaliation by trading partners add to the instability. Large-scale A.I. infrastructure is capital-intensive. Training a frontier A.I. model today can cost upwards of $100 million. Data centers require billions in investment to meet demand. Tariff-driven hardware inflation raises the total project cost. Microsoft (MSFT) has already shelved two gigawatts of new data centers, while Amazon (AMZN) has delayed key lease deals. Of course, there’s still a chance the administration walks this back—or at least sacrifices the rules. But even if an exemption comes through, the damage has been done. Companies are now factoring Trump’s unpredictability into their long-term decisions. The smart money will go where policy is stable and costs are clear. Artificial intelligence is too important to America’s economy and national security to be jerked around by tariff roulette. If the U.S. wants to stay ahead, it needs smart, forward-looking industrial policy—not slogans, not guesswork. And let’s not forget: China is watching. While the U.S. is busy sabotaging its own A.I. momentum, China is investing, scaling and integrating artificial intelligence into every facet of its economy. The current issue is more than just a trade dispute—it’s about the future of U.S. technology. These tariffs aren’t merely a tax on foreign goods; they are a tax on the future of the U.S. tech sector. If the U.S. wants to remain competitive, it must rethink its approach to global trade. Tariffs are not a solution; policies that support growth are.

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the S&P 500 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges. Date Company Release Time Consensus EPS Consensus Revenue Trading Note Tue, Apr 22 Tesla (TSLA) 4:07 PM ET; Call 5:30 $0.43 $21.8 B Beat? Unwind TSLA/TSLQ hedge; Miss? Add NVDS or QID positions.

Fri, Apr 26 Microsoft (MSF If the U.S. avoids a recession, the Magnificent Seven are poised for outsized profit growth in 2025. But even the strongest fundamentals can be shaken by market turbulence. By dynamically switching between Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies during VIX spikes and reverting to buy-and-hold when volatility subsides—and by tactically deploying inverse ETFs like QID to hedge downturns—you can both protect capital and ride the next leg of the Mag 7 rally.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares led losses on the Dow and S&P 500 Monday afternoon following a report China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test a rival artificial intelligence chip. According to The Wall Street Journal, Huawei "is gearing up to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, which the company hopes could replace some higher-end products" from Nvidia. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that "Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D." Shares of Nvidia, which declined to comment on the report, were down close to 4% in recent trading. They've lost a fifth of their value since the start of the year, and have yet to fully recover from their plunge on Jan. 27 that wiped nearly $600 billion from the company's market cap when Chinese startup DeepSeek said its models rivaled those of OpenAI's Chat GPT at a fraction of the cost. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it is expecting to record a $5.5 billion first-quarter charge after the U.S. limited exports of its H20 chips to China. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect Nvidia declined to comment.

Chinese tech giant Huawei is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), according to a new report. Huawei Technologies will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips from manufacturers as soon as the end of May, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The processor is Huawei’s most powerful AI semiconductor to date. According to the report, Huawei is hopeful that the chips will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 AI training chip, which it released in 2022. The Shenzhen-based firm boosts the chip’s performance by packing in more silicon. Shares of Nvidia were down about 3.5% by late Monday morning. The chip is in the early stages of development and will need to undergo testing with an initial batch of customers to measure its performance, the sources said. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it. The firm has been on a U.S.-trade blacklist for six years, and the U.S. restricts chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The tightening restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt blows to Nvidia by limiting its potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred the Santa Clara, California-based company from selling them in China. Beijing has slammed the U.S.’ approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $2.6 trillion. But its shares are down 22.5% this year in the face of Trump’s escalating trade war with China. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: What is the Inverse Cramer Meme? Jokes About Following the Opposite of Jim Cramer's Investment Advice, Explained

Adam Downer • 6 years ago Mateus Lima • about a month ago Matt Schimkowitz • 6 years ago Owen Carry • 4 days ago Sakshi Rakshale • about a month ago Published April 27, 2025 Jim Cramer is one of the most recognizable figures in American finance media, known for his energetic stock picks and bold predictions on CNBC's Mad Money. Over the years, however, a growing number of investors and internet users have noticed a pattern: Cramer's recommendations during crucial market moments have not performed well. In response, online communities developed the "Inverse Cramer" meme and slang term, a running joke and informal strategy suggesting that doing the opposite of Cramer’s advice could be more profitable. Here’s how the meme started, why it spread, and what it looks like today. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money since March 2005, is infamous for dramatic, sometimes ill-fated investment advice. During the 2008 financial crisis, Cramer advised buying Bear Stearns, just weeks before it collapsed. He also encouraged holding onto Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before their infamous downfalls. A clip of the show uploaded by YouTuber politiclips on March 17th, 2008, has over 500,000 views 17 years later. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2009 that betting against Cramer’s "buys" could net a 25 percent return in a month. CBS News confirmed similar findings in 2012, with a 22 percent portfolio gain in just 22 days by doing the opposite. The "Inverse Cramer" meme suggests that one can succeed in the stock market simply by doing the opposite of Jim Cramer’s advice. While jokes about this date back to 2008, the phrase "Inverse Cramer" first surfaced on Twitter via @WSBConsensus on October 10, 2017, in a post about shorting NVIDIA and going long on AMD, which echoed in a popular /r/Amd thread on Reddit later that month. Don't forget the infamous "Inverse Cramer" Short $NVDA Long $AMD #BuyNVDAPuts #BuyAMDCalls $MU $APPL $GOOGL $HMNY https://t.co/9QUvAetUTv — WallStreetBets & Co. (@WSBConsensus) October 10, 2017 The idea found a home in online finance communities like the subreddit /r/WallStreetBets and FinTwit by 2019, where posts joking about "inversing" Cramer routinely earned hundreds to thousands of upvotes. As Cramer’s misfires piled up, the meme matured from a casual jab into a half-serious investment philosophy. On December 15th, 2021, Twitter user @iAnonPatriot posted a screenshot of Cramer tweeting negatively about AMC Entertainment stock. Despite Cramer’s warning, AMC’s share price rose significantly, leading @iAnonPatriot to caption it with sarcasm and highlight the inverse trend. The next day, on December 16th, Redditor /u/jsza87 posted to /r/wallstreetbets with the title "Always inverse Jim Cramer," gathering over 8,000 upvotes since. The post featured a collage of stock tickers that all declined sharply after Cramer had recommended them. By early March 2023, the joke had grown large enough that Redditor /u/HYPED_UP_ON_CHARTS announced, "The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived," on /r/wallstreetbets. The post, which earned over 9,000 upvotes in the last two years, presented an ETF that allowed people to automatically short stocks recommended by Cramer. What started as a meme has turned into an actual, tradable financial strategy. The meme stayed relevant through new market events even into this year. For instance, on April 5th, 2025, after Cramer warned of a coming "Black Monday" stock crash, X user @fprosk joked, "We are really testing the limits of the Reverse Jim Cramer now," gathering over 50,000 likes in just a couple of days. Finally, the meme broke into even bigger mainstream attention when Elon Musk referenced it. On April 25th, 2025, after Jim Cramer said during a CNBC segment, "I'm putting my chips on Elon Musk," Musk responded on X with, "Uh oh 😬 Inverse Cramer is tough karma to overcome! I’m calling weekend reviews with Autopilot to accelerate progress." For the full history of Inverse Cramer, be sure to check out Know Your Meme's encyclopedia entry for more information.

U.S. stocks were on track for a flat to slightly lower open Monday as investors geared up for a jam-packed week of earnings spanning pizza chains, semiconductor makers, and sanitation giants. Here are the stocks likely to dominate today’s headlines: Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificial intelligence chip designed to challenge some of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) top offerings, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ascend 910D represents a major step in China’s push to build a self-sufficient tech industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia shares fell about 1.5% in premarket trading following the report. Domino’s beat earnings expectations but missed on revenue, posting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. CEO Russell Weiner said the company is staying focused on “controlling what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” while celebrating early progress under its “Hungry for MORE” five-year plan. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5%, while international same-store sales rose 3.7% excluding currency impacts. Domino’s stock slipped roughly 2% before the bell. Waste Management (WM+1.00%) will report after the close, with investors zeroing in on margin trends and pricing power. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15%) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80%) could provide a key window into how much R&D spending chipmakers are sustaining in a tighter environment. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28%), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44%), and Novartis (NVS-0.56%). Later in the week, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) are set to headline earnings after the bell Wednesday, offering critical updates on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital advertising trends. Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) and Apple (AAPL-0.39%) follow on Thursday, with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-0.82%) closing out the week on Friday — wrapping up one of the busiest earnings stretches of the year. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies’ leadership mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism falling to its lowest ratio since 2008.

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ-0.99%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM+1.00%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL-0.70%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP-0.42%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28%), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44%), and Novartis (NVS-0.56%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook — particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel. Later this week, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) report after the bell Wednesday, giving investors a read on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital ad trends. Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) and Apple (AAPL-0.39%) are on deck Thursday, while Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-0.82%) is set to follow on Friday, capping one of the biggest earnings weeks of the year.

Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchasers will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchasers at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire’s diversified group of businesses.
