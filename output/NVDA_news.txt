Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/31/nvidia--magnificent-7-too-hot-to-handle/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: From GPUs to tokens – How Nvidia’s optimism might influence the Crypto AI sector
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/from-gpus-to-tokens-how-nvidias-optimism-might-influence-the-crypto-ai-sector/
Time Published: 2025-08-30T21:00:16Z

The Crypto AI sector has not kept pace with the wider altcoin market’s price gains. Nvidia’s fiscal report has projected sustained revenue growth for the next quarter, while tech companies like MongoDB and Pure Storage closed out a bullish week. Can this affect the Crypto AI sector’s sentiment? Nvidia [NVDA] is in the news today after it reported its Q2 fiscal results for the second quarter ended the 27th of July, 2025. Its revenue of $46.7 billion was up 6% from the previous quarter and 56% higher than a year ago. Its outlook for the third quarter remains bullish, with revenue expected to be as high as $54 billion. Referring to the Nvidia GPU architecture, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.” He added that the “NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary” and that the AI race os on. The bullish commentary and the company’s aggressive share repurchase plans could be a sign of greater confidence. That’s not all though as demand hasn’t been slowing down. In fact, the strong growth in the company’s revenue seemed to be in contrast with signs of fatigue in AI-related stocks. Following the fiscal report release earlier in the week, NVDA’s stock saw a 5.95% correction. It fell from Thursday’s high at $184.13 to Friday’s low of $173.17. The generative AI boom in 2022, after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, meant that GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and cloud vendors like Microsoft and Google were big winners. There have been some recent winners too, with Enterprise technology company MongoDB noting a 45.7% rally last week. CEO Dev Ittycheria, speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, said, “You start to see deployments of agents to automate back office, maybe automate sales and marketing, but it’s still not yet kind of full force in the enterprise.” This statement captures the cautious optimism across the market. As far as Crypto AI tokens are concerned, it could take some time for decentralized AI solutions to gain traction. However, when traditional AI players such as NVDA see a hike in bullish sentiment, there will be some impact on the crypto AI sector. Source: TAO/USDT on TradingView At the time of writing, Bittensor [TAO], the biggest crypto AI token by market capitalization, was down 56% from its December high of $748. Bitcoin’s [BTC] performance since April has not been enough to lead TAO token to recovery either. Source: RENDER/USDT on TradingView Similarly, Render [RENDER] has depreciated by 70% from its December high of $11.9. Together, these two tokens highlighted how the AI token market sentiment may be risk-averse. Even though the altcoin market cap, including Ethereum [ETH], has expanded by nearly 60% since April’s lows, the AI sector has only managed 30%. AI tokens come with high risks, but also high rewards for buyers. Their performance would be dependent on the crypto market sentiment, as well as the wider market’s outlook on AI.

Major U.S. equities indexes retreated from recent highs as investors digested fresh economic data ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Friday's move lower came after the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—a gauge of inflation closely monitored by the Federal Reserve—showed a month-over-month uptick in "core" PCE inflation in July. The S&P 500 and the Dow declined 0.2% and 0.6%, after closing Thursday at record levels. Underperformance from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 1.2%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) tumbled 8.9%, suffering the heaviest daily loss of any stock in the S&P 500. Although strong demand related to artificial intelligence helped the maker of personal computers, servers, and other IT hardware topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates, Dell's guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below consensus estimates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares dropped 7.1%. The decline reversed solid gains posted by the stock in the prior session. The cosmetics retailer late yesterday posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter and boosted its full-year revenue guidance. Ulta faces continued uncertainty related to potential tariff impacts. Although many stocks with exposure to AI initially gained ground in the wake of the latest earnings report from AI semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), the rally lost steam on Friday. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the enterprise software firm that has recently announced major investments in AI and cloud infrastructure, slipped 5.9%, while shares of AI-focused server manufacturer Super Micro Computer (SMCI) ended 5.5% lower. Autodesk (ADSK) shares bucked the downward pressure on the broader tech sector and software industries, jumping 9.1% to log the S&P 500's top performance. The engineering and design software provider topped second-quarter sales and adjusted profit estimates and lifted its full-year forecasts. Demand for its design software for AI data centers helped underpin the performance. Shares of Cooper Cos. (COO), a medical device maker focused vision care and surgical products, advanced 4.4%. With the move higher heading into the holiday weekend, Cooper stock clawed back a portion of the heavy losses posted Thursday after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates and lowered its full-year sales forecast. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock also staged a recovery on Friday from a post-earnings swoon suffered earlier in the week, adding 3.6%. The maker of its namesake fruit spreads as well as the Hostess snack cake brand reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter and noted that tariffs were having a negative impact on its coffee business. On its earnings call, the company said it anticipates additional price hikes as it navigates tariff-related cost pressure.

The chips are down to close out August. A range of chip stocks slid Friday, weighing on the major U.S. equities indexes in the last trading session of the month. China concerns weighed on the sector, but that wasn't the only factor that pulled shares lower. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) among its biggest decliners. The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.

Title: Bitcoin Miner IREN's AI Push Gains Momentum, Price Target Hiked 60% to $37: Canaccord

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity. The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams. In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75. The company’s mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry’s most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels. Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million. On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs. With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.

Title: Dell Stock Drops as Soft Q3 Profit Projection Offsets Strong AI Demand

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit. The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year. Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand. "We've now shipped $10 billion of AI solutions in the first half of FY26, surpassing all shipments in FY25. This helped deliver another record revenue quarter in our Servers and Networking business, which grew 69%," COO Jeff Clarke said. "Demand for our AI solutions continues to be exceptional, and we're raising our AI server shipment guidance for FY26 to $20 billion" from $15 billion-plus. Citi analysts said in a note Friday that Dell's Q2 PC segment sales were below consensus forecasts "by 3% or roughly $357.0 million," and that it "likely lost share in PCs." It added that the increase in its AI server shipment guidance is good news for Nvidia (NVDA), which makes up 88% of its sales, and Micron Technology (MU), at 17%. "Dell expects the traditional server business to grow in the 2nd half but below their prior expectations from the beginning of the year," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.
