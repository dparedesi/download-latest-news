The Nasdaq Composite index fell almost 1.4% on Tuesday after February consumer confidence missed expectations, coming in at 98.3 compared with the consensus of 103.0, and down from 105.3 in January — the worst decline since August. U.S. government debt rallied and the dollar weakened. The Nasdaq fell about 260 points. The S&P 500 dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by about 160 points . Money markets are now fully pricing a more than two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, Bloomberg News reports, even after 12-month average inflation expectations surged to 6% from 5.2%, partly driven by concern about tariffs. The Magnificent 7 shares declined more than 2% as a group. Nvidia (NVDA+2.61%) and Super Micro (SMCI+13.27%) shares fell in New York trading on a report — following declines in Japanese chipmakers including Tokyo Electron in Tokyo — that the U.S. is seeking tighter chip restrictions on China. Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy (MSTR-0.22%), plunged 11%, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $88,000, with other cryptocurrencies pacing the decline. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token. Chegg (CHGG-2.34%) stock fell 33% after the online learning platform filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively affected its traffic and revenue. Home Depot (HD-0.74%) rose 2.8% after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year. Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Hims & Hers (HIMS+1.64%) stock dove 22% even after the millennial-focused telehealth company reported soaring sales for 2024 last night.

Title: Nvidia earnings have analysts optimistic the DeepSeek selloff was just a blip

As Nvidia (NVDA+2.61%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-1.67%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+2.26%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+0.73%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY+2.74%), Alibaba (BABA+3.94%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+1.62%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC+2.91%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG-2.34%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-3.33%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+1.86%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD-0.74%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+2.61%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+13.27%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR-0.22%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token.

Title: Nvidia investors' call gives the chip giant a chance to tell backers why they're wrong about DeepSeek's impact
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/deepseek-impact-nvidia-investors-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T20:55:44Z

When Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, the chip giant will have the chance to tell investors why it thinks their intense reaction to the rise of DeepSeek was a mistake — or change the subject entirely. Heading into 2025, Nvidia's rule looked unassailable as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and others lined up for its chips. Then the Chinese startup DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model with benchmark results to rival OpenAI's o1 model. Critically, R1 was said to be produced with fewer and less powerful chips than o1. "DeepSeek's remarkable feat has shaken the industry's assumptions about how much capital or GPU chips a company needs to stay ahead of the competition," Barclays analysts wrote last month. Though Nvidia has largely recovered from markets' reaction to DeepSeek — the chip firm lost $600 billion in market capitalization in one day, in the biggest single drop in US market history — CEO Jensen Huang will need to show investors that the party is nowhere near over and that the promise of AI isn't overhyped. Huang previewed his argument at a virtual event broadcast Thursday, where he said investors had misinterpreted the signals of DeepSeek. As Nvidia prepares to address investors officially for the first time since the DeepSeek saga, here's what to look out for in its earnings. Analysts predict that Nvidia's revenue, especially in its all-important data center business, will keep rising — bolstered by coming data center buildouts. Nvidia's customers are still lining up. OpenAI's Stargate project is expected to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US. Meta has forecast an additional $65 billion in spending on data centers this year. And Amazon recently forecast spending $100 billion on computing power. It will offer Nvidia fresh evidence to present to investors concerned that DeepSeek's claim to use chips more efficiently — a key driver in lowering costs — would hurt demand. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed 'revolutionary' optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors in early February. Model improvements are another favorable piece of evidence for Nvidia. Grok 3, xAI's latest model, has received praise for its performance. Musk's firms also recently collaborated on a second data center with roughly 12,000 Nvidia GPUs, Business Insider exclusively reported. Musk has been aggressively adding to the fleet of GPU-packed data centers supporting Grok, suggesting a link between progress and infrastructure. Morgan Stanley analysts told investors in a note last week that model builders and hyperscalers still had their eyes on artificial general intelligence and that cheaper, highly functional models like DeepSeek wouldn't affect that pursuit. Nvidia's latest and most powerful chip series, Blackwell, has struggled with a slow rollout due to manufacturing and overheating issues. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to report a strong ramp-up. "Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters," Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, said in an investor note last week. UBS's Timothy Arcuri wrote that after much consternation, investor fears of a botched rollout were relaxing, and strong sales numbers could put them fully at ease. UBS analysts also said the fourth quarter was the last in which Blackwell chips wouldn't make up the majority of Nvidia's GPU sales. Investors are likely to favor that shift because Blackwell brings with it higher profit margins. Nvidia's buzzy GTC conference is set to take place in San Jose, California, next month, marking the first anniversary of Blackwell's debut. Further growth in inference demand would also be a point for Huang's theory of investor error surrounding the DeepSeek rout. Demand for inference, the process of using and improving models once they've been trained, increases when consumers and businesses find value in AI tools. Investors will likely want to see the share of AI workloads continue to shift to inference, which also requires GPUs to run. On the company's latest call, in November, Huang repeatedly said inference across Nvidia's platforms was growing. Growth in the software layers of Nvidia's tech stack would be a good sign, too. This would suggest maturity in AI products and lend strength to a part of its business that's potentially even more difficult to compete with than the chips themselves. "What Nvidia talks about on its long-term moats and its possible deployment on the AI application side probably matters more this time," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Investors will also be looking for any signals from Nvidia about the company's approach to China as President Donald Trump threatens to upend business relations with the country. Just before the end of his term, President Joe Biden initiated new regulations, now in a 120-day comment period, on the export of high-powered chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Many policy analysts expect Trump to allow the rules to take effect, as they align with his "America First" agenda, though Trump hasn't directly addressed them. Trump last month described AI leadership as critical to ensuring "economic and national security." Last month, Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, the home of Nvidia's chip manufacturing partner, TSMC. Tariffs could lead to increased costs for Nvidia. Huang met with the president at the White House last month, but neither party provided details of the discussion. Though Nvidia's share price has recovered much of its DeepSeek-induced losses, the $3 trillion juggernaut faces various headwinds. Huang's job on Wednesday will be to reassure investors that those headwinds will be mild and reaffirm that Nvidia remains fundamental to the AI story. Jump to

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Bybit Hack Fails to Ruffle Feathers, Traders Eye SOL ETF

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

The company will likely continue to report robust demand for its products and a compelling outlook. The stock is likely to pop - per our data on how Nvidia reacts post earnings. However, there is a larger risk to the US economy, worth factoring right now. What is that? See more on Trefis.com Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia. When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table.

Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. • NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days. • During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover.

Nvidia (NVDA+2.61%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO+4.11%) and Micron (MU+4.39%) also gained. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-1.67%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+0.39%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF+1.62%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

Title: NVIDIA To Surge 20% With Earnings?

CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, an Nvidia logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock?

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek

Nvidia (NVDA+2.61%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+2.26%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+0.39%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

Title: Jensen Huang Donates a Lifeline to San Francisco’s Last Nonprofit Arts College

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:37:16Z

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.
