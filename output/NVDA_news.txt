Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchases will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchases at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire’s diversified group of businesses.

More of their meeting at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on April 21, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 40% or more in the upcoming months? Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that’s like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don’t be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over. This contrarian view isn’t just gut instinct - it’s part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks. If you believe markets are rational and always priced right, consider this: the U.S. may be running a demand deficit far more dangerous than its trade deficit. Read: The Real U.S Trade Deficit Armageddon Let’s be real - Nvidia has a boom-bust pattern that’s hard to ignore. Every time the hype gets too hot - whether it’s crypto, gaming, or AI - Nvidia’s stock overshoots and pays for it later. What makes you think it will be different this time? Nvidia is a classic example of how you have to bear extreme volatility while chasing returns. We combine different categories of stocks to lower the volatility while maintaining exposure to the upside in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts’ expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The tech titan reported revenue of $90.23 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $34.54 billion, or $2.81 per share, compared to $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier, also topping Wall Street’s estimates. Google Cloud revenue rose 28% to $12.3 billion, while Search & Other segment revenue grew 10% to $50.7 billion. Alphabet also raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to 21 cents, and announced an additional $70 billion in stock buybacks. Alphabet's Class A shares rose close to 5% in after-hours trading. The stock was down about 16% for 2025 through Thursday’s close. CEO Sundar Pichai said Search growth was driven by "engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" after launching in May 2024. On the company's earnings call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said the quarter "marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.” Alphabet reiterated its plans to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, most of which is expected to go toward building out the company's AI infrastructure. “We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization,” CFO Anat Ashkenazi said, adding that Alphabet ended the quarter with more Cloud demand than it had capacity. The investments in AI infrastructure, “should help us have a more resilient organization, irrespective of macroeconomic conditions," Ashkenazi said. Pichai also gave Nvidia (NVDA) a shoutout during Thursday's call, saying Alphabet’s relationship with the AI chipmaker “continues to be a key advantage for our customers.” Alphabet was the first cloud provider to offer certain Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, Pichai said, and will offer its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, which are expected in 2026.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These picks diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services, and are ... More anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models. The market landscape in early May 2025 is characterized by uncertainty and fragmentation, driven by a volatile combination of geopolitical instability, shifting sector dynamics and policy unpredictability. Economic rifts have deepened in recent weeks, driven in part by an unclear tariff framework and a lack of cohesive economic direction from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. With inflation pressures unresolved and confidence in long-term policy planning waning, investors are navigating a fragile environment where resilience is just as important as opportunity. This article highlights five standout investment opportunities for the current market climate. The list features a balanced mix of growth-oriented innovators that have seen recent corrections, alongside dependable dividend-paying leaders with strong balance sheets and defensible business models. In an era marked by dislocation and doubt, each of these companies offers a compelling case built on financial durability, competitive edge and potential catalysts poised to reward patient investors. This selection process balances fundamentals, technicals and macro context. For growth stocks, we focused on industry leaders with strong business models that have pulled back on sentiment, rather than fundamentals, offering attractive long-term entry points. Defensive picks emphasize dividend strength, valuation discipline and resilience across cycles. Each name was vetted for cash flow, balance sheet health and near-term catalysts. The result: a portfolio built for both upside and protection in an uncertain 2025 market. Tesla has evolved from a pure electric vehicle manufacturer into a comprehensive company focused on sustainable energy and artificial intelligence. While its automotive division continues to produce the Models 3, Y, S and the recently launched Cybertruck, as well as the $28,000 Model 2, Tesla has diversified into energy generation and storage with its Solar Roof, Powerwall and utility-scale battery installations. The company's vertical integration spans battery production through the Gigafactories, autonomous driving capabilities via its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and an expanding services ecosystem. Tesla's AI initiatives have accelerated following the commercial launch of its Optimus humanoid robot and Dojo supercomputer applications. The company maintains production facilities across four continents, with its newest Gigafactory in Indonesia having broken ground in late 2024. Despite facing intensifying competition in the electric vehicle (EV) space, particularly from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers' electric offerings, Tesla maintains significant advantages in manufacturing efficiency, battery technology and software capabilities. CEO Elon Musk's recent reorganizational efforts have focused on streamlining operations and accelerating the company's artificial intelligence and robotics divisions while maintaining automotive innovation. The decline follows multiple headwinds: lower-than-expected Q1 deliveries, intensifying global EV price competition, and delays in the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service. Compounding these challenges is growing investor unease over Elon Musk’s political behavior and public promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which many view as symbolic of his broader attempts to undermine government institutions. This has alienated a significant segment of the political left, including many upper-middle-class Democrats (Tesla’s core market), who increasingly distrust Musk and his leadership team. His involvement in multiple non-core ventures, including X (formerly Twitter) and other business interests, has further fueled concerns about diminished focus during a pivotal period for Tesla’s operational performance. Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report, released April 22, underscored these concerns. The company missed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion. Total revenue declined 9%, and net income dropped 71% from the prior year. Tesla cited factory upgrades, lower average selling prices, and incentives as key drags. The company also refrained from reaffirming its 2025 growth guidance, instead postponing updates until Q2. Despite this, shares saw a slight after-hours rebound following President Trump’s reassurance on Fed leadership—a sign of the stock’s continued political sensitivity. Yet not all is bleak. Tesla’s energy storage segment grew 67% year-over-year, and the company confirmed it remains on track to pilot both its robotaxi service in Austin and humanoid robot production in Fremont later this year. Meanwhile, the launch of its affordable Model 2 and the ongoing expansion of AI and Dojo infrastructure offer long-term upside. With $26.3 billion in cash and around $13 billion in debt, Tesla maintains the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges. For investors with a long horizon, the recent selloff may offer an entry point—albeit one that now demands careful monitoring of political, regulatory, and operational risks. NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming graphics card company into the world's leading provider of computing platforms for artificial intelligence and accelerated computing applications. The company's GPU technology has become the foundation of the AI revolution, with its data center segment now representing over 65% of total revenue. NVIDIA's hardware offerings span the entire computing spectrum, from GeForce gaming GPUs and workstation-class Quadro cards to data center-focused Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The company has expanded its reach beyond hardware through CUDA, its parallel computing platform, and an evolving software ecosystem that encompasses AI frameworks, digital twin simulations and enterprise solutions. In recent quarters, NVIDIA has accelerated its system integration efforts, introducing pre-configured AI systems, such as the DGX SuperPOD, as well as specialized solutions for various industries, including healthcare and telecommunications. The company's collaboration with leading cloud service providers has expanded, with specialized instances featuring NVIDIA's latest GPU architectures available across all major platforms. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's automotive computing platform continues gaining traction with automakers pursuing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving capabilities, creating another growth vector beyond its core markets. NVIDIA has pulled back more than 30% from its highs, but strong fundamentals and expanding markets make the dip a compelling opportunity. In its latest report, revenue surged 122% YoY with rising margins, countering fears of AI saturation or chip oversupply. With its next-gen Blackwell architecture launching in Q2 2025, NVIDIA is set to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure. Its edge lies in both cutting-edge hardware and a dominant software ecosystem that locks in customers and pricing power. Despite export-related headwinds, its strategic role in U.S. tech leadership remains intact. With projected earnings growth of over 40% through 2027 and rising shareholder returns, NVIDIA continues to offer a rare opportunity for long-term upside. Johnson & Johnson remains a global healthcare leader following its strategic transformation through the Kenvue consumer health spinoff, completed in 2023. The streamlined company now focuses exclusively on its pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which together represent cutting-edge healthcare innovation and stable, recession-resistant revenue streams. J&J's pharmaceutical division boasts a robust portfolio of treatments across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and cardiovascular health, including blockbuster drugs such as Stelara, Darzalex and Tremfya. Its medical device segment provides essential surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, vision care products and interventional solutions. The company's research and development capabilities remain industry-leading, with an annual R&D investment exceeding $15 billion and a pipeline featuring over 100 clinical development programs. J&J's acquisition strategy has been disciplined yet opportunistic, with recent purchases strengthening its capabilities in robotic surgery, cardiovascular devices and cell therapy platforms. Following the resolution of major talc litigation through its controversial Texas Two-Step bankruptcy strategy in late 2024, the company has reduced a significant overhang that had suppressed shareholder value for years. Johnson & Johnson blends defensive stability with meaningful growth potential—ideal for today’s uncertain market. Backed by 63 straight years of dividend increases and a 3.2% yield, JNJ generates strong cash flow and trades at a modest 14.8x forward earnings. Growth drivers include a robust pharmaceutical pipeline (targeting $15B in new revenue by 2028), expansion in oncology and cell therapy, and a rebound in elective procedures. Its Ottava robotic surgery platform just gained FDA approval. With $19 billion in net cash, JNJ has the flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or further dividend hikes, making it a rare combination of resilience and upside. Procter & Gamble maintains its position as the world's premier consumer packaged goods company, with an unparalleled portfolio of essential household brands across categories including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric care, home care and baby care. The company's flagship brands—including Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Charmin and Dawn—hold leading market positions in their respective segments across more than 180 countries. The company's operational excellence initiative, launched in 2023, has generated approximately $2.1 billion in annual cost savings through the implementation of manufacturing automation, supply chain optimization and digital transformation. These efficiencies have enabled P&G to navigate inflationary pressures while continuing to invest in product innovation and marketing effectiveness. Procter & Gamble is a strong defensive play for 2025, backed by essential products, pricing power and a history of consistent performance. With 5.2% organic sales growth, 33% of sales from emerging markets, and 18% from e-commerce, P&G continues to expand through premiumization and innovation. Financially, it’s disciplined, with 68 consecutive years of dividend increases and steady buybacks. Recent gains in the fabric care, health, and home categories demonstrate resilience in the face of intense competition. For investors seeking stability, income, and moderate growth, P&G remains a reliable cornerstone. Waste Management is North America's largest environmental services provider, serving over 21 million customers across municipal, commercial and residential sectors. Its vast network — spanning over 500 collection sites, 260 landfills and 140 recycling facilities—creates high barriers to entry and drives efficiency through vertical integration and dense routing. The company has strategically expanded its sustainability initiatives, positioning itself as both a waste collector and a materials management company, with a focus on extracting maximum value from waste streams. WM's recycling operations process nearly 12 million tons of materials annually, while its renewable energy projects generate enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. The company's recent strategic acquisitions, including the $4.6 billion purchase of Stericycle, completed in January 2025, have strengthened its position in specialized, higher-margin waste streams such as medical, hazardous and industrial waste, complementing its core municipal solid waste business. Waste Management offers a rare blend of recession-resistant stability and growth potential. With ~70% of revenue from long-term contracts tied to inflation, WM enjoys steady cash flow and strong pricing power. Operational efficiency gains have expanded EBITDA margins by 180 bps since 2023, providing downside protection. But WM isn’t just defensive—it’s growing. Renewable natural gas projects, the Stericycle acquisition and improved recycling margins are driving revenue and diversification. With rising free cash flow, a 10% dividend increase in Q1 2025 and ongoing buybacks, WM delivers income, growth and environmental impact, setting it apart from traditional utilities. Bottom Line The five highlighted stocks—Tesla, NVIDIA, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Waste Management—offer a balanced approach for navigating the market challenges of May 2025. Tesla and NVIDIA offer growth potential following sharp pullbacks, while J&J, P&G and Waste Management provide defensive stability and income. Together, they diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services—anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models.

Title: An Apple Bull Trimmed Its Price Target on the Stock Today. Here's Why.

One of Wall Street's Apple bulls pared their optimism on the tech giant's shares today. Bank of America analysts on Thursday maintained their "buy" rating on Apple (AAPL) stock, but they also trimmed their price target by $10, lowering it to $240. (That's still above the Street's mean near $234, according to Visible Alpha.) Their reasons: tariff-related costs that could weigh on margins, along with concerns that delayed AI features could dent device demand. The stock, meanwhile, was ticking higher as broader markets rose. Apple's shares were recently up 0.6% to above $205. Apple is set to join the parade of Magnificent Seven tech companies to report earnings, with its next set of results due next Thursday after the closing bell. Bank of America expects some tariff-driven "pull forward" to have helped lift sales during the most recent quarter, but they're cutting longer-term sales estimates "to adjust for higher costs of navigating a more complex supply chain and for delays in launching an AI enabled Siri." Apple's shares are down about 18% so far this year, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Research firm Vanda earlier this week noted recent net selling of Apple by retail investors even as net buying continued elsewhere—such as shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). "Individuals continue to give off capitulation-lite signals, but a full-blown unwind remains moderately far on the horizon," Vanda wrote in a Wednesday note.
