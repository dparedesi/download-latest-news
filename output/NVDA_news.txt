Title: AMD downgraded after BI report on weak demand for its AI chips among AWS customers

Bank of America downgraded AMD after a Business Insider report raised concerns about demand for the tech company's AI chips. Analysts at BofA cut AMD shares to a "neutral," citing "higher competitive risk" in the AI market, according to an analyst note published on Monday. BofA analysts also lowered their AMD GPU sales forecast for next year to $8 billion, from $8.9 billion, implying a roughly 4% market share. AMD's stock dropped roughly 5.6% on Monday, after falling about 2% on Friday. Its shares are down about 5% so far this year. The declines follow BI's report on Friday that said Amazon Web Services was "not yet" seeing strong enough customer demand to deploy AMD's AI chips through its cloud platform. Bank of America cited this AWS customer-demand issue, alongside Nvidia's dominance and the growing preference for custom chips from Marvell and Broadcom, as factors limiting AMD's growth potential. "Recently largest cloud customer Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD," the Bank of America note said, referring to AWS's in-house AI chip Trainium and its close partnerships with Marvell and Nvidia. Spokespeople from Amazon and AMD declined to comment on the story last week. After publication of both articles, the companies got back in touch with BI and shared comments. In an email to BI, AMD's spokesperson said it has a "great relationship" with AWS. "We are actively engaged with AWS and end customers on AI opportunities," the spokesperson said. AWS's spokesperson said in an email to BI, "AWS and AMD work together closely, as we continue to make AWS the best place to run AMD silicon. Based on the success of AMD CPUs on AWS, we are actively looking at offering AMD's AI chips." AMD recently increased its GPU sales forecast, just a year after launching its line of AI chips. But its GPU market share is still far behind Nvidia's. Bank of America said AMD could still succeed in the AI chip market, in part due to Nvidia's supply constraints and premium pricing, making it a strong alternative, especially for internal cloud workloads. It also said AMD is well positioned in the server chip market, as rival Intel continues to struggle. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: China Probes Nvidia Amid Escalating A.I. Chip Tensions With US: What to Know

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:12:44Z

Just two weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang lauded China’s contributions to A.I. research in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company amid escalating geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and uncertainties around the incoming Trump administration.

You can opt out anytime. China’s State Administration of Market Regulation is looking into Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli company that makes computer networking equipment, Chinese media reported today (Dec. 9). China approved Nvidia’s $6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox under the condition that the Israeli company would provide samples of new products to rivals within 90 days of making them available to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg, which noted that China’s approval was needed due to the size of its economy and semiconductor market. The deal also received merger control approval from authorities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico and the European Union. In a statement to Observer, Nvidia said it is happy to answer any questions regulators have about its business. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” said the chipmaker. “We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business.” The investigation is the latest jab in an escalating semiconductor battle between the U.S. and China, which was described by China’s Commerce Ministry as an “abuse of control measures” and a “typical act of economic coercion.” Earlier this month, the Biden administration enacted another round of chip export controls in the country, following previous efforts to curb China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. The country retaliated by banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony and other superhard materials to the U.S. These materials have various high-tech and military applications. Previous measures from the U.S. have limited Nvidia from selling advanced GPUs to China since 2022. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to maintain these measures and the Biden administration’s tough-on-China stance. Nvidia shares fell more than 3 percent today in response to the news. The past year has been lucrative for the chipmaker, which has seen its stock surging by nearly 200 percent to claim a market cap of $3.38 trillion, making it the world’s second most valuable company behind Apple (AAPL) and boosting the wealth of its founder and CEO to an estimated $120.5 billion. Surging demand for the GPUs underpinning A.I. applications has propelled Nvidia to become the industry leader in A.I. chips, with a 70 percent to 95 percent share of the market, according to Mizuho Securities. The chipmaker, which reported a 94 percent jump in revenue year-over-year to $35 billion during the last quarter, counts tech giants like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) among its largest clients. In China, however, Nvidia has lost ground amid tough export controls. Its sales in the country made up 15 percent of its total sales in the quarter ended September, a dip from 26 percent a year ago. Huang himself has urged for a positive relationship between the U.S. and China when it comes to technological advances, lauding China’s contributions to A.I. research. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” the CEO said while receiving an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology last month.

Title: China levels anti-trust charges against Nvidia – country accuses chipmaker of violating anti-monopoly regulations, examining the $7 billion Mellanox acquisition

Nvidia's stock dipped by 2% as news broke this morning. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As the trade wars escalate between the US and China, Nvidia has found itself in the crossfire following accusations of possible anti-trust violations by the Chinese Government – per local media. The spotlight is on Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox – a conditional approval of which was granted, provided Nvidia would follow strict anti-monopoly guidelines. Following similar inquiries by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) a few months back, Nvidia is now taking flak from both sides. The probe scrutinizes Team Green’s purchase of the Israeli-American networking firm Mellanox in 2020. Mellanox is the backbone of Nvidia's AI servers, allowing multiple GPUs within a DGX system to be connected via InfiniBand and Ethernet switches. The $7 billion acquisition was approved by Chinese authorities, stipulating that Nvidia will not use this partnership to discriminate against domestic firms. Likewise, Nvidia was obligated to notify rivals about upcoming products within 90 days. Coming hot on the heels of another wave of sanctions on 140 Chinese companies—now prohibited from importing High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) among other chip-making tools—a retaliatory response was expected. This appears to be part of China’s strategy to fight back against US sanctions, with recent reports suggesting a 20% price cut on domestic goods to counteract Trump’s tariffs. When asked to comment on the matter by PCMag, Nvidia said, "Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." Since the news broke, Nvidia's stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted by 2% in pre-market trading early in the morning. These regulations are not mere formalities, as evidenced by their impacts on many multi-trillion dollar corporations. Google, for example, is under serious pressure from the DoJ and could be forced to sell off Google Chrome for $20 billion over complaints of monopolistic practices. Nonetheless, it could take months or even years before a conclusion is reached, giving Nvidia some breathing space. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: Nvidia stock falls almost 3% as it faces an antitrust probe in China

Nvidia’s (NVDA-2.69%) shares fell by almost 3% during mid-day trading on Monday after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker. Fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.36%) and Marvell (MRVL-0.37%) also saw their shares fall by 4.4% and 5.2%, respectively. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday it has launched an investigation into the U.S.-based chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws with its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, according to China Central Television. Nvidia bought the chip designer for $6.9 billion in 2020 and was given conditional approval by Chinese authorities that included a requirement to not bundle or tie together its products with Mellanox. The two chip companies were also required to continue supplying on fair terms and to make sure technology was compatible with chips manufactured by Chinese firms. Other measures were designed to address tightening U.S. export controls targeting China’s chip firms. In September, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) were accused by Texas-based startup Xockets of monopolistic practices, patent infringement, and violating federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that Nvidia has infringed on Xockets’ patents since its acquisition of Mellanox, which had adopted the startup’s technology in 2016 without its knowledge or permission. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia and Microsoft of infringing on Xockets’ patent for advanced data processing units, or DPUs, “that enable accelerated computing and artificial intelligence” in data centers. Meanwhile, the Biden administration recently announced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said. Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were also added to the U.S. trade blacklist.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped 2.5% on Monday after China opened an antitrust investigation into the chip giant amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over artificial intelligence dominance. The probe is aimed at Nvidia's practices regarding possible anti-monopoly violations. It is also set to examine its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, a purchase that was approved by China's State Administration for Market Regulation under the condition that the chipmaker avoid discriminating against Chinese companies. According to a Chinese media report, the government believes Nvidia’s $7 billion purchase of the Israeli computer networking equipment maker may have violated Beijing's anti-monopoly rules. In a statement released on Monday morning, an Nvidia spokesperson wrote, "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The probe comes about a week after the Biden administration implemented another round of semiconductor export restrictions aimed at limiting China's access to advanced chips. The latest US measures include curbing high-bandwidth memory chips shipped to China, crucial components for AI training. “As China continues to struggle to keep up with the most leading-edge AI chips, they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down," Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning (video above). The Chinese probe against the most important US chipmaker also comes ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Trump has threatened increased tariffs as part of his policy. "This isn’t just a regulatory issue; it’s a calculated geopolitical manoeuvre," Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, wrote on Monday. "China is sending a strong message that it won’t hesitate to push back, and Nvidia’s targeting is a harbinger of more aggressive measures to come." Nvidia shares have not participated in the overall Trump post-election rally over the past month. The stock is up slightly more than 1% since Trump's win. Nvidia stock is up almost 190% so far this year. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

US stocks struggled for a foothold on Monday as Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped amid a Chinese antitrust probe while investors looked ahead at this week's expected inflation data that will set the stage for the Federal Reserve's final interest-rate decision of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose slightly, coming off a losing week for the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2%, in the wake of fresh records for both. The next test for Wall Street stocks comes in a consumer inflation report, seen as influential to the Federal Reserve's looming policy decision. The November Consumer Price Index on Wednesday will stress-test widespread expectation for a quarter-point rate cut on Dec. 18, after the latest monthly jobs report failed to shake that conviction. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares slipped after China opened a probe into the chipmaker for potential breaches of its anti-monopoly laws. The company's lead in AI chips has put it in the middle of the US-China wrangles over tech. But US-listed Chinese stocks popped after Beijing made its first move toward loosening monetary policy in over a decade, signaling more and bolder stimulus is on the way. Shares in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) and XPeng (XPEV, 9868.HK) were among the premarket gainers, after stocks in Hong Kong jumped. Markets appear to be taking the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria in stride, with haven asset gold (GC=F) rising modestly.

Title: Nvidia Stock Slips as Chinese Regulators Announce Anti-Monopoly Probe

Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved lower Monday after China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it is investigating the chipmaking giant for potential violations of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The antitrust regulator said Monday that it is looking into Nvidia over the chipmaker's 2020 acquisition of Israeli-American networking hardware maker Mellanox Technologies. SAMR said it "is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law," according to a translation from CNBC. In a statement provided to Investopedia, a company spokesperson wrote, "NVIDIA wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The $6.9 billion deal was announced in March 2019 and completed in April 2020, days after the same Chinese regulators signed off on the deal along with regulators in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Approval for the deal came with the conditions from Chinese regulators that Nvidia wouldn't discriminate against its companies and that Mellanox informed competitors of new products within 90 days of providing them to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Shares of the chipmaker that have surged thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom were down about 2% Monday afternoon to $139.61, but still have risen more than 180% since the start of the year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with a statement from Nvidia, additional information, and the latest share price movements.

Apple (AAPL+0.36%) is the best-managed company in the U.S., according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal. Of 250 companies, Nvidia (NVDA-2.69%) came in second, followed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%), Intel (INTC-3.08%), and Mastercard (MA+1.21%) to round out this year’s top five. The ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute, measures the effectiveness of corporate management using five areas: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength. This year, Apple and Nvidia knocked Microsoft out of the top spot — a position it has held for the last four years. Apple ranked highly for innovation and financial strength. Nvidia also ranked first for financial strength and second in employee engagement. The two companies have competed neck and neck to be the world’s most valuable company. Apple currently has a $3.67 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia is worth $3.49 trillion as of market close Friday. Shares of the chipmaker, which has seen a massive boost from artificial intelligence as demand for its AI chips booms, are up almost 200% this year. That’s compared with 30% for Apple. Microsoft has also seen healthy growth this year, adding almost 20% to its share value for a $3.30 trillion market cap. The company also ranked near the top in innovation and financial strength. Intel, on the other hand, has had a rocky year. Ranked as the fourth best-managed company in the country, Intel ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger last week after he failed to turn around the company’s performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA+1.14%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. Nonetheless, Intel ranked first across all 250 companies in social responsibility, and second in customer satisfaction.

Nvidia (NVDA-2.69%) is under investigation for allegedly violating anti-monopoly laws in China. The country’s State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a probe into whether Nvidia’s acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies violated anti-monopoly laws, according to a report from China Central Television on Monday. Shares of Nvidia fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading on Monday. The leading artificial intelligence chipmaker bought Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2020 after receiving conditional approval from Chinese authorities. Conditions included requirements that Nvidia and Mellanox not bundle or tie together products, continue to supply on fair terms, and ensure that chips from Chinese manufacturers worked with the technology. Other requirements were aimed at maintaining independence between the two firms, and lessening any potential impacts of export controls amid the trade war between the U.S. and China that began in 2018 under the first Trump administration. This comes as chip trade tensions between the two economic superpowers continue to escalate. Last week, the Department of Commerce introduced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said.d Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were added to the U.S. trade blacklist. According to the agency, the curbs are aimed at slowing China’s advanced AI developments that have “the potential to change the future of warfare” and “impairing” China’s development of its chip ecosystem. Last month, the U.S. reportedly asked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-3.63%), the world’s largest chipmaker, to stop sending its advanced AI chips to China. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: China is probing Nvidia in a major escalation of its chip wars with the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has opened an antitrust investigation into American chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power artificial intelligence, according to Chinese state media. The probe serves as the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance, which both the United States and China believe is crucial for national security. China Central Television in a report Monday said the Chinese government believes Nvidia’s purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox could violate the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though the report did not specify what the merger did to potentially break the law. China approved the acquisition in 2020. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell less than 2% in premarket trading Monday. The stock is among the hottest on the market, surging nearly 200% this year as the AI boom has fueled demand for the company’s chips. Its market value is more than $3 trillion, second only to Apple. The tit-for-tat China-US chip war has entered a new phase this month, after the Biden administration imposed another round of restrictions on high tech memory chip sales to China a week ago. The memory chips are different than the graphics processors Nvidia makes, but they are also crucial technology that helps power AI. The administration’s new export controls are the third such round of chip sales restrictions to China. The United States fears that China could use AI to gain a military advantage, and US Commerce Department officials said they believed the restrictions would slow China’s development of AI chips — and industry experts believe the US government’s plan will work. But China’s Commerce Ministry lambasted the United States’ restrictions, saying they pose “a significant threat” to the stability of global supply chains. China’s government retaliated last week by banning the sale of materials essential for manufacturing the chips, including germanium and gallium. A year ago, China had curbed the sale of those materials but created loopholes that allowed for some sales to continue. Those have now been closed. Senior US officials have also accused China of stealing American-made AI software, which Beijing denies. The Nvidia investigation ups the ante. The company is the face of the AI tech revolution and hurting Nvidia could harm the American company’s ambitions to continue to power AI around the world. Nvidia is also under antitrust scrutiny in the United States, according to Bloomberg. In addition to curbing materials and chips sales, both China and the United States are trying to bolster their own development and manufacturing of microprocessors at home. Through the CHIPS Act, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars into Intel and other companies to boost domestic production of chips and reduce America’s reliance on China and other foreign countries for the technology. Meanwhile, China in May announced plans to set up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund worth $47.5 billion, funded by investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh BEIJING (Reuters) -China said on Monday it has launched an investigation into Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. The statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation announcing the probe did not elaborate on how the U.S. company, known for its artificial intelligence and gaming chips, might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. It said the U.S. chipmaker was also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, under terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. The announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running trade war between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological superiority. Last week, four of China's top industry associations issued a rare and coordinated response saying that Chinese companies should be wary of buying U.S. chips as they were "no longer safe" and should buy locally instead. Nvidia's shares closed 2.5% lower on Monday. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company worked hard to "provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," adding that "we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business". TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Reuters that the probe is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidia’s most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Shortly after Washington's announcement, Beijing banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. Nvidia is one of many companies caught up in U.S.-China friction. U.S. sanctions in 2022 banned shipments of A100 and H100 AI chips to China, leading Nvidia to develop modified versions. These China-specific variants were later restricted under tightened U.S. controls in October 2023, prompting Nvidia to release another set of modified chips for the Chinese market. "It's clear that the Chinese government is trying to react against recent restrictions from the U.S., but their ability to impact the U.S. semiconductor industry continues to decrease over time," O'Donnell said. Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with a more than 90% share before those curbs. However, it faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. China accounted for around 17% of Nvidia's revenue in the year to the end of January, sliding from 26% two years earlier. In 2020, the company won a key approval from China for its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, to the relief of investors who felt Sino-U.S. trade friction could complicate the process. Nvidia and the merged entity were set multiple conditions, requiring them to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" terms. The companies must also provide customers and distributors the opportunity to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The conditions also prohibit forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately. The last time China launched an anti-monopoly probe into a high-profile foreign technology firm was in 2013, when it investigated Qualcomm's local subsidiary for overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm later agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, which was the largest China had ever handed out to a company at the time.

Title: What is high bandwidth memory and why is the US trying to block China’s access to it? | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China. The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It’s a little hard to believe, but 2024 has been a great year for the stock market. Despite all the conflict and uncertainty around the world, the S&P 500 has notched a 26% gain year-to-date, far outstripping its long-term average annual return of around 10%. Read More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Be Aware: Why Skipping a Financial Advisor Could Be Your Biggest Money Mistake Passive investors, who try to replicate the performance of the total market by investing in index funds, have had a great year so far — but there are always some stocks that perform even better than the market average. Most investors who buy individual stocks typically are trying to beat the market and get those outsized returns. When a stock does beat the market, fear of missing out can make it very tempting to invest, but past performance is no guarantee of future success. What has gone up can always come down, so should you buy? Here’s a look at four stocks that have done well in 2024. Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move? YTD gain: 44.17% Better known by its former name, Raytheon Technologies, RTX Corporation is the second largest defense contractor in the United States. As a large conglomerate, it is engaged in a variety of businesses that include aerospace products, aircraft engines and missile systems. Given the amount of military aid that the U.S. is currently sending to several conflict zones, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a defense contractor is doing well. Whether or not that success will continue is unclear. Dr. Peter C. Earle, senior economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, noted that a new presidential administration could have an impact on RTX’s business. “Should the incoming Trump administration follow through on its pledges to force other nations to fend for themselves, the largest publicly traded defense contractors might be poised for a pullback,” Earle said. Verdict: NO Check Out: 3 Undervalued Stocks To Buy Before 2025, According to Experts YTD gain: 83.12% Investors have generally been very well rewarded for holding the stock of retail titan Walmart, and this year has been no exception, as the stock has seen more than double the return of the S&P 500. However, there are some possibly very troubling headwinds that have the potential to make a massive impact on Walmart’s operations. “A cornerstone of the Trump campaign has been tariffs and other forms of trade protectionism. If tariffs of the type which have been discussed are put in place — 60%, 100%, 200%, and so on — retaliatory tariffs would follow. Those could, in turn, devastate companies that rely on imports, [such as] Walmart,” Earle said, citing the fact that Walmart imports many of its goods from Chinese suppliers. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 69.97% Abercrombie & Fitch is a specialty retailer of apparel whose stock has been absolutely surging through 2024. Although down from its mid-year high share price of almost $200, it has still had eye-popping returns for the year so far. Derrick Fung is the CEO of Signals, an investment intelligence platform that tracks consumer spending data to help investors anticipate market movements. His platform’s data indicates a down trend on companies that sell “nice to have” non-durable products — things like higher end cosmetics, apparel and home furnishings. “Our data has been showing a down trend on [ANF] — i.e. we’ve gotten a SELL Signal on all these names in the last 45 days — and the signal has worked on all of them,” Fung said. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 192.98% Chipmaker Nvidia has made a lot of headlines over the last year, as it has skyrocketed to become the second largest company in the world, right behind Apple. Its specialty is in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are highly prized for artificial intelligence applications, and its business has surged along with the wave of hype surrounding generative AI. It’s hard for a business to maintain such a stunning level of growth, so investors may be wondering if it’s time to get off of the rocket. However, for the stock analysts that cover Nvidia, there remains a high degree of enthusiasm for the business. Of the 63 analysts currently making recommendations, 57 of them rate NVDA as a Buy or a Strong Buy. That’s over 90%, and that level of consensus among analysts is often rare.

Title: 5 Stock Buys And Sells From Top Billionaire Investors

Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune of $147 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, more than triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers taken from their most recent SEC filings. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com.

The head of a $210 billion asset management firm has decided to unload a massive pile of assets. Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Time Published: 2024-12-06T22:53:29Z

The shocking killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson this week has shined a light on the security concerns facing corporate leaders and the myriad expenses their companies pay to protect them. Meta (META), for example, shells out a staggering $24.4 million every year on personal security and travel for its CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives. Such costs are appropriate and necessary “in light of the threat landscape,” said the company in its most recent proxy statement. Tesla (TSLA), too, spends millions on security for its CEO Elon Musk, who in recent years has become increasingly concerned about attacks on his wellbeing. The EV maker spent $2.4 million last year to hire a security company for its billionaire leader. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Thompson, who was murdered earlier this week in New York City, headed an insurance subsidiary of UnitedHealth. The parent company didn’t break out any details regarding executive security perks in its 2023 proxy statement, although it noted that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty is required to use corporate aircraft during business travel for security reasons. Security costs across S&P 500 companies have risen substantially in recent years, according to data from Equilar, an executive data compensation research firm. The median value of security expense perks doubled from $47,643 in 2021 to $98,069 by 2023, with the share of companies providing such arrangements for named executive officers increasing by 23.5 percent to 27.5 percent. Here’s a look at what some of the world’s largest tech companies spend on security expenses for their top executives: Meta, the highest S&P 500 spender on executive security perquisites, spent most of its security-related $24.4 million expenses in 2023 on CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He received $9.4 million in costs related to personal security at his residences and during personal travel, in addition to a pre-tax allowance of $14 million to cover additional personal security costs for Zuckerberg and his family. Meta also paid for security for a handful of other of other executives, including $903,139 for chief operating officer Javier Olivan. In 2023, Google (GOOGL)’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) spent almost $6.8 million on personal security services for Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. This makes the tech company the second biggest S&P 500 spender for the year on security perk expenditures, according to Equilar. Amazon (AMZN) spent a grand total of nearly $2.7 million in 2023 on security arrangements for executives including Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Douglas Herrington and Adam Selipsky. Security costs totaled at $1.6 million for Bezos, the company’s founder and executive chair, and $986,164 for CEO Jassy. The company also spent $22,631 on security for Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, and $51,636 on Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nvidia (NVDA) shelled out nearly $2.5 million in fiscal 2024 for its CEO Jensen Huang. These costs included $2.2 million residential security and consultation fees for Huang, in addition to security monitoring services and car and driver services. Apple (AAPL) spent around $820,000 last year on personal security services for its CEO Tim Cook. The company also spent more than $1.6 million on air travel expenses for Cook, a fee that included hourly flight charges, fuel charges, departure fees and landing fees. Due to Apple’s “global profile” and “the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO,” Cook is required to use private aircrafts for all business and personal travel. In December 2023, Tesla paid a security company owned by its CEO Elon Musk to provide services to Musk himself. These expenses totaled $2.4 million in 2023 and around $500,000 through February of this year, according to Tesla’s filings. Musk in July said in a post on his social platform X that two separate people had tried to kill him in the past eight months before they were arrested. In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) put $58,291 towards security-related costs and personal travel expenses for its CEO Satya Nadella. Providing such security services enables top executives “to focus on their duties to Microsoft while reducing security threats, and therefore, mitigate risks to our business,” said the company in a recent filing.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ooredoo is urgently seeking to acquire additional data centers to house Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) latest artificial intelligence chips, as highlighted by its chief executive, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Supported by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, the telecom company is aggressively increasing the capacity of its data centers and using strategic alliances to meet the rising demand for artificial intelligence-driven products. In June Ooredoo signed a major alliance with Nvidia to help this objective, therefore gaining access to the latest-generation graphics processing units. These GPUs will be housed across Ooredoo's 26 data centers spread throughout Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Tunisia, and the Maldives. By means of this alliance, Nvidia marks its first significant artificial intelligence deployment in the MENA area, therefore gaining access to markets from North Africa to South Asia. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ooredoo wants to employ these powerful Nvidia processors to meet the fast growing need for enhanced computing infrastructure, especially for generative artificial intelligence technology. Ooredoo has struggled to create new data centers fast enough to satisfy the growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure notwithstanding the strategic cooperation. The Wall Street Journal claims that right now the corporation is concentrating on acquisitions as a more practical way to handle these problems. Complementing its present 40-megawatt capacity, Ooredoo has pledged $1 billion to increase the capacity of its data center by another 2025 megawatts. With an eye toward giving governments, businesses, and startups throughout the region access to innovative AI resources, Ooredoo intends to almost treble its data center capacity by the end of the decade. Apart from its alliance with Nvidia, Ooredoo's Indonesian division, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, worked with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia in November to introduce Sahabat-AI, an AI language model ecosystem meant to support Indonesian languages. Designed in association with AI Singapore and Tech Mahindra, this project trains and improves AI skills using Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform. Along with its alliances, Ooredoo's strategic emphasis on data center acquisitions shows its dedication to propel digital transformation and innovation all throughout the MENA area. Using Nvidia's cutting-edge technologies and growing data center footprint will help Ooredoo position itself as a major participant in the AI and digital transformation scene and satisfy the fast growing needs for AI infrastructure.

Title: Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/06/sell-nvidia-buy-intel-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of Nvidia, which makes chips used to train artificial intelligence ... [+] technology, takes part in a press conference at the Government Office in Hanoi on December 5, 2024. (Photo by Nam NGUYEN / AFP) (Photo by NAM NGUYEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock surging by over 180% this year, pushing its valuation to close to $3.4 trillion. Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel’s revenues are expected to contract this year. But here’s the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that? Also see a crypto mover that is Up 300% In A Month, XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up. The markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia’s margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn’t be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. We explain below - the ‘why’. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia’s recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY’23 to almost $130 billion in FY’25. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet’s high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models - reducing demand for Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing. Separately, see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Now, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there’s certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share. During the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the “fear of missing out,” without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia’s biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business. While the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock’s Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher. Moreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel’s extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump’s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel’s status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts. Intel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel’s current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel’s improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. While Nvidia has returned outsized gains, in contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY’25 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia’s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company’s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that’s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.
