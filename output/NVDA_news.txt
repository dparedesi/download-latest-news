Title: US stock market retreats after record highs as Powell warns of “highly valued” markets — S&P 500 slips, Nasdaq hit by Nvidia selloff, Micron jumps on strong results

US stock market retreated today after hitting record highs recently, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.53% to around 6,658 and the Nasdaq falling nearly 1% amid a selloff in Nvidia shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dipped 0.19%, closing near 46,293. Nvidia's shares dropped about 2.8% a day after announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which had initially boosted its stock and lifted the market. Micron Technology bucked the trend by jumping on strong fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by robust AI-related demand. Wall Street stepped back from record territory on Tuesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that stocks are “fairly highly valued” and signaled caution on further rate cuts.

Title: MRVL Stock vs. NVIDIA

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology stock recently jumped 12% in a single week, driven by growing optimism about its custom AI accelerators and optical sensitivity chips. This performance raises a key question for investors: how does Marvell now compare to its peer, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)? NVIDIA presents superior revenue growth in key periods, enhanced profitability, and a comparatively lower valuation compared to Marvell Technology, indicating that investing in NVDA may be more advantageous. See how Marvell’s financials compare with its peers, including NVIDIA. MRVL designs and markets analog, mixed-signal, digital, and embedded integrated circuits, providing Ethernet solutions and storage controllers for HDDs and SSDs that support multiple system interfaces. NVDA supplies graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. See further revenue details: See further margin details: However, do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to determine if NVIDIA’s advantage is sustainable or if Marvell Technology still has strategies to deploy (see Buy or Sell MRVL Stock). This is one perspective on evaluating stocks. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Regardless of how appealing the numbers are, stock investing is never without its bumps. There’s risk involved that must be considered. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses and MRVL Dip Buyer Analyses to see how these stocks experienced declines and recoveries in past occurrences. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Stock Price Levels to Watch After Chip Giant's $100 Billion Deal With OpenAI

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground in early trading Tuesday after logging their largest one-day percentage gain since July on news the AI Favorite plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Under the deal, Nvidia will supply OpenAI with its next-generation Vera Rubin platform to help the ChatGPT maker build data centers and other AI infrastructure with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The companies said they anticipate finalizing the details of the partnership in the coming weeks. Nvidia shares were down 2% at around $180 in recent trading after surging nearly 4% on Monday. Through yesterday's close, the stock had gained 37% so far in 2025, handily outpacing broader market returns over the period. Investors have piled into the stock as big tech hyperscalers and sovereign customers invest heavily in the company’s products as they ramp up their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After setting their record high last month, Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle before breaking out from the pattern in Monday’s trading session. The breakout indicates a continuation of the stock’s extended move higher, with increasing volume in recent days signaling conviction from larger market participants. It’s also worth noting that the relative strength index has moved back into bullish territory, confirming strengthening price momentum. Let’s identify two potential bullish price targets to watch on Nvidia’s chart amid the potential for follow-through buying and also point out key support levels worth monitoring during future retracements. Investors can use the measured move technique, also known as the measuring principle, to forecast an initial price target if the stock climbs to a new all-time high. This works by calculating the percentage change between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest section and adding it to the pattern’s top trendline value. For example, in this case, we apply a 16% increase to $179, which projects a target of $207.64, about 13% above Monday’s closing price. To forecast a longer-term price target, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the technique to Nvidia’s chart, we take the stock’s trending move higher from May to August and overlay it from Monday’s breakout point. This forecasts a potential price target of around $255, implying nearly 40% upside from yesterday’s close. This prior rally accelerated after breaking out above the 200-day moving average (MA), potentially providing clues as to how a new trend higher may evolve after Monday’s decisive breakout above the 50-day MA. Investors should initially monitor the $165 level during future pullbacks. This location could provide support near a trendline that links a series of price action on the chart stretching back to early July. Finally, a larger drawdown in the stock opens the door for a retest of lower support around $150. Investors could look for buy-and-hold opportunities in this region near multiple peaks that formed on Nvidia’s chart between November last year and January this year.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after major indexes hit record highs for the third straight session yesterday; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are down slightly in premarket trading after surging following news of the company's $100 billion investment in OpenAI; Micron Technology (MU) is expected to report strong earnings when it releases its financials after markets close today; Boeing (BA) shares are rising after the aircraft manufacturer signed its biggest-ever single order; and the OECD projects U.S. GDP growth will remain resilient this year but will slow in 2026 as tariffs and lower immigration weigh on the economy. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are flat after major market indexes hit record highs for the third consecutive session yesterday. Investors will be following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell today after the central bank last week made its first interest rate cut of the year. Futures tied to the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% in recent trading, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. Gold futures hit another record high this morning, trading at around $3,820 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was up slightly at around $113,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array loans, was at 4.12% recently, down from 4.15% at yesterday's close. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus after the world’s most valuable company said yesterday it would invest up to $100 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Shares of Nvidia surged on the news yesterday, gaining close to 4%, while other chipmakers also moved higher. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in premarket trading. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) is set to release its earnings report after markets close today. Analysts are expecting continued strong sales from the company as the Nvidia-partner has seen strong data center sales from AI-driven demand. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect Micron's adjusted earnings per share to more than double to $2.82, while quarterly revenue is estimated to have risen 43% from the year-ago quarter to $11.12 billion. The chipmaker’s stock hit a new record high last week amid bullish analyst sentiment over the company’s AI exposure. Shares of Micron were up more than 1% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Boeing (BA) are moving higher this morning after the company announced its single largest order in history. Boeing will sell up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, which the company said will support 35,000 jobs. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump said the deal was worth over $8 billion deal and came after he spoke with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev earlier this month. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiations on a large order for Boeing aircraft. Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries shot past analysts' estimates as the plane maker continues its turnaround under a new CEO. Shares of Boeing, which through Monday's close had gained 20% so far this year, were up more than 2% in premarket trading. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of AI investments, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration would lead to slowing growth next year. The OECD said it expects the U.S.'s annual real GDP growth rate to come in at 1.8% in 2025, up from from its previous projection of 1.6%. However, U.S. GDP is projected to grow by just 1.5% next year. "Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States," the Paris-based body said, but also noted that GDP growth is falling from 2024 as "strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher tariff rates and a drop in net immigration."

This was first on deck from last night and Alastair did not disappoint. Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. Oh, Alice X, how times have changed. I remember back in the last century when I loved waking up on Wednesday mornings because that was the day that the NYT’s then food guy, “minimalist” Mark Bittman, printed (yes, PRINT) his easy, fast and delicious recipes. Now it’s Monday, when I wake up, eager, as you say, to ‘take in the day’s latest batch of fresh hell,’ and put on my headphones to listen to Alastair Crooke as I scrub down the kitchen. >Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. This bit? And it it actually reminds me of my favorite story ever. So, it’s about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people and they hate it and they just go bonkers. They hate it and they become obsessed with making him stop. This guy’s got to stop talking. We’ve got to shut this guy up. And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus thinking about what do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking. And there’s always one guy with the bright idea and I could just hear him say, “I’ve got an idea. Why don’t we just kill him? That’ll shut him up. That’ll fix the problem.” It doesn’t work that way. https://youtubetotranscript.com/transcript?v=yUwocghazRc I was amazed he went there.

It’s a remarkable grove in that the highest altitude Sequoias grow there @ 9,000 feet, about 3,000 feet higher than usual, and it also sports around a dozen trees over 300 feet high, not to mention perhaps the oldest Sequoia of all-the Arm Tree, at least 3,000 years old. https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-arm-tree-tour-6212019.html There is one route in via the Paradise Trail, otherwise its all steep off-trail walking to get to the holy grail. In a dozen years of traipsing around in such a fashion with friends, we’ve never met another hiker en route off-trail, so it very much feels like your very own grove of Brobdingnagians, most of which in the higher climes are around 20 feet wide at eye level. The western edge of the grove experienced effects of the KNP Fire in 2021, with the Diamond Tree (19th biggest and 12 feet higher than the Sherman Tree) bearing the brunt of the activity, as flames raced through it’s base and carved a conflagration tunnel about 2 feet wide for 150 feet straight up, with the break-out point where the aged marquise diamond shaped fire scar that gives it the name, is. A mere mortal tree would succumb, but Sequoias can take such a beating and keep on living. Before: https://sequoiaquest.com/diamond.html After: https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-may-2022.html It’s difficult not to feel like a big nothing-a pipsqueak, in their presence. Frankly I was seriously impressed with that Hyperion tree. It’s massive. However Wikipedia says- ‘The exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search. However, in July 2022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing “devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion” caused by visitors. Its base was trampled by the overuse and as a result ferns no longer grow around the tree.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(tree) Coastal Sequoias are basketball players, and Sierra Sequoias are sumo wrestlers… Trees on the coast are in a maze of rainforest, as coastal fog supplies the wherewithal, as opposed to Sierra groves, where in a group effort, they really don’t allow much to grow in their midst and are oh so approachable. I felt as if I was killing something with every step when we were in Redwood NP. When one is in Redwood National Park on California’s north coast, it can be sobering to remember that 95% of these trees were cut down. Cities in the area have names tied to this history. Mill Valley had saw mills and Corte Madera means “cut wood”. From the perspective of the redwood forest, freedom from government regulation was hardly a positive. The Kauri tree in NZ also suffered from being a great hardwood and relatively easy to get to, and 95% of what I’d term a shorter white-bark Sequoia were cut down. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathis_australis No offense but think I prefer basketball to sumo. But all trees are magnificent. Redwoods do have more media presence–that atmospheric scene in Vertigo. If you walk out your back door to the south fork entrance and take the trail to the top of Dennison Ridge you will find a nice little grove at very close to 9000 feet. Very remote and probably seldom visited, an extension of the Garfield grove. Think I’ve been to the area you’re talking about and the Atwell Grove and Garfield Grove are kind of bookends of high altitude Giant Sequoias, one south facing and one north facing. I have only walked to Hockett Meadow once from the South Fork, as somebody has to pay the price for gaining 5,000 vertical feet. My preferred way is to backpack from Mineral King to Hockett and then walk down the Garfield Grove, where experiencing it is more pleasurable as its literally all downhill. Camping spots are at a premium on the Garfield Trail, but we stumbled onto a beauty in the upper grove, a few hundred feet off-trail hidden away, with a large circle of around a dozen boulders of size and surrounded by 20 foot wide Sequoias, with a view across of Homers Nose. It’s a dry camp, with water being about 400 feet up the trail at a creek-so mossies aren’t on ya as much. I saw written on a topo map in the Hockett Meadow ranger’s station ‘Stonehenge’ for the name of the place, and fitting. Here’s a trip report from the last time I saw the King Arthur Tree alive, a year before the Castle Fire burned it up real good. I might have been the last person to see it alive-the 9th largest living thing in the world was not an easy get. https://sequoiaquest.com/garfield-grove-919-222019.html https://sequoiaquest.com/king-arthur.html https://www.ilovetrees.net/king-arthur-dead/ I go through Mineral King to go over the gap into national forest because I don’t have to register at the ranger station and it’s a great way to access the high country by starting at 8000 feet. A great way to get to the grove I am talking about is to head south out of Hockett on the main trail and cut west across summit meadow. Continue down the ridge crest until you reach the grove. There is no trail to speak of after leaving the main trail but there is a trail out of the grove down to the south fork ranger station. Regarding the Chief Investment Officer article in AI-infrastructure investing. There is no way these numbers make any sense at all. And, if they try it will actually crowd out other investing. This is a really bad bet but all parties. Also, it means massive electricity shortages and rising power prices. Just what we need to frustrate consumers and fuel inflation. The shortest path to increasing power generation is combined cycle natural gas. If we are about to enter a period of massive construction of these plants, it seems to me we would be seeing it in the futures curve for natural gas, no? That’s because there is a waiting list of years for gas turbines. https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/052025-us-gas-fired-turbine-wait-times-as-much-as-seven-years-costs-up-sharply Why don’t they get in touch with Iran to acquire those gas turbines? “The Forever-35 Face The face-lift is better than ever, and everybody wants one.

There was some talk of renaming Naval Air Station Lemoore-where the squadron is based, to NAS Lemon, you’d only need to change a few letters. I had trouble reading that a few days ago; the graphic descriptions of how facial surgery is performed made shudder. What a horrific sounding procedure to go through. America is such a hopelessly superficial society. And perpetual facial youth is yours for $100-300K! She’s 32???? I thought she was at least 50 The H1B is framed as indians stealing American jobs, but it could also be framed as India subsidizing the US education system. Though as far as I know, nobody is doing that. Maybe our elites concluded that it’s no longer necessary for India to train American workers, as they believe that AI is going to take over all of the jobs. Really a question of extent to which H1B workers supply missing skills (the subsidize education argument) or replace skilled workers with cheaper alternatives (the stealing jobs argument). My view is that it is mostly but not entirely the latter. The former tend to be highly compensated so at least conceptually a tariff makes some sense, as companies will accept the cost to get truly missing skills, while killing the labor arbitrage of the average worker. The real ‘benefit’ of H1B’s and other guest worker visa’s isn’t necessarily that they are cheaper, but that it creates an indentured servant class that can be treated like garbage. Even in cases H1B’s cost more than an American worker, they might still be preferred by the business class because they get a workforce that’s more compliant and easier to simply discard. Ian Welsh makes that point in his latest piece on the subject: Why Trump’s 100K H-1B Visa Fee Won’t Work & How To Make It Work So, I’ve long had issues with H-1B Visas, and all types of guest-worker visas. Not only do they take jobs from natives, in many cases (but not all), they create a class of workers with limited rights. Bosses don’t just want guest workers because they are cheaper and drive down wages, but because they can be mistreated. No job, no visa, and the time to find a new one is short: sixty days in the case of H1-Bs. Even if the response isn’t to simply offshore the desired talent, the problem remains that the desired (experienced) talent may not be available in USA. Look at the fighting over AI gurus. Overlooked in all of this (I’ve yet to see a single media story mention it) is the fact that companies are still free to sponsor workers for employment-based green cards. The only drawbacks it has compared to H-1B is that it’s more expensive (not any more, with H-1Bs at $100k) and that once it’s approved, it gives the worker the same employment rights as a US citizen or resident. So all the crocodile tears about not being able to get foreign workers are just that. They can still get foreign workers, just not indentured ones. Here’s my anecdata for consideration: At my last two firms (global financial institutions), H1B workers that had attended US institutions – lower or higher education — were few and far between, other than those working in front-office, technically sophisticated areas (e.g., quant trading). That group typically had doctorates in technical fields – physics, math, etc, from the top US institutions (or, rarely, France). Of the H1Bs holding only a foreign undergrad degree a very few were pursuing graduate degrees at local colleges (e.g., Columbia, NYU) while also working. Within my department of 32, of 7 H1B workers only 2 had undergrad degrees from a US college. In 20+ years of hiring for junior staff in the finance world (in a complex but not in highly advanced area), I have generally found the H1B bachelors-holding applicants to be about equal in skills to US citizens with bachelors degrees. There’s a lot of variance in that lot, the brilliant and the morons being about equally distributed. The H1Bs are a bit less clued in to the larger American/Western culture, but I was hiring to get a finance job done, not to discuss the plot line of Emma Bovary. I think there’s a strong argument to be made that the H1B should be restricted to only advanced degree holders, working directly in their degree field – physics PhDs should not be eligible for a visa to work on finance problems, no matter that trading activity could be modeled (and exploited) by applying physics properties. It can be argued that the truly skilled quant personnel can enter under O visas like actors and musicians. I would be happy to see H1-B visas (and really any other “work” visas beyond those needed for very high level collaboration work) to go away altogether. It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force. And BBC literally admits that Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. If these are truly the best, elite people, how is they’re getting paid an average of $94K? Like, for reals? This doesn’t pass the smell test; never has. ‘It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force.’ I think that might have been the plan. Much like China, it can be hard to step back and realize that it’s really the American capitalists and the Indian capitalists that are screwing their collective workers. On balance I think Indian workers probably come out a bit ahead, though. Looking at the supposedly intent of H1B, though, it is telling that the overwhelming majority of H1B holders are from India, followed by China as a distant second; It cannot really be that the world’s best and brightest reside mostly in India in such an overwhelming proportion. The program has been heartily abused as a wage suppression scheme for decades. It’s not complicated. The difference between Indian and Chinese H1-B visa holders is the English language. Indians ALL speak excellent English … better than many native Americans. Slightly different accent so many Americans insist the Indians’ English proficiency is, well … not as good (much less superior) to their own. And this simplification explains Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. Superior skills would generally imply, at least in capitalist America, superior pay. It is not in evidence however. And regardless of even that, there’s been plenty of excellent investigative reporting demonstrating quite clearly how body shops game the H1B system to import workers to replace Americans. This is the overwhelming usage of the system today, as documented extensively. Young Chinese all take 9+ years of English. Many of them speak excellent colloquial English and are even better on reading and writing. I think the difference is that almost all Indian high achievers aspire to leave India for North America, Australia, or the UK. Chinese high achievers are increasingly choosing to stay in China for education and work.

Union Pacific – Norfolk Southern merger UP-NS merger ‘sounds good to me,’ Trump says Train magazine Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. STB Criteria is serve the Public interest and enhance competition, huh? Looks like a rubber stamp to me. Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. Trains Matthew K. Rose, who retired as BNSF Railway’s executive chairman in 2019, says the UP-NS merger would be a train wreck for President Donald Trump’s reindustrialization efforts … Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads have proposed a merger — what could possibly be wrong with a transcontinental railroad? First, there exists no financial crisis in the rail industry, like that which drove the significant consolidation in the freight rail industry over the last 30 years. The proposed merger is driven by management and a micro-minority of activist stockholders, not for the benefit of shippers, employees, or even most investors. Second, risk of merger integration and ongoing operational failures of a nationwide rail network is significant. Transcontinental railroads, given their size, are too big to run but not too big to fail. Finally, the merger puts industrial and commodity shippers at a disadvantage — the very U.S. industries that President Donald Trump is seeking to promote. Let me explain… Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) has been asset stripping for 15 years now. Employment down 33%, ripped up yards and trackage. Freight volumes have flat-lined since mid 2000s, while trucking is up 30% Railroads have a 40% margin. Wall Street and executives compensated with stock are the ONLY beneficiaries of consolidation. Customers, the public and environment are the lovers. The only positive is consolidation makes nationalization easier in the future. Railroads should be a public asset and not a plaything for billionaires. Reading Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Revolution right now which is written from a Marxist viewpoint. Apparently the US was one if the very few Western countries whose railroads were not nationalized from the get-go. The US was nationalized by the railroads Childhood plastic exposure could be fueling obesity, infertility, and asthma Maybe autism? Psychopathic behavior?

Was in Hong Kong for a coin show when Ike rolled into town, and what a performance. I was on the 17th floor of the Holiday Inn in Kowloon, part of me wanted to watch the proceedings from a window, and another part of me wanted to lay in the bathtub sans water, and lock the bathroom door-just in case. The latter strategy won out. It felt like a continual 4.1 earthquake for an hour, quite unsettling. The next day, junks were 100 yards inland along with other boatalities scattered to and fro, bamboo which was used rather exclusively for scaffolding, was shredded similar to shredded wheat, and bamboo is no shrinking violet. I’ll take earthquakes instead… I guess that when you are used to earthquakes that only last a few seconds, that it would be extremely unnerving being in a swaying tower for over an hour. Reading up on Typhoon Ike, it was a monster- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ike Some earthquakes last over a minute, but what makes them so long is how time slooowws down the more you while in your chair dances around the floor. Those seconds feel like minutes and for those few quakes that do last minutes, I imagine that they do feel like they last hours. Also, if you’re in a serious quake zone (e.g. Sumatra) the thought that gets me is “this is minor right now, but could get really destructive”. Never felt so small. When I lived in Banda Aceh there are noticeable earthquakes every few days. After a while of this our brains kept “feeling” non-existent quakes. Ended up keeping a glass of water on the table so we could check for ripples. No fan of wind, but would take it over quakes. A glass of water on a table can give a warning about other things as well- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25udaa-Wn4E When those little orange tiger cubs grow up will they always play nice with their human hosts and handlers?

NATO Ramps Up for War with Russia” ‘…the NATO members genuinely believe that they enjoy military superiority over Russia and are proposing a range of crazed responses to alleged Russian provocations, such as shooting down Russian combat aircraft and closing the Baltic Sea to Russian maritime traffic.’ These are known as acts of war and I doubt even Trump will intervene if some of these eastern NATO members try a stunt like this. I keep on getting the impression that these countries are saying stupid stuff like this because they are absolutely convinced that Trump will ride to their rescue, even if it means triggering WW3. Since the Pentagon recently announced that they are pulling weaponry and resources out of the Baltic States, that is not a bet that I would take. > Sinclair preempts Jimmy Kimmel Live! after ABC’s decision to reinstate.

Wolfgang Munchau: The war cheerleaders need to go back to the mindset I had in the 1980’s. War in central Europe was (and is) a tripwire for nuclear war! Recall of the horrors of WW II was gone in my view. Vietnam and the limits of US power were in play! Ground Launched Cruise Missiles and Pershings (nuclear tipped all) in Europe. The war cheerleaders need to recognize the limits of US power to project against a first world power within its geography. They also need to recognize their own limits. The fact that sanctions were wrong was obvious: long term trade benefits both sides. G7 is slowing in part because they shot themselves in the feet with sanctions. Anyone with eyes and Econ 101 would see! They should all pull up Nena’s “99 Red Balloons” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpu5a0Bl8eY&list=RDFpu5a0Bl8eY&start_radio=1 Those cheerleaders could also try a little harder to explain what victory in a NATO-Russia conflict looks like to them in both the nuclear and nonnuclear cases. Anyone using the word “Putin” in the answer should explain how Russian security interests change when he’s gone or else own up that they really want something like the prostrate Yeltsin client state selling everything they can for pennies on the dollar. Extreme economic and political instability in Russia is a desirable strategic goal? You mentioned the sanctions. If the US top goal for Project Ukraine was to gather its European vassals back, domineer them, extract tribute, and sever their relations with the East then so far it looks like it has worked. Breaking up Russia is unspoken U.S./UK/Berlin/Brussels goal. Not explicitly written in print media – (because they all know to officially demand Russia´s break-up would be against international law which by design only Russians are capable of violating) – but tacitly understood by editors and readers and politicians alike. One of those lovely Bourdieu-esque cultural demoninators among elites. It is contradictory that in this article, Munchau, while correctly identifying the warmongers still buys their propaganda and the “unacceptable aggresions” by Russia and tries “not to underpin the security threat posed by Vladimir Putin”. This security threat is, in it’s entirety, a creation of the CW and expanded even more by the European warmongers themselves. It is real because it exists in the minds of those who so rabidly want war with Russia but it would dissipate as soon as the sanctions-obsessed warmongers were substituted by more rational actors with a will to restore relationships instead. Does he try, with this contradiction, not to be sidelined completely by the very same propagandist warmongers he is criticising? If so I think it is illusory for Munchau to believe that he can stand in some kind of middle way. He must be either with them in every sense or totally against them because the warmongers themselves will demand it. I think this explains what he writes his last phrase: “They leave me in no doubt that there is substantial support for a glorious war, just as there was over 100 years ago” and omits the corollary “and this support might end with the same tragic consequences”. Munchau tries, somehow cowardly, not to compromise too much. Regarding the Dr. Goebbels, article from 1938, (A nice example of cancel culture rom the past.) the kind doctor’s rhetoric sounds familiar. brazen, impertinent, arrogant and tactless… society rabble that followed them with thundering applause—parasitic scum, inhabiting our luxury streets, that seems to have only the task of proving with how little brains people can get along and even acquire money and prominence As does this observation from the author, What amused the public most, however, and presumably roiled the National Socialist authorities most—although Dr. Goebbels does not mention it—is that they deftly, but unmistakably, caricatured some gestures, poses and physical characteristics of National Socialist leaders—sometimes with bon mots that made the rounds of the country. Terrorist bon mots! “‘We’ve given up on Israel’: Disillusioned with Netanyahu and the war in Gaza, Israelis are fleeing” Maybe this lot is smarter than I figured. That sooner or later Netanyahu would start attacking those on the left as outcasts in order to secure his own position. Just the other day in the US we saw the hard right declare a virtual war against leftists. So it may be only a matter of time til Netanyahu does the same in Israel. > “‘We’ve given up on Israel’: Disillusioned with Netanyahu and the war in Gaza, Israelis are fleeing” > Just the other day in the US we saw the hard right declare a virtual war against leftists.

As a cynical American conditioned to listen for war drums, financial stabilization is not my first thought when I see a US official use that line in reference to international affairs. Are we sure this isn’t Act II of a flanking maneuver on the southern cone as the US war machine repositions for Monroe Doctrine 2.0? Argentina is probably too far to be of any assistance with the war on Venezuela but lots of water and minerals in Argentina. I believe that many people are attending or watching memorials for Kirk with real feeling, but spontaneous and impromptu are not accurate. The well-funded bots and monied efforts on all the socials (including YouTube) and throughout the internet, never mind FOX news and bots in place to create conflict, did so much to foment the mood, along with the White House. (Although I suspect Trump is pretty steamed about now with all the admiration for Kirk.) It’s exhausting. For a while there the Kirk-bot posts outpaced “thank you, RFK, Jr!” Bots.

This week the Moon of Alabama blog will, hopefully, move onto a new blogging system and a new hosting service. I have tried to prepare for the move to be as smooth as possible. However – experience says that any such move hardly ever happens without severe hick-ups. This will take all the time I have and, until the move is done, there will be few if any new posts. At some point I will close the comments on the old side and open them on the new one. I will then change the name-server entries to direct all requests for moonofalabama.org to the new physical server. This changeover will take some time to proliferate throughout the distributed global Domain Name Service (DNS). If you are experiencing problems reaching Moon of Alabama just wait a while, maybe even a day, and try again. Since Typepad announced its close down its service has deteriorated. Some blog functions have stopped working and the help desk has become unresponsive. It may therefore take some time to put the complete archives onto the new server. The last two or three weeks of posts and comments will, at first, likely be missing. I will try to correct that as soon as possible but will depend on Typepad to be able to do this.

But I’m not sure I’d call Carney either a fool or a Deep State operative. When your Prime Minister is the former Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, it tells me that elites don’t even have to pretend any more that you are a “democracy” of all the people. It’s as if billionaires in the US just started running for elective office directly rather than funding “regular” candidates secretly… oh wait. Oligarchs don’t have to pretend we have a democracy anymore. Nor do they have to pretend that their words have any relation to facts. It’s all just for show these days. Trudeau gets replaced by this guy. Biden gets replaced by Trump. Nothing fundamentally changes.

(or main page has a link in the ‘trending’ column). Thank you! Those pumpkins are a great vegetable. Terrible waste of good food. I had to address the corn syrup vs sugar story. I quit drinking all sodas over 10 years ago due to corn syrup. I realize sugar isn’t good either, but in general avoid all products containing corn syrup. I do not eat anything with corn syrup in the product, I found it in campbells tomato soup and Italian sausage. I found it in all sorts of products and just classify it as processed food. I have found many alternatives and try to eat as organic as possible. If I do choose a soft drink, I try to stick to diet but wonder if sugar might still be a better choice than whatever chemical compound the diet soda might have in it. So all the hysteria relative to corn syrup was just nonsense? Really? Yes. With sodas, the colorings are at least as bad as the sugars. Aspartame has more complaints than any other food additive approved by the FDA by a huge margin, yet oddly RFK, Jr. is not interested in that.

We switched to flavored carbonated water and like it pretty well. “I Took Bernie Into Deep Trump Country. Can He Win Them Over?” Bernie won nearly every county in Upstate NY that went for Trump. The reason why in retrospect at latest Bernie gotta seriously ask himself why he did not risk a rift in the DNC back in 2016 and 2020. I am not pink-glassed re: Bernie (in Germany he would have been a Merkel-man). But by comparison… Because he needed ballot access. The rules in many states for new parties are insanely restrictive. I understand the reason why he did not run third party, as the chances of a third-party candidate ever being successful are impossible the way that the ballot laws are intentionally-written. However, a lot of people are very bitter (Myself included) over the fact that he did not take Biden to task as he and the rest of the Democratic Party so richly deserved and instead groveled before the very establishment that was blatantly trying to cheat him and as a result, we got stuck with his “friend” Joe Biden. At the very least, he could openly point out how dishonest the leadership of the DNC is and how they are just as much of an obstacle to taking on the plutocratic oligarchy as the Republicans are. I understand that he was afraid of a Trump victory at the time, so he tried to foster “party unity” among the Democratic Party. He still got a proverbial kick in the teeth from them after doing so. The problem is that Sanders does not seem to realize that the Democratic Party as a whole, particularly the Clintonite wing is never going to forgive him no matter what he does for daring to challenge Hillary’s claim to the throne in 2016, so there is no point in trying to appease members of the Democratic nomenklatura who are going to hate him no matter what he does. He should have given them no quarter, because they certainly did not give him any. Only after you are victorious should you consider extending the proverbial olive branch. Indeed. I give him a pass for 2016 – he did make a pledge ahead of time to support the eventual nominee, and he kept it even after he got screwed. That shows integrity. But given that, when they stuck the knife in again in 2020, he should have gone scorched earth. Yeah. The part that got me was barely acknowledging the multiple efforts made to successfully sabotage both his campaigns. I get ‘16 for the same. He made a pledge, kept his word.

Shutdown theater continues: Trump says no meeting with top Democrats on shutdown ‘could possibly be productive’ President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to cancel a planned meeting this week with the two top Democrats in Congress, just days before the federal government is set to shut down. Trump had been scheduled to meet with Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries sometime this week, CNBC and other news outlets reported. “After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. This year is pretty lit. Meanwhile on Priced out of traditional housing, more Americans are living in RVs Out here, we have a ton of RVs, but these seem to be much more affluent or at least reasonably well off RV owners.

Theater, indeed … of the Japanese “Kabuki” variety. Only the lonely Thomas Massie had the integrity to point out that a CR simply restores the funding to USAID and other agencies that Musk allegedly “wood chippered” back to Biden-era levels. So, should a CR pass, expect a massive hiring spree at NGO’s and NGO adjacents, such as Business Insider, Forbes, and Politico (beneficiaries of USAID largesse.) Gotta crank out those Goebbels-style propaganda pieces … they won’t write themselves! Ukraine is winning, Gaza isn’t genocide, etc. Or maybe they will write themselves, thanks to AI. Only a fool would ever think that the GOP is in favor of spending cuts. The end result will be a few days of shutdown theater, followed by a CR and more spending than last year, as always. I assume this is all about dollar shorts and gold / silver puts. Is everything broken? 1) I ordered two identical ceiling fans from an online website. They shipped in two different packages. The first one arrived. The second one didn’t. I checked the tracking website and saw that the second package was stuck in a distribution center in Texas. I called the shipping company and they tried to trace the package. A couple of days later I received an email that the package was lost and I needed to contact the vendor. The vendor said they would ship a replacement. I specifically told the vendor that I had ordered two, received one, and it was just the one that was missing. I got an email from the vendor that the replacement was ordered, but I noticed that the vendor ordered two fans. I called the vendor and explained that I had already received one. I was told they would try to stop one from shipping, but it was probably too late. They verified that, yes, I had informed them that I only needed one replacement. I ended up getting two replacement fans from the vendor. Then a couple of days later, the shipper evidently found the “lost” package and sent it. So, I ended up with four ceiling fans. I called the vendor and they said I could ship them back if I wanted to and they would email prepaid shipping label. I never received the shipping label. I guess I will donate them to Habitat for Humanity. 2) I ordered two different “Wicked” t shirts for a family member who is a “Wicked” fan. They were sent in two different packages. The first one was what i ordered, the second one was a Harry Potter t shirt with no tags — it looked like it had been a return. I called the vendor and I was told a replacement would be sent. I specifically told them which one I had received and which one needed to be replaced. I got the shipment and ended up receiving the t shirt I already had. 3) I ordered a pair of jeans from an online retailer. The manufacturer had two labels with a smaller size than what I ordered. However, the retailer puts its own sticker on the item that indicated a different (right) size. So I ended up with the smaller (wrong) size. I give up,. Yes Amazon? No. If you itemize your deductions, be sure to also take the deduction for your fan donation :-) Are stolen items deductible? I believe he said they never sent the return UPS stickers so they are abandon items which he happens to possess. I would expect these to be deductible as he becomes the default owner. He did his diligence in trying to return them. Yup. everything is broken. Similar thing happened with a buddy, but with a large flatscreen TV. First shipment was delayed and they eventually wound up with two and the company they bought it from didn’t want the 2nd one back. This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product. “This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product.” I was thinking the same thing. The fan vendor told me I could just keep the two extra fans. Since I had no need for two more fans and didn’t want the hassle of selling them, I thought I would just try to return them. The two extra fans were over $300 (total, not apiece). I think some of these companies run a business with low cost of goods and higher costs for people and shipping and storage. Somehow it’s cheaper for them to abandon physical goods than to bring them back, clean them up and repackage them. We’ve had a few experiences like this where when we received lightly damaged goods (dented metal) they just sent us a new one without asking for a return of the damaged one. Quality control on soda has gone down; I’ve had more damaged or even leaking cans than I’ve ever had before, although the number I can count on a single hand.

Secret Service dismantles telecom threat around UN capable of crippling cell service in NYC | CNBC Forensic analysis is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries — used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point. About a decade ago I was doing a lot of regular business travel to NYC and noticed an immediate degradion in my cell service especially with images. It was so bad I had a recurring joke with my friends that NYPD had a geofence around Manhattan to slurp up racy pictures and texts and that was why my messages would take multiple retries to send. Wonder how long this install has been in place? So nation state actors, but they aren’t blaming Russia?!!!?? Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? I wonder why authorities aren’t offering any suggestions here, normally they are very quick to assign blame whether the facts are there or not. This reminds of that story about the mysterious drones over NJ that we never got an answer to – we probably won’t here either. Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? Lol yeah also my first thought. So when they got to the part about cartels it sounded very unlikely. But I like another commenter’s suggestion down thread that it could have been used for comment swarming/consent manufacturing “China Rare Earths Issue Remains Unresolved, US Lawmaker Says” Bit unsporting of the Chinese to refuse to sell refined earths to ultimately the Pentagon so that they can be used to build weaponry to be eventually used against China. The whole thing is ironic as there is an outbreak of peace in the Pacific right now simply because at the moment the US does not have the wherewithal to militarily confront China. China would be wise to keep this as a trump card (no pun intended.) For example: “Oh, so you say you want us to stop buying Russian oil … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” “Oh, so you say you will slap tariffs on us if we don’t buy Boeing … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” Perhaps Bessent and Lutnick could something something blockchain the rare earths? StableGallium? re: Germany’s death wish – not fit for war, but addicted to war I am known to be part of that faction that doubts any of the war threats by EU are serious. Hadn´t RU attacked no PR office in Berlin and Brussels could have come up with a more brilliant strategy to rule and extort. For them this was gold. Again: Why put all this to danger after it was given to them on a silver plate? Allegedly so far numbers of those joining Bundeswehr have risen by 15%. After 4 years of this? That´s not much. Especially if you consider how little that is in absolute seize. Also keep in mind that Germany already had a huge standing army. So nothing of this is new. Even, to my knowledge, the planned Tomahawks 2026 are not new and thus not faster than what we had here before (the system is 40 years old). What is faster is the Russian response and in case those Dark Eagles do fly one day which they do not on a reliable scale yet. I am not trying to downplay. But I firmly believe that crunching serious economic and military numbers and challenge the war parties that would open up a revealing debate in the sense of: “Mr. Merz, do you really want war with RU? If so, then you have to do this and this and this and turn Germany into the Fourth Reich. Do what the Nazis did. And then you loose either the planet (because nobody will survive WWIII) or you loose the country´s wealth for building a useless military.” And quickly the emperor would loose his clothes. But the peace movement for lack of competence shies away. And thus unwillingly protects the status quo and its parties. It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind and it’s now been discarded as they reach the starting post for third time unlucky. As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. I think that this is one of the most important stories posted above: EU and German government sanction German journalist for critical tweets about Chancellor Merz. It gives us the real taste of the Fourth Reich. Being generous, you are painting with quite the broad brush here. >It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind This doesn’t fit with my experience living in Germany and knowing many Germans. It anything, they are much more aware of the dangers of fascism. > As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. As a Brit, I am consistently ashamed at the magnitude of British war crimes and colonial and post-colonial evil. I am ashamed of what we have done in recent years to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya etc etc. We Brits have much blood on our hands, and IMO are in no position to lecture the Germans. Not to mention Mr Starmer’s continuing drift into authoritarianism. The Krauts may be aware of fascism because liberal democracy has failed and the country is getting bsck to normal, the sheep meekly following German “leaders” authoritarian Nazi flecked anti-slav leaders in Berlin and Brussels with Eastern ambitions. Now they want to stretch the Fourth Reich to Russia to steal its resources. Just business as usual. Fortunately, for the rest of us, they lack the strategic genius which gave Hitler his initial victories in Western Europe and Poland, but they’ve inherited his dumbest decision by taking on Russia at a game the Russians now plays better than any other country. As a Brit, I’m fully aware that the Brits are prepared to do a lot of dirty jobs and we did get a lot of blood on our hands defending British interests. Unfortunately, we now have leaders who seem to prefer folliowing the Krautberg agenda in the Ukraine and Israel but, hopefully, things might improve when the Labour party dumps the bootlicking Der Starmer and then proceeds to rip itself apart giving Reform and Your Party a chance to replace deadbeat Labour and the clapped out Tories and seize the opportunities offered by sterling and concentrate on developing trade relations with Russia and the other BRICS countries. Oooh my better half is a huge Sauerkraut fan. Better I keep this post secret ;-) OT p.s. on 1940 – Currently am reading military history “Blitzkrieg-Legende, Der Westfeldzug 1940” by Karl-Heinz Frieser. I recommend it. Although Frieser claims – in a real side show in this case – that Halder did an excellent job in portraying the Wehrmacht (however the Western campaign) as head of the Operational History German Section, which is however known to have manipulated history re: USSR. But Frieser does give interesting and detailed insight into how Manstein and that Sichelschnitt attack plan came together against Halder, later due to Halder, and it was risky, i.e. it could have failed. As to “genius” the jury is still out to whether or not the French on a longterm planning level did sabotage their own capabilities in the sense that most parties of the formative French elites undermined the 3rd Republic and yearned for a subordination under German-ruled EU. The fact that French air forces, army and even tanks were larger in numbers at least than German, the fact that at least in PR terms France was intended to keep peace in Europe with the largest European Armed Forces still I cannot entirely discount as pure fantasy. How can you have de Gaulle suggesting tank tactics and yet have a French subterranean HQ but no phone (Gamelin instead driving to other generals by car wasting 2 hours, sometimes 2 days.) Long story short, Blitzkrieg was as much “Blitz” as the enemy let it to be. Also – this is from US scholarship – French secret intelligence knew darn well what the Germans were up to in terms of going to war. It´s absurd to assume that they were surprised. So by a rough look none of this collapse adds together… I was thinking of the strategic value of Pervitin use by German forces invading Poland in 1939 and, in particular, by Panzer crews during the invasion of France and the Low Countries in 1940, as recounted in Ohler’s ‘Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich’. The trouble is that Pervitin use made sense when speed and alertness were key factors by seeming to effectively amplify forces in a short campaign but much less so in a drawn out slogging match with the USSR when issuing winter uniforms would have been of greater benefit. Why revert to the bigotry of former times? “Krauts” ? What disparaging racial epithet applies to you? To me? Are those epithets what we really are? Is that what you think is using your head? Maybe bertl is in need of a Jeeves… My British and Italian ancestors fought against the Germans in both world wars (the “Wop” slain at Ortona, the “Mick” made deaf in a training accident on Salisbury Plain, the “Limey” shell-shocked at Third Ypres.) They thought they were fighting for a world in which people might not be judged for what they were born as. But I suppose you’d have to be some sort of stupid Canuck to believe that, eh? Really, though, it’s not an illusion. We’re all just people: the Hun, us, everybody. So let’s cut out the crap. It’s less a disparaging racial epiphet and more a disparaging linguistic epiphet about a people drawn together by a common language. I can’t even begin to tell you what I think of the English, but we Scots are intelligent, witty, charming, great at doing our English overlord’s military dirty work, and handsome and virile and we grow great beards as well. ‘Douglas Macgregor @DougAMacgregor THREAD: The Strategic Mutual Defense Pact (SMDP) signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan on September 17th signals a seismic shift in global power dynamics. Between 2020 and 2024, more than 60 percent of China’s arms exports went to nuclear-armed Pakistan. China maintains tacit support for this alliance through its deep partnership with Pakistan while simultaneously arming Iran with critical military components.’ Looks like China is really inserting itself in the Middle east and the US/NATO cannot stop them. I think the thing that is really going to push this into overdrive is how the US not only let Israel attack Qatar but shut down their air defenses to enable it. And we will see a lot more Chinese weaponry in this region too like is happening in Iran. For the countries in the Middle east, there is a new sheriff in town.

Because how do you manage to devalue that. Except of course “Trump is a Putin stooge” etc. But in general nukes are simply nukes. No discussing that away. And you really have to stretch to make less nukes look bad. From the “Israel warns the EU” post: So, Israel has dismissed a recent recognition of a Palestinian state by several Western countries as mere political theatre. How can this move be more than a symbolic gesture and really translate into concrete actions that advances the peace process? Seriously? The “peace process” meme is still floating around out there? How is the peace process doing these days, anyway? Seems a bit down at the heels! Will the media still be asking about it when every Palestinian has been murdered and every Israeli has fled to the Ukraine or some other new homeland? I suppose there are different varieties of peace. “where they make a desert, they call it peace” Good news, department: The rapture is scheduled for today/tomorrow: https://www.statesman.com/news/article/rapture-bible-why-christians-23-tomorrow-pastor-21060773.php So, we can expect to see some Charlie Kirk supporters disappearing?

Police violence of this sort has been around in G7and G8 countries for decades. German police in the 1980s in fact had to change their tactics (to later ramp up their violence) because camera showed too much blood during public protests and that hurt government policies. This was all happening around anti-NPP protests. With protesters fighting cops. Being attacked from helicopters. Climbing fences. And getting beaten up. Remember the summer of Paris 1967? Or Berlin 1968? Or the death of Carlo Giuliani during the Genoa protest in the summer of 2001? I did some little reporting about Arab students in Germany in the wake of the post 9/11 Patriot Act frenzy in 2002/03. Those students lost their visa, lost their university spots, lost their jobs. They were subject to police surveillance, and general racist hysteria. I am not sure today´s left sincerely remembers the atmosphere of those years towards Muslims in general. It was ghastly. A public hysteria palpable when you walked the cities. I am having issues if Chris Hedges makes his drastic comparisons while he talks about his accompanying KLA forces. Or comparing Ukraine War with Iraq War before the fact, or talking about his dreadful experience in Latin America while making assumptions about today´s sit. I am not sure on the other hand. Indeed I am not an activist. And obviously the state lashes out against those who do push the limits. After all why fear those who do not question authority? So what is above video and what are above images about others doing videos proof of? I don´t know. But as long this “exchange” and its documentation is media reality I will keep reminding that by March 1933 – 2 months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor and at the same time the rigged 1933 elections took place – which btw still did not give NSDAP a two-third majority – NSDAP 44% vs. opposition of SPD/KPD/Zentrum 44+% – 100k people were in concentration camps subject to torture and killing, worse than Guantanamo. All this just 6 months after major newspapers in Germany had been rejoicing about the end of the NSDAP which had lost many votes in the 1932 elections and was bankrupt. p.s. when did either Taibbi, Hedges or any other knowing commentator in the US – or anyone I take seriously enough to ponder over what they are writing – last mention the problem of fascism in conjunction with Ukraine??? So we look at the “authoritarian turn” at home – which is all fine and dandy – but what about e.g. this quip from last year´s NYT, Nov. 21st? “(…)Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.(…)” https://archive.is/4G56L Azov dangling nukes before our cameras? Coooool. I can literally see how Kirn, here out of his depths in contrast to his excellent insight on cultural phenomena and entertainment life, would mutter some “why not?” argument just because it fancies “something daunting.” (This is provocative of course, since I am aware Kirn is bitterly opposed to WWIII provocation. But to point out the momentary contradictions inherent in ideology posing as “opinioned society”.) I have repeatedly said that Tylenol should not be sold OTC due to liver toxicity risk Why is this kind of reasoning so rare? The acetaminophen – autism link certainly doesn’t seem strong but that doesn’t mean it’s not a dangerous drug and shouldn’t be controlled more carefully. The binary approach to just about everything in our human culture is depressing. As to the Tylenol-autism link see: Tylenol and Autism from Science Based Medicine. Spoiler alert, current scientific consensus is that there is none. Science Based Medicine also has an article regarding the efficacy of prenatal vitamins in reducing the risk of autism, as well as other aspects of the condition: Autism and Prenatal Vitamins. This is but one of many SBM articles on the topic. I do take acetaminophen sparingly, for the reasons cited by Yves, because I cannot tolerate aspirin and other anti-inflammatories. My last purchase of Tylenol consisted of bright red, very sweet tablets which seem perfectly designed for children to accidentally poison themselves. From this morning, Cache of Devices Capable of Crashing Cell Network Is Found Near U.N., NYT, archived. The lede, The Secret Service discovered more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers, which could disable cellular towers or be used to conduct surveillance. The tech gear is above my pay grade, but might this be a narrative construction center with a hundred thousand voices? Initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards has identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as links to criminals already known to U.S. law enforcement officials, including cartel members, Secret Service officials told reporters on Monday Curious. I don’t know what to make of this story. What if it turns out to be an off-the-books operation by the NSA or some other domestic spook operation? > NSA or some other domestic spook operation It smells more like manufacturing consent for action against a nation with ‘cartels’. If domestic, why announce it? Unless it’s an intra-spookdom fight. Can’t be Israel, as zero chance the SS exposes Bibi machinations. Whichever, it feels like another shoe needs to drop before it makes sense. In the past, a plucky little country in the Middle East embedded themselves in US telecom for some reason. I’m always amazed by the important links that no one seems to be interested in talking about here in the current commentariat… As to the upcoming decline in imports due to tariffs, this is how bad they’re expecting it to get: September will likely mark the beginning of more pronounced declines. In a September 17 presentation, the Port of Los Angeles director stated they expected inbound volume to drop 10% compared to the same month last year. Container bookings data supports this outlook, with bookings from China to the U.S. down 26% in the first week of September compared to the same period last year. Of course a shortages create their own inflation, so I think there’s going to be a very bleak Christmas this year. At least on the West Coast, my understanding is that it takes a couple more months for this situation to be reflected on the East Coast. As Yves alluded to, I’m hoping to see price drops locally. But given that we have a 22% import tax, that’s going to effect our government coffers as well. Just speaking for myself, I have become numbed by all the flip-flopping, TACO Tuesdays, and general can-kicking by the administration. How many of these tariffs are real, and how many “carve-outs” are there? I know that some of them are real, as the revenue coming in cannot be faked (well, let’s hope not.) I thought we’d be seeing riots at the local Home Depot over the last battery-powered leaf blower by Bastille Day. data center power usage I am more confused. All the media keeps saying data centers are driving up electrical prices. All the data I can find says about 25 gw of actual new electrical data center usage. And up to 80 gw by 2030 that appears to be the most commonly agreed on going forward. The US actual capacity is 1250 GW, means 2% is driving all this? Of which most is concentrated in just a few small areas? I think it’s all sloppy reporting, and the reality is that raw energy prices are going up, inflation, and tariffs for everything else. I have no love of DC or AI, but it’s not ringing true they are the reason for the large increases across the country. Gail Tverberg takes the perspective that upfront costs and amortization conflict with low demand, and income inequality is a major driver of the disparity. See the comment on turbines by windall above. It could be pricing in the future costs. Or grifting… She and Tainter are scheduled to do keynote speeches at a conference Oct 25. They both share the perspective of decreasing returns on complexity in regressing systems. Fun stuff. A follow-up: John Robb: U.S. AI data center demand is forecast to reach 123GW by 2035 (vs. just 4GW in 2024). links to: > OpenAI and NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10 Gigawatts of NVIDIA Systems {note the phrase ‘gold-rush’ in the url} Even 123GW could be a real problem in the material world. Simple copper shortages are one node of the hydrakrisis. But with Intel.gov * Nvidia stake in Intel * Nvidia is the fulcrum of the inverted pyramid supporting the stock market, it sure looks like a national security socialization program. Where does grift end and borgenstat begin? I’ll look to what Stoller has to say on this. Busting trust, indeed. Adam Tooze, from Wednesday’s Links: > In practical terms the most important tension may be over electric power. Trump’s pivot against renewables makes no sense from a business or tech point of view. But rather than fundamentally obstructing the AI push its most likely impact is to raise costs at the margin. Don’t bet on the hyperscalers allowing the lack of windmills to get in their way. Picasso or Bitcoin? How art’s status is changing among the super-rich The Art Newspaper ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The name-brand art bubble has been something to behold and by far the best performing of all markets bubbly. To pick an example, Paul Cézanne’s ‘Portrait of Madame Cézanne’ fetched $34,500 in 1946, and last sold for $7.4 million this year. Nexstar says it will pre-empt Kimmel but maybe not forever. So this will black out the show for 1/4 of the country. Sinclair also says their block being negotiated. https://deadline.com/2025/09/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-preemption-1236553268/ https://archive.is/o8Rky#selection-447.0-447.74 Hamburger Helper nutritional values: https://www.nutritionix.com/food/hamburger-helper You don’t say? Fed Chief Powell says stock prices appear ‘fairly highly valued’ Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values. “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell probably knows how history treated Irving Fisher after Fisher’s “stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau” quote in Oct 1929 https://www.nytimes.com/1929/10/16/archives/fisher-sees-stocks-permanently-high-yale-economist-tells-purchasing.html Anathema – https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/breaking-news/article/mlb-announces-automated-ball-strike-system-challenges-for-2026-season-180216779.html I won’t get into all the reasons why this is just wrong, wrong, wrong (check the definition of the strike zone in the MLB rule book for starters), but I did want to highlight this bit – “Rejoice, MLB fans, robot umpires are almost here … well, kind of.” The fact that this author thinks real fans should rejoice about robots taking over says a lot. Clearly a lot of people would rather live in the Matrix than actually deal with reality. And clearly a lot of people are really stupid if they believe a robot designed by humans is going to be infallible. But as we’ve seen with polls about “AI”, the less people know about how it works, the more they trust its results. And I’m already fantasizing about MLB players going ‘office space’ on robot umpires. From last night, heh heh, Moldova’s election faces AI-driven disinformation from Russia, AP. That’s quite a headline. I’m beginning to understand why every oligarch needs a data center. Unsurprisingly, lots of “Russia, Russia, Russia!” with the usual “attributed” and “alleged”, Tidbits, Moldovan authorities have long warned that Russia is conducting a hybrid war — meddling in elections, disinformation campaigns, illicitly funding pro-Russian parties — to try to derail the country’s path toward EU membership. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova. Spoof websites impersonate legitimate Western media and pay “engagement farms” in Africa, while AI bots are deployed to flood comment sections deriding PAS and the EU. The obligatory clampdown, Police on Monday arrested 74 people in 250 raids as part of an investigation into an alleged Russia-backed plan to incite mass riots and destabilize the country. Anschluss in plain sight for Moldova. Brown shirt organisations springing up wherever you look. Just waiting for the uniformed groups marching around cities to intimidate everyone not sharing their views, although the marching seems to done on digital media nowadays. You don’t have to be a historian to see what is coming, plan accordingly. Trade being 60% of world GDP nowadays the economic dislocations about to occur will be off the charts. I take offense with the word Anschluss describing a potential reunification of R of Moldova with Romania. It would be the third one and hopefully luckyer. There are twice the number of “Moldovans” (ethnic Romanians from the historical principality of Moldova that united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania) in Romania than in R of Moldova and they are truly indistinguishable. We havwe the reality of divided Koreas due to the US and the reality of divided Romanians due to USSR/Russia. Of course, Brussels hates nationalism with passion, so the idea of national reunification is not in item to discus. I have been sucked into the YouTube rabbit hole in recent weeks. (I admit to avoiding politics and news as of late.) Among my suggested channels of interest are cruises, crochet and…wait for it…RV and stealth van living. I fully admit to finding the videos of how to live in one’s car, van, or modified box truck to be fascinating. And the levels at which it is being done are pretty wide ranging. Real RVs do appear to be the choice of the well off, with a few exceptions. Car living seems to be largely lower income or early in the career, with a few better off who just find it fascinating and do it part time for the challenge of both setting up a system especially for bad weather. The stealth step vans and box trucks appears to have the widest range of financial state. And those often have the most telling statements about the ability to do this. They are the ones who don’t want to or can’t afford to live in the increasingly private equity owned RV parks. And they point out that their options for being to park the vehicle are tightening and are much harder to find, both because there are so many people doing it and it freaks the businesses and people who live in the neighborhoods where they used to be able park out. This isn’t to say that the WSJ is wrong or right. Just that this anecdotal evidence is indicating that there is an increase and a response so the noose is tightening and that this is yet another alternative housing option which the traditionally homeless may not have access to much longer. I met an Ozzie years ago RVing across USA who hated it, and us. He said he couldn’t park for the night anywhere in America without someone rapping on his window, banging on the windshield, demanding to know what’s the big idea, parking here? Nothing remotely like it had ever happened in Oz. Are Americans psycho? Or are there just 20 times as many of us? I say both. re: Taibbi on Kimmel/Berenson As Jimmy Kimmel Becomes a Speech Icon, Alex Berenson Fights on Alone An imperious talk show host won the love of Hollywood and the ACLU, but to stop government pressure on companies, speech defenders need to recognize Alex Berenson https://www.racket.news/p/as-jimmy-kimmel-becomes-a-speech “Not that it matters, but while Kimmel was threatened for inaccuracy, Berenson’s problems stemmed from being too accurate about the mRNA Covid vaccines, about everything from studies showing surprising inefficacy to potential links to myocarditis that even Biden’s CDC eventually acknowledged. Critics have gone after other Berenson statements, but the ones that got him in trouble were exactly what the Founders had in mind when they thought about speech: true statements made in opposition to an official propaganda campaign. The last straw was this accurate tweet from August 28, 2021: It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission. Don’t think of it as a vaccine. Think of it—at best—as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it? Insanity. Berenson’s removal marked the end of a five-month campaign that involved current and former high-level officials from Pfizer and multiple government agencies. Onetime Biden official Andy Slavitt commemorated Berenson’s silencing by posting a screenshot of Berenson’s locked account. That tweet is still live:” Does anybody know, or can explain what is meant by ” (resilc) ” used in these links?

Trump really does own Ukraine General Assembly Updates: After Meeting With Zelensky at U.N., Trump Shifts Stance on Russia High as a kite man President Trump said Ukraine might be able to reclaim all its lost territory in the war against Russia. Earlier, he suggested NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft that enter their airspace. Trump believes everything that Kellogg tells him – who gets all his information straight from Zelensky. So we are well past the point where it was Biden’s war and now it is Trump’s war. He now owns it lock, stock & barrel and if the Ukraine collapses, the Neocons and the main stream media will put the blame all on him. Trump’s UN speech excerpts 1) I ended seven wars. And in all cases, they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. A vicious violent war that was Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia and Armenia and Azerbaijan. 2) These are the two things I got from the United Nations.

Title: ASML Stock: An Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/asml-stock-an-overlooked-ai-play/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse recognized as one of the most crucial firms in the semiconductor ecosystem, has witnessed its stock rise almost 25% in the last month, bouncing back from a decline in July following its Q2 earnings report, which sparked worries about demand for 2026. ASML’s significance lies in its distinctive function: it manufactures the machines that enable the production of the world's most advanced chips, making it essential to the entire semiconductor value chain. With the stock gaining momentum, is now the right time to invest? To provide context, here’s what ASML specializes in. ASML produces the most advanced manufacturing tools in the semiconductor sector, and arguably, the entire world. Its standout product is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These devices utilize ultra-short light wavelengths to engrave fine circuit patterns on silicon wafers, facilitating the manufacture of the leading-edge chips of 5 nanometers and below. Put simply, without ASML, the processors that power AI data centers, smartphones, and even contemporary vehicles would not be possible. Thus, ASML stands out as a unique enterprise. EUV technology plays a vital role in prolonging Moore’s Law, a long-held industry trend whereby transistor density doubles roughly every two years, enabling chipmakers to keep pushing the boundaries of computing capabilities and cost efficiency. See AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC Multiple factors have shifted sentiment to be more favorable for ASML recently. To start, U.S. tariffs on semiconductor equipment, which include ASML’s lithography machines, were avoided thanks to a U.S.-EU trade agreement that exempts semiconductor production equipment from tariffs. This alleviated a significant worry for ASML's stock. Regarding demand, investment in AI remains robust. Major players like Nvidia and Broadcom are experiencing substantial growth as the increase in training and executing intricate models drives demand for high-performance semiconductors—the very kind ASML’s machines enable to manufacture. Indeed, the company reports that many of its largest customers are already increasing their EUV capacity to match the escalating need for AI chips. To illustrate the scale of these investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) indicated a potential cumulative capital expenditure of $364 billion for their respective current fiscal years. Much of this could translate into heightened demand for ASML. Importantly, ASML’s largest client, TSMC, reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue through August 2025. This impressive revenue growth is attributed to advanced nodes such as 3nm and 5nm, with the scaling up of 2nm chips expected to further stimulate demand for ASML’s EUV machinery. ASML stock is currently trading at 36x projected FY2025 earnings, which is slightly high, but there are positive signs for the stock. According to consensus estimates, ASML’s revenues are set to increase by a robust 14% this year. During the past quarter, ASML recorded net bookings of 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion), approximately 25% above expectations, and a historic backlog of 33 billion euros ($38 billion). With lead times of 12 to 18 months for most of its offerings, current orders should accurately reflect customer confidence well into 2026, suggesting favorable prospects for future revenue growth. Additionally, the company’s dominant market position, cutting-edge and proprietary technology, and its connection to the generative AI trend could also render the stock appealing. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating impressive returns for investors. Separately, if you seek potential upside with less volatility than individual stocks like ASML, you might consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they’ve exhibited a smoother trajectory, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The chipmaker said Monday it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered AI systems. A gigawatt is equal to one billion watts of power—enough electricity to supply millions of homes. We're proud to announce a landmark partnership with @OpenAI to build new gigascale AI factories using millions of NVIDIA GPUs. 🤝 This partnership will supply 10 gigawatts of GPUs to fuel @OpenAI's data center growth. pic.twitter.com/CYEB2PdfWY — NVIDIA (@nvidia) September 22, 2025 According to a report by Bloomberg, the money will be provided in stages, with the first $10 billion coming when the deal is signed, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia will receive OpenAI equity as part of the deal. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) rose 4% from $177.50 to $184.16 on news of the partnership. In an interview with CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the deal the next leap forward for artificial intelligence. “The computing demand is going through the roof,” Jensen said. “This partnership is about building an AI infrastructure that enables AI to go from the labs into the world. This is about the AI industrial revolution arriving.” The plan calls for vast new data centers filled with millions of GPUs, including its upcoming Vera Rubin platform, designed for training and running next-generation models. The first gigawatt of capacity is expected to go online in the second half of 2026, with the rest rolling out as Nvidia ramps its investment. Joining Huang were OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman. Altman said the deal with Nvidia will expand the ambitions set by the Stargate project announced by President Donald Trump in January. “This is the fuel we need to drive improvement—to build better models, generate revenue, everything,” Altman said. “This is helping us, along with our partners at Stargate, Microsoft, and Oracle, to build increasing amounts of infrastructure to deliver on what the world is demanding.” Deploying 10 gigawatts of computing capacity won’t be simple, however. Cooling alone can consume nearly 40% of a data center’s power use, according to energy consultancy 174 Power Global. Environmental concerns are also mounting. Deloitte estimates data centers will account for about 2% of global electricity use in 2025, or 536 terawatt-hours, but says demand from power-hungry AI could push that figure to more than 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2030. The United Nations Environment Programme has warned of rising water consumption for cooling, while the Environmental and Energy Study Institute said data centers are already straining electric grids.

Title: Gold Is Pricier Than Ever. Here's Why Experts See It Rising Even Higher

Gold prices climbed to a record high Monday, extending a blistering rally that experts don't expect to end anytime soon. Gold futures surged 2% Monday to trade at an all-time high of about $3,780 an ounce. The real gold price, which adjusts for inflation, hit a record high earlier this month for the first time since 1980. In a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank analysts forecast that gold prices could rise above $4,000 by the end of 2025, implying a full-year return of more than 50%. That kind of price appreciation would make gold the year’s best-performing asset and likely put it in the top decile of S&P 500 stocks, on par with Nvidia (NVDA). Investors often acquire gold as a hedge against inflation, political turmoil and economic uncertainty, and some investing experts recommend increasing exposure to the precious metal given current market conditions. Bullion, as well as exchange-traded funds tied to gold or to shares of miners, could provide entry points. The reasons behind gold's stellar year are plentiful and interrelated. Central bank demand, a weaker dollar, President Donald Trump's tariffs, and interest rates all bear some responsibility and are expected to continue to support gold prices in the coming months. Conflict in Europe and the Middle East, as well as simmering tensions between the U.S. and China, have given central banks around the world reason to be major buyers of gold this year. According to the World Gold Council’s 2025 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, 95% of central bankers expect global gold reserves to increase this year, and a record 43% forecast their own bank’s reserves would increase over the same period. No respondents said they expected their reserves to decline this year, despite record gold prices. Geopolitical crises are a major reason central banks add to their gold reserves. Gold’s performance during times of crisis was either highly or somewhat relevant to their gold portfolio, said 85% of respondents, and 71% cited its role as a geopolitical risk hedge. Gold buying is also being driven by a desire to diversify reserves. Nearly three-quarters of respondents expect the U.S. dollar’s share of global reserves to decline over the next year as banks add gold and other currencies such as the euro and Chinese renminbi. The value of the U.S. dollar has declined precipitously this year amid a dramatic reset of the domestic and international economic outlooks. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined more than 10% this year. The vast majority of the index’s losses came when trade uncertainty and global tensions were at their highest from early March to early July. Concerns that tariffs and Trump’s immigration crackdown would slow U.S. growth, and potentially push the economy into a recession, weighed on the dollar through those months. The decline may have also partially been driven by de-dollarization or the “Sell America” trade, in which foreign investors, spooked by the Trump administration, dumped dollars and Treasurys. A weaker greenback is expected to continue to be a tailwind for gold, which is priced in dollars, through the rest of the year. “I think almost certainly gold will close above $4,000 before the end of this year,” Jeffrey Gundlach, the founder and CEO of investment manager DoubleLine Capital, told CNBC last week. Gundlach said his ideal portfolio would be 25% gold, an allocation he called “not excessive” in light of dollar trends that he expects to persist. The Federal Reserve is also aiding gold. The central bank cut interest rates last week for the first time this year, and tentatively forecast two more cuts before the end of 2025. A lower federal funds rate should translate into lower Treasury yields, making gold—which doesn’t pay interest—relatively more attractive to investors who have already funneled a record $85 billion into gold funds this year, according to fund flows data from Bank of America. President Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve have also raised questions about the central bank’s independence. If the White House exerts more control over the Fed, which appears likely given Trump will appoint a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell next May, it could erode faith in U.S. monetary policy, further bolstering gold by weakening investors’ confidence in the economic outlook, the U.S. dollar, and Treasurys.

Title: S&P 500 Gain & Losses Today: Oracle, Nvidia Shares Advance; Kenvue Stock Slips

Shares of a semiconductor testing company rose Monday after an analyst highlighted strong demand trends and collaboration with a major chip-industry player. Meanwhile, reports of an impending product safety announcement dragged down shares of a consumer health firm. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher as plans by Nvidia (NVDA) to invest up to $100 million in ChatGPT maker OpenAI reinvigorated optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, extending its streak of all-time closing highs to three consecutive sessions. The Dow ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, with both setting their own fresh closing records. Shares of Nvidia finished 4% higher. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots. While the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices removed guidance calling for all people to be vaccinated against COVID and now recommends that patients consult with their doctor before receiving the shot, the panel opted not to require patients to obtain a prescription for the vaccine. Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Monday afternoon, boosted by the tech sector as Nvidia (NVDA) announced a $100 billion investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia led gains on the Dow, and was among the day's best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Shares of several Nvidia partners such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Micron Technology (MU) also rose. Teradyne (TER) shares jumped as Susquehanna raised the price target of the semiconductor equipment maker to $200 from $133, pointing to growth in demand expected next year and beyond. Shares of other companies that make equipment used to manufacture chips, including Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML (ASML), and Lam Research (LRCX), climbed as well. Apple (AAPL) shares surged as Wedbush lifted its price target for the tech giant's stock to a new Street high of $310 from $270 on signs of better-than-expected demand for the iPhone 17. Metsera (MTSR) shares soared after Pfizer (PFE) said it would buy the biopharma firm for up to $7.3 billion as it looks to profit from soaring demand for weight-loss medicines. Pfizer shares rose as well. Shares of real estate brokerage Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS), which owns Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and others, took off after rival Compass (COMP) announced it was acquiring Anywhere. Compass shares slid. Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) saw its shares slump following reports the White House is expected to make an announcement linking pregnant women’s use of the painkiller to autism. Coinbase Global (COIN) shares lost ground as prices for most major cryptocurrencies fell. Gold futures climbed to record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen.
