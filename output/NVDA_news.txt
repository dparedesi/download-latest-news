Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Election 2024 coverage presented by Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR). Bitcoin (BTC)-holder MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) soaring stock is driving up trading volumes relative to AI-proxy Nvidia (NVDA), one of the biggest companies by market cap, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm. MSTR has surged over 240% this year, with prices doubling to $236 in the past five weeks alone, according to data source TradingView. That’s the highest level for the stock since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago. The rally has MSTR closing in on a market cap of $50 billion, barely 1.5% of NVDA’s $3.44 trillion. However, MSTR’s trading volume, as a percentage against NVDA, has continued to climb this year, reaching a high of 17.65% this month. According to Investing.com data, this milestone occurred on Oct. 11, as MicroStrategy saw 30 million trading volume, while NVIDIA had 170 million. That’s a significant improvement since the bull market of 2021. Back then, MSTR peaked over $130 on Feb. 9 with a volume of 23.2 million, equating to just 8% of NVDA that day. An increase in trading volumes alongside a price rally may confirm the stock's uptrend. That said, a continued surge in volume relative to NVDA might be telling of a build up of a speculative froth in the market. With a year-to-date gain of over 240%, MSTR has outperformed NVDA’s 192% surge by a big margin. Since MSTR adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset in August 2020, the gap has grown even bigger, with MSTR up 1,800% versus NVDA’s 1,150%, that’s probably the best evidence of MicroStrategy and its CEO Michael Saylor’s success. MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV), which is is calculated by dividing MSTR's market capitalization by the value of its bitcoin stack, continues to expand once again, with bitcoin still trending in the mid $60,000 range. According to the MSTR tracker, the NAV premium currently sits at almost 3, the highest level since early 2021. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?

CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock alone has created more value in the last three years than the combined market cap of 250 companies in the S&P 500. Talk about the 1% — specifically, $3 trillion! But everyone knows that. The bigger question is: what’s next? Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia at this point? In our recent analyses, we argued for a range of outcomes: Nvidia’s road to $300 and the counterpoint Nvidia’s downside to $40. Intuitive Surgical is No Dud Either — Here’s Path to 10x NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular – as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now, below are the facts, and a concrete view of how you might want to think of Nvidia in your portfolio. Answer: Add Nvidia to your portfolio in the amount such that while you sit envisioning a 5x gain in the long term, you’re also willing to stomach 50% loss at any time during the ride. Yep, be willing to bear short-term pain - the price you’ll pay - to be rewarded in the long run. This sounds simple in theory but is never easy to live by in practice. Below are more specifics on the pros and cons. Here’s the thing, competition is heating up. AMD isn’t sitting idle - the company has doubled down on AI-focused GPUs and claims its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s in several areas. Intel is also emerging as a competitor, gaining traction with value-priced AI chips. Moreover, big tech players like Google - one of Nvidia’s biggest customers - are developing their own AI and machine learning silicon. With these rivals, the rapid growth in Nvidia’s revenues and the unusually high levels of Nvidia’s cash-flow margins (over 50% in recent quarters) may not be sustainable. The underlying economics of the AI GPU market remain weak, with most of Nvidia’s customers still unprofitable. Why is that? Large language models are expensive to build and train and the payoff can take a long time. VC firm Sequoia estimates that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, possibly exceeding $100 billion when including other costs. Yet, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few services besides ChatGPT gaining large, paying user bases. We may well be in an AI “FOMO phase,” where companies feel compelled to invest in AI simply because their competitors are. As shareholders seek better returns, capital spending may cool off, impacting companies like Nvidia. Separately, large AI deployments follow two stages. The first is the compute-intensive training phase, during which AI models are built from large datasets with GPUs being used to process data and adjust the model’s parameters. The second stage is the deployment phase, where trained models run in real-world applications and typically require lower processing power, allowing companies to use less expensive hardware to run models for daily tasks. As the AI revolution began just about two years ago, most companies are in the training phase and there is a possibility that demand could ease off as we move towards lower power inferencing. Nvidia has had a head start in the AI market. And it has the foresight to not let its early mover advantage slip away. The company has built a comprehensive ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages and software, which can lock customers into its products as they scale up their AI investments. Nvidia’s extensive software stack - including CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT - not only enhances performance but also simplifies AI development, making it increasingly difficult and costly for companies to switch to alternative platforms. Look at it this way. As companies deploy their AI bets they will be spending time and resources on training, tuning their AI models, and integrating these tools into their broader IT systems and workflows. This makes it more difficult and costly to shift to competitors. The ecosystem could help to protect Nvidia’s margins, with software-related sales also likely expanding in the long run. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal meaning that they work with speech, images, video, and 3D content - calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power - particularly with processors - outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. The shift in U.S. monetary policy could also give Nvidia an extra lift. The Fed’s 50 basis point cut - the first in nearly four years - brings the federal funds rate to 4.75%-5%, with room for further reductions. Lower rates boost growth sectors like tech by increasing the present value of future earnings. The rate cuts are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move?

Title: Intel's former CEO tried to buy Nvidia almost 2 decades ago

Time Published: 2024-10-24T14:50:58Z

Tech pioneer Intel (INTC) has seemingly missed out on the artificial intelligence boom — and part of it can reportedly be traced back to a decision not to buy the chipmaker at the center of it all almost two decades ago. Intel’s former chief executive Paul Otellini wanted to buy Nvidia in 2005 when the chipmaker was mostly known for making computer graphics chips, which some executives thought had potential for data centers, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. However, Intel’s board did not approve of the $20 billion acquisition — which would’ve been the company’s most expensive yet — and Otellini dropped the effort, according to The New York Times. Instead, the board was reportedly more interested in an in-house graphics project called Larrabee, which was led by now-chief executive Pat Gelsinger. Almost two decades later, Nvidia (NVDA) has become the second-most valuable public company in the world and continuously exceeds Wall Street’s high expectations. Intel, on the other hand, has seen its shares fall around 53% so far this year and is now worth less than $100 billion — around 30 times less than Nvidia’s $3.4 trillion market cap. In August, Intel shares fell 27% after it missed revenue expectations with its second-quarter earnings and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to its decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. And Nvidia wasn’t the only AI darling Intel missed out on. Over a decade after passing on Nvidia, Intel made another strategic miss by reportedly deciding not to buy a stake in OpenAI, which had not yet kicked off the current AI hype with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Former Intel chief executive Bob Swan didn’t think OpenAI’s generative AI models would come to market soon enough for the investment to be worth it, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The AI startup had been interested in Intel, sources told Reuters (TRI), so it could depend less on Nvidia and build its own infrastructure.

Title: Analyst Raises Microsoft (MSFT) Price Target On Increasing IT Spending

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a dominant force in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip markets, continues to capture investor attention with its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. As the company navigates through a period of unprecedented growth and innovation, it faces both significant opportunities and potential hurdles. NVIDIA's financial trajectory has been nothing short of impressive. The company has consistently outperformed market expectations, with analysts projecting substantial revenue growth from $60.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 to over $200 billion by fiscal year 2027. This remarkable expansion is primarily driven by the surging demand for AI chips and accelerated computing solutions. Earnings per share (EPS) are expected to see a similar upward trend, with estimates ranging from $1.15 in FY2024 to as high as $4.85 by FY2027. This projected growth has led many analysts to maintain bullish outlooks on NVIDIA's stock, with price targets ranging from $135 to $180. Despite these positive projections, NVIDIA faces some near-term challenges. The company has reported potential gross margin pressures due to the transition to its next-generation "Blackwell" GPU architecture. Some analysts anticipate a temporary dip in margins as the company ramps up production of these new chips, though this is generally viewed as a short-term issue that should resolve as yields improve. At the heart of NVIDIA's success lies its relentless focus on innovation. The company's current flagship AI chip, the Hopper architecture, has seen strong demand from cloud service providers and enterprises alike. However, much attention is focused on the upcoming Blackwell GPU, which is expected to drive significant revenue growth in the coming years. Recent reports have indicated a slight delay in the Blackwell architecture due to performance issues and chip respins. While this has caused some concern among investors, many analysts view this as a minor setback in the broader context of NVIDIA's product roadmap. The company is expected to begin shipping customer samples of Blackwell in the near term, with volume production ramping up in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. NVIDIA's ability to quickly address technical challenges and provide alternative solutions has been a hallmark of its success. The company's CUDA programming platform continues to be a significant competitive advantage, offering developers a robust ecosystem for AI and high-performance computing applications. NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market is undeniable, with an estimated market share exceeding 95% in data center AI training and inference chips. This commanding position has allowed the company to capitalize on the explosive growth in AI investments across various industries. The total addressable market (TAM) for AI servers is expanding rapidly, with projections suggesting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 60% from 2023 to 2027. NVIDIA is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of this growth, given its strong relationships with hyperscalers and increasing penetration into enterprise markets. However, competition in the semiconductor space is intensifying. Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are making significant investments in AI chip development, while cloud giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are exploring custom chip designs. NVIDIA's ability to maintain its technological edge and ecosystem advantages will be crucial in fending off these competitive threats. The data center segment has been the primary driver of NVIDIA's recent growth, with revenues in this area experiencing triple-digit year-over-year increases. This surge is largely attributed to the rapid adoption of AI and machine learning technologies across various industries. Hyperscale customers, including major cloud service providers, continue to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Capital expenditure (CapEx) from these customers is seen as a key indicator of demand for NVIDIA's systems, with recent quarters showing significant growth. Some analysts project that peak CapEx spending may not occur until late 2025, suggesting a prolonged period of strong demand for NVIDIA's products. Enterprise adoption of AI technologies is also accelerating, presenting another avenue for growth. NVIDIA's efforts to expand its presence in on-premises AI solutions and edge computing are expected to contribute to its long-term revenue diversification. While AI and data center applications have taken center stage, NVIDIA's gaming business remains a significant contributor to its overall revenue. The company maintains a dominant position in the gaming GPU market, with a market share exceeding 75% in PC graphics cards. Analysts anticipate continued healthy demand from both esports enthusiasts and casual gamers, driven by ongoing product refresh cycles and the increasing graphical demands of modern games. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming service also represents a potential growth avenue as the company expands its presence in the gaming ecosystem. Other segments, such as professional visualization and automotive, are also showing promise. The automotive sector, in particular, is seen as a long-term growth opportunity as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies become more prevalent. Despite NVIDIA's strong market position and growth prospects, the company faces several risks that warrant investor attention. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those involving China and Taiwan, pose potential threats to NVIDIA's supply chain and market access. The company's heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for chip production is a point of concern given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties in the region. Additionally, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for market saturation in certain segments could impact NVIDIA's growth trajectory. The company's ability to maintain its technological lead and fend off increasing competition will be crucial in sustaining its current market position. As competitors like AMD and Intel ramp up their AI chip development efforts, NVIDIA may face increased pressure on its market share and pricing power. Custom chip designs from major cloud providers could also reduce reliance on NVIDIA's products in certain applications. This intensified competition could lead to margin compression and slower growth rates in the long term. While the reported delay in the Blackwell architecture is not expected to significantly impact NVIDIA's long-term earnings, repeated delays or technical issues could erode customer confidence and provide opportunities for competitors to gain ground. This could result in lost revenue opportunities and potential market share erosion in key segments. NVIDIA's strong position in the AI chip market, coupled with the rapidly expanding AI server TAM, presents significant growth opportunities. As AI adoption accelerates across industries, NVIDIA's full-stack ecosystem and technological advantages could allow it to capture a substantial portion of this growing market. The company's ability to innovate and provide end-to-end solutions for AI workloads positions it well for sustained long-term growth. The projected 60% CAGR in the AI server market from 2023 to 2027 represents a massive opportunity for NVIDIA. As enterprises increasingly adopt AI technologies for various applications, including inference at the edge, NVIDIA's diverse product portfolio and strong brand recognition could drive significant revenue growth. The company's efforts to expand into new verticals and geographies could further amplify these opportunities. NVIDIA Corporation continues to be a focal point for investors and analysts alike, with its strong market position in AI chips and GPUs driving optimistic outlooks. While the company faces challenges such as increased competition and potential product delays, its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in high-growth markets suggest significant potential for continued expansion. As NVIDIA navigates the evolving landscape of AI and accelerated computing, its ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial in maintaining its leadership position and delivering value to shareholders.

Title: Nvidia Launches Danish Sovereign AI Supercomputer That Novo Nordisk Will Use
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-danish-sovereign-ai-supercomputer-novo-nordisk-drug-discovery-8732961
Time Published: 2024-10-23T21:16:14Z

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) plans to use Denmark's first sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer—powered by Nvidia (NVDA) technology—for drug discovery. On Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled "Gefion": a supercomputer named after a goddess in Danish mythology and equipped with 1,528 Nvidia GPUs. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks, Nvidia said. "The era of computer-aided drug discovery must be within this decade," Huang said in a news release. "I’m hoping that what the computer did to the technology industry, it will do for digital biology." The Novo Nordisk Foundation owns the supercomputer, and Novo Nordisk — the company behind popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy— will be among the first to use it. The foundation owns all of Novo Nordisk's Class A shares, which represent about a quarter of the company's capital. Nvidia and Denmark are “inventing something fundamentally new,” with the launch of Gefion, Huang said. “Gefion is going to be a factory of intelligence," Huang said. "This is a new industry that never existed before. It sits on top of the IT industry.” Novo Nordisk, along with the University of Copenhagen and others, are building a “genomic foundation model for discoveries in disease mutation analysis and vaccine design,” by training larger language models on Gefion. Other Gefion pilot projects include a Danish Meteorological Institute effort to deliver faster and more accurate weather forecasts and a University of Copenhagen project to carry out a large-scale simulation of quantum computer circuits.

GPUs, or graphic processing units, have become increasingly difficult to acquire as tech giants like OpenAI and Meta purchase mountains of them to power A.I. models. Amid an ongoing chip shortage, a crop of startups are stepping up to increase access to the highly sought-after A.I. chips—by renting them out. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The GPU rental market is part of a niche, existing industry known as GPU-as-a-service where chip owners use an online marketplace to sell compute power to clients over fixed periods of time through the cloud. Typically, companies turn to major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud—which collectively hold a 63 percent market share of the global cloud computing market—to run A.I. workloads on their on-premise data centers. GPU-as-as-service, however, provides a more decentralized approach. Providers in that space partner with data centers and GPU owners globally to rent their clusters of chips to clients whenever the need arises. Renting computer power allows organizations with tight budgets, such as startups and academic institutions, access to high-performance GPUs for specific projects, said David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. “GPU-as-a-service has significantly leveled the playing field in A.I. and high-performance computing,” Bader told Observer. “Instead of making substantial upfront investments in hardware that quickly depreciates and becomes obsolete, companies can now access GPU power on-demand.” Even as supply chain constraints around GPUs start to ease, the rental market continues to grow. The GPU-as-a-service market, valued at $3.79 billion as of 2023, is expected to grow 21.5 percent annually to $12.26 billion by 2030 as the demand for advanced data analytics, like running machine learning algorithms, increases, according to data from Grand View Research. Some startups in the GPU rental space have seen demand surging since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022 as companies seek out compute power to build A.I. Jake Cannell, founder and CEO of Vast.ai, said his company’s customers were primarily cryptocurrency miners before the generative A.I. hype began. Today, more than half of the projects run on Vast.ai’s GPU rentals are A.I.-related. Clients include A.I. entrepreneurs, startups and academics building custom large language models with foundational models like OpenAI’s GPT and deploying LLMs on A.I.-related workloads like A.I.-image generator Stable Diffusion, Cannell said. The release of ChatGPT, combined with high demand for major cloud providers and the GPU shortage, pushed more customers to look for alternative options, which has in part accelerated demand for Vast.ai’s GPU rentals, according to Cannell. “That’s probably relaxed a bit now that production has caught up, but demand still seems really high and growing,” the CEO said. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips has been “insane” and that the company, which owns about 90 percent of the GPU market, plans to ramp up Blackwell production this year through 2026. Launched in 2017, Vast.ai is behind an online marketplace that connects owners of GPU clusters from Nvidia and AMD with organizations looking to rent compute power. As of late October, the marketplace offers 109 clusters of GPUs—including Nvidia’s popular H100 chips—housed in data centers and, in some cases, the owners’ garages scattered across the U.S. Europe, Asia and Australia, according to Cannell. By offering GPU clusters with different capacities, speeds and system requirements for various lengths of time, Vast.ai aims to provide renters with the freedom to pick GPUs required for specific projects and scale up-and-down depending on their need. For instance, a client developing an A.I. chatbot may initially rent 100 GPUs to train their model. If their product takes off, the client could ramp up their compute capacity by renting out thousands of GPUs. The flexibility to access different amounts of compute at different stages of product development, the company claims, is what makes GPU rentals over purchasing chips appealing. “Buying would only make sense if you have a much more predictable, steady demand for GPUs over a very long period of time,” Cannell said. “Only the hypercalers can formulate that,” referring to industry giants like OpenAI. While startups like Vast.ai launched prior to ChatGPT are seeing an uptick in interest, new startups have emerged following the chatbot’s release to tap into the growing GPU rental market. Foundry, a GPU marketplace built specifically for A.I. workloads, claims it has attracted “dozens” of customers since it launched its cloud platform in August and can significantly reduce compute costs by tapping into the excess power supply of pre-existing chips, according to CEO Jared Quincy Davis. The startup, which raised $80 million from investors like Sequoia and Lightspeed Ventures as of March, rents out GPUs through a mix of compute clusters the company owns and “underutilized clusters” sourced from partnerships with data centers. Foundry’s customers include companies in the technology, telecommunications, media and health care industries. Foundations and academic labs also use Foundry’s services. Common use cases include fine-tuning models like Meta’s Llama to exhibit desirable properties, building neural networks from scratch, and performing sentiment analyses—a deep learning technique used to analyze text to determine its emotional tone. Foundry even has clients renting GPUs to predict protein sequences for drug discovery, train models to translate rare languages, and build A.I. agents that can control websites without human intervention. “Much of the cutting-edge development that could previously only be conducted by labs like OpenAI and DeepMind will now be obtainable by others as Foundry makes GPU compute more accessible and affordable,” Davis, who previously worked at Google DeepMind as an engineer, told Observer. Some organizations are seeing the benefits of GPU rentals materialize. Bader, the professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology, said he’s seen his university use the GPU rental approach to “free up resources” for “critical activities” like research and development. The GPU rental model, he claims, is ideal for projects with “temporary” or “seasonal compute needs” and “eliminates the burden” of costly hardware management and maintenance. Bader said he has also seen small businesses the university collaborates with access the same GPU power as larger businesses. “I’ve witnessed countless startups benefit from this,” Bader said. “They no longer need millions in upfront investment for specialized hardware. Instead, they can prototype, test and iterate their algorithms using rented GPUs, ensuring that funds are directed towards development rather than infrastructure.” Still, Bader noted that renting out GPUs over purchasing them comes with some trade-offs. Performance on shared infrastructure can be inconsistent, which could slow down the execution of tasks like A.I. model training if there’s service disruptions. GPU rentals could also get expensive down the line despite upfront cost savings. The costs of transferring data between the cloud and the company could “add up quickly,” and for workloads that require real-time processing, clients that continuously hit latency issues might end up paying more than if they owned GPUs, according to Bader. The lack of control over the infrastructure could also be “problematic” for companies with strict security and compliance protocols. The future of the GPU rental market could also depend on how the chip industry evolves. After all, major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services are expected to continue expanding their product lines and are likely to absorb smaller companies, which could lower prices in the short term and limit consumer choice in the long run, according to Bader. Plus, supply chain delays could make it harder for cloud giants to get their hands on GPUs. Despite these concerns, the startups that spoke to Observer remain confident there will still be a need for their services in the following years as A.I. continues to grow. Vast.ai continues to improve its GPU matchmaker service and is getting more directly involved in use cases like LLM inference, especially for A.I. agents. Foundry plans to release additional features to increase the accessibility for its platform and make it more useful for A.I. developers to build advanced models. “Nvidia is still a leader, and I don’t see that changing overnight, but there is increasingly more competition,” Vast.ai CEO Cannnell said.

Title: Big Tech is going all in on nuclear power as sustainability concerns around AI grow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour. Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.

Title: Stock Market Predictions For 2025: What Is Coming Next Year?

getty Explore stock market predictions for 2025 and what may be coming next year. Learn key trends, forecasts, and insights to help guide your investment decisions. (search description) So far, 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year for stocks. With interest rates expected to fall further, it's easy to assume next year could be another win for equity investors—if only the financial markets were that simple. In reality, there are real risks and uncertainties in play for 2025. While many analysts expect the year to be positive for stocks, several factors could introduce volatility along the way. Prepare yourself for what may lie ahead with this expert-informed overview of risks, sectors to watch and S&P 500 predictions for next year. Through mid-October, the S&P 500 is up 22.5% year to date. The growth followed last year's gain of 24%. 2022 was less profitable. In that year, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20%. You may remember that 2022 was the year the Fed began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Those moves raised bond yields, encouraging investors to shift away from stocks in favor of debt securities. This rise-and-fall cycle is typical for the U.S. stock market and economy. The good times typically last longer, but weaker financial markets and economies can be more traumatic—emotionally and financially. The thing to remember is that no stock market climate is permanent. Whether stock prices are heading up or down, there is always a reversal ahead. Keeping that in mind can help you manage whatever's in store for 2025 and beyond.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days Pundits are largely optimistic about the U.S. financial markets in 2025, but with a good dose of caution. Global financial markets are more intertwined today than ever, which makes U.S. stocks more sensitive to a broader range of factors. Five factors to watch in 2025 are the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, domestic inflation and interest rates, technology innovation, global economic trends and rising geopolitical tensions. I expand on each of these factors below. Justin Zacks, vice president of strategy at Moomoo Technologies, and Michael Martin, vice president of market strategy at TradingBlock, expect the 2024 presidential election to have a major influence on the stock market next year. Zacks believes the first 100 days of either president's term will set the tone for the next four years. Martin points to the U.S. tariff policy and the national deficit as hot-button issues for the next president. New tariffs could slow the U.S. economy, Martin explains, which in turn could cause inflation worries to linger into 2026 and beyond. The deficit, unchecked, could contribute to the continued devaluation of the U.S. dollar. A breakdown of trust in the U.S. dollar could push investors to "alternative stores of value like gold and bitcoin," according to Martin. The Fed lowered interest rates in September after inflation finally dipped below 3% over the summer. Many analysts expect the Fed to continue cutting rates in small increments as inflation drops softly down to 2%. Unfortunately there are risks to this plan. Zacks believes there is a possibility we'll see stagflation next year, for example. Stagflation is persistent inflation despite a softening economy and labor market. He cites changing tariff policies and geopolitical tensions as potential catalysts. Martin questions whether the Fed's 2% inflation target is realistic. If it's not and rates remain higher as a new normal, profit margins could suffer. Broadly lower profitability will stifle stock market growth. Technological innovation has recently been a primary growth driver for the stock market, creating some of the best stocks of 2024. As an example, semiconductor company Nvidia (NVDA) has increased its stock price by 178% by decisively monetizing demand for high-performance computing resources. Nvidia's graphics processing units are a preferred resource for machine learning workloads. For better or worse, the stock market will respond to further developments in artificial intelligence in 2025. One uncertainty is whether AI can deliver on its promises of efficiency and productivity. Billions are being spent on AI development and the return expectations are high. Many experts believe AI will prove itself, fueling higher earnings expectations and, in turn, higher stock prices. Angelina Hu, global head of investor relations at SALT Venture Group, cites ongoing economic slowness in China as a potential limitation for stock market growth in 2025. A sluggish Chinese economy weakens demand for U.S. exports. China's finance ministry has announced plans for a stimulus package, but the details of that program are still unknown. Companies with significant exposure to China may experience volatility as the stimulus plans take shape. Thus far, the war in Ukraine and rising conflict in the Middle East have not created major problems in the U.S. financial markets. This could change if unrest escalates to the point of disrupting global trade or commodities supply, according to Zacks. Another concern is the engagement of U.S. troops on foreign soil, which would likely sour investor sentiment and take a toll on stock prices in the process.

Elevate your journey by becoming a Forbes member. Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days Three sectors to watch next year are technology, healthcare and energy. For added context, see this list of the best investing sectors for 2024. Market intelligence company IDC expects worldwide spending on AI to more than double between 2024 and 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. The investments will go towards AI-enabled applications, hardware, including semiconductors, storage systems and servers, plus related services such as cloud computing. McKinsey has predicted healthcare profits will grow at a 7% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Expected profit drivers after 2024 include cost efficiencies and higher reimbursement rates. Industry-wide margin expansion will be supported by greater use of health services and technology (HST) firms. HST firms help insurance companies, health systems and life-sciences companies identify revenue opportunities and cut costs with data and analytics. This is expected to be a fast-growing segment within healthcare. With a growing tech sector comes higher energy demands. For context, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has estimated that AI chatbots like ChatGPT use 10 times the electricity of an internet search. In 2023, fossil fuels accounted for 60% of U.S. electricity generation, while renewable energy sources provided 21%. Fossil fuels will continue to play an important role in the energy ecosystem in the near term. Renewable solar, wind and hydro power will also see greater demand, particularly from data centers and technology companies. Expert predictions for stock market growth in 2025 vary from a 5% decline to growth of 20%. Many pundits are pegging a 10% increase as the most likely scenario. Richard McWhorter, managing partner of Private Wealth Advisor, predicts a range of -5% to 5%, for example. McWhorter cites the elevated multiple of the S&P 500 as a primary factor. He believes earnings must grow into that multiple before the market can deliver double-digit growth. Ed Mahaffy, president and senior portfolio manager at ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, has a more bullish outlook. Citing ongoing innovation in AI and falling interest rates, Mahaffy expects the S&P 500 will end 2025 up 14.5% to 19.6%. Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer for Running Point Capital Advisors, holds a midrange view. Schulman believes the S&P 500 will grow 7% to 11% next year, with volatility along the way. He notes economic growth, earnings expansion, rising mergers and acquisitions activity and lower interest rates as influential factors. As of October, the S&P 500 is hovering around 5,850. If the index declines 5% in 2025, it will end the year at about 5,557. If the index grows 20% next year, it will end the year at about 7,000. Ten percent growth equates to a year-end value of 6,435. Volatility will be a primary challenge for investors in 2025. Uncertainty about the factors noted above, from the outcome of the U.S. election to foreign conflicts, almost ensure the market will have good days and bad ones. High valuations could exacerbate the ups and downs as investors oscillate between fear and greed. Zacks notes that the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is well above its 20-year average. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are major contributors. For context, see this prediction for Tesla stock in 2025. "Companies' earnings will need to continue to grow to justify such valuations," Zacks explains. If earnings come in weaker than expected—for any reason—2025 could be a rough year. Considering the uncertainties at hand, how should you prep your portfolio for next year? Two areas that may warrant adjustments are the composition of your income portfolio and your sector exposures. If you have adjusted your income holdings to favor high-yield cash deposits and bonds in recent years, it may be time to unwind those changes. As interest rates fall, cash deposits will drop, too—making dividend yields look relatively more attractive. Dividend stocks have the additional appeal of having relatively low volatility. These can offer downside protection if the market does get rocky. Sector adjustments can help you capitalize if the Fed continues lowering interest rates. Capital-intensive sectors like technology and industrials tend to get a lift when rates fall. Consumer discretionary stocks will also benefit if cheaper debt encourages spending growth. More consumers may, for example, splurge on luxury vacations or new cars if these can be financed affordably. Banks and consumer staples stocks, on the other hand, are less attractive in lower-rate environments. Banks can see their margins shrink when rates fall, while consumer staples companies can be less popular with investors in growth economies. The prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. Momentum in technology innovation and lower interest rates are generally good for the stock market, but high valuations, global tensions and uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election could pose risks. Now may be the time to diversify across growth and value. Blended exposure offers gain potential plus volatility protection—the best of both worlds. The technology, healthcare and energy sectors are predicted to perform well in 2025. If inflation remains low, the Fed will continue reducing interest rates. Falling interest rates usually have a positive impact on stock prices. Lingering high inflation would sour investor sentiment and put downward pressure on stock prices. Growth stocks and value stocks can play a role in 2025. Many experts believe the stock market will be up next year, albeit with volatility. Growth stocks can provide appreciation potential, while value stocks can offer stability in turbulent times. Lingering inflation and disappointing corporate earnings are the biggest risks the stock market will face in 2025.

Title: Nvidia's CEO says a design flaw in its new AI chip was '100% Nvidia's fault'
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-design-flaw-blackwell-fault-ai-chip-1851679078
Time Published: 2024-10-23T14:19:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) says it has fixed a design flaw in its latest artificial intelligence chips that led to production and shipping delays. The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), to resolve the engineering setback in its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The complexity of the project contributed to the setback. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, according to Huang. The problems first surfaced in August, when Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report that Blackwell’s production was delayed due to a design flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). During the company’s second-quarter earnings that month, Huang said Nvidia shipped samples of Blackwell to customers and that the AI platform’s production would ramp up in the fourth quarter into the next fiscal year. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said during earnings. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. The company said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue” in the fourth quarter. “What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible pace,” Huang said during an appearance in Denmark to unveil the country’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion. The recovery appears successful. In October, Nvidia shares got a boost after Huang said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said during an appearance on CNBC. Nvidia stock closed at a record high of $143.71 per share earlier this week ahead of major technology companies’ earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down 3.3% during mid-day trading on Wednesday but are up around 189% so far this year.

Title: Nvidia's design flaw with Blackwell AI chips now fixed, CEO says

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Supantha Mukherjee COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday a design flaw with its latest Blackwell AI chips which impacted production has been fixed with the help of longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC. Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips in March and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter but were delayed, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's, Google and Microsoft. "We had a design flaw in Blackwell," Huang said. "It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia's fault." According to media reports, the delay in production had caused tensions between Nvidia and TSMC but Huang dismissed that as "fake news". "In order to make a Blackwell computer work, seven different types of chips were designed from scratch and had to be ramped into production at the same time," he said. "What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible place." Nvidia's Blackwell chips take two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them together into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. At a recent Goldman Sachs conference the CEO said the chips will now ship in the fourth quarter. Huang was in Denmark on Wednesday to launch a new supercomputer named Gefion, which boasts 1,528 graphic processing units (GPUs) and was built in partnership with Novo Nordisk Foundation, Denmark's Export and Investment Fund and Nvidia.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Set for Major Upside with New Blackwell AI Chip; Analysts Predict Stock Surge and Continued Market Dominance

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares hit all-time highs Monday, continuing the impressive multi-year run of going from a $1 trillion company to a company worth over $3 trillion. Many Nvidia employees and investors have been rejoicing in the stock gains over the last year and one of the big winners is a member of Congress. What Happened: Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi are among the investors who have been adding Nvidia stock and options to their investment portfolios over the last year. Don’t Miss Out: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!. As a member of Congress, Nancy Pelosi has to disclose the trades made by herself and her husband. In a Dec. 23, 2023 disclosure, the former Speaker of the House reported a purchase made before the Christmas holiday. The purchase was made on Nov. 22, 2023, for 50 call options in Nvidia, with a $120 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. The disclosure listed the purchase price range of $1 million to $5 million. Unusual Whales pinned the purchase to a price of $1.8 million. Nvidia shares traded between $476.90 and $503.35 on Nov. 22, 2023, when the purchase was made. The call options would have been purchased for around $360 each. Fast forward to today and the options have changed after Nvidia conducted a 10-for-1 split in June 2024. The options contracts owned by the Pelosis are now 500 call options with a $12 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. Trending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. On Monday, these $12 call options traded at $132.05, valuing the Pelosis' position at $6,602,500. Based on the estimated cost basis of $1.8 million, the Pelosis are now up $4.8 million on this trade from last November. The options trade isn't the only one the Pelosis made over the last year. The former House Speaker also disclosed buying 10,000 NVDA shares on June 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million, and 10,000 NVDA shares on July 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million. Here's a look at those two purchases based on the intraday highs for Nvidia stock. June 26: 10,000 shares, $128.12 per share, purchase price $1,281,200, now worth $1,437,100 July 26: 10,000 shares, $116.20 per share, purchase price $1,162,000, now worth $1,437,100 The two purchases are now worth $2.87 million and up at least $430,000, depending on the timing of the purchases. Did You Know? Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Missed Profits?: While the Pelosis are now up over $5 million from their purchases of Nvidia stock and options over the last year, they could have been sitting on more profits if they hadn't sold shares back in July 2022. The sale happened after a disclosure of buying Nvidia shares ahead of the CHIPS Act, set to benefit semiconductor stocks, drew scrutiny and increased attention. In a filing, Pelosi reported selling 25,000 Nvidia shares at an average price point of $165.05. The total sale was valued at $4,126,250. The filing shows that the transaction was at a loss of $341,365. The 25,000 shares would now be 250,000 shares based on the stock split from earlier this year. Based on a price of $143.71 for Nvidia shares on Tuesday, the 250,000 shares would be worth $35,927,500. This means the Pelosis missed out on potential profits of $31,801,250 from their sale in July 2022. Nancy Pelosi says she does not share information on congressional activities with her husband. Observers remain skeptical, given the questionable timing of her disclosed trades. Pelosi’s annual salary falls between $174,000 and $197,000 as a senior member of Congress. When she served as Speaker of the House, her annual salary was $223,500. An ETF to track the stock trading activity of Democrats in Congress, the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (BATS:NANC), bears the Representative’s name in the stock ticker. Increased calls to ban Congress members and their spouses from trading have also centered on Pelosi, a Democrat. One bill even uses her name as an acronym: the PELOSI Act.NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares closed at $143.71 on Monday, hitting new all-time highs. Nvidia stock is up 198% year-to-date in 2024.

ERIC KIM Over the past four years, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has outperformed both Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) in terms of stock growth, largely due to its significant exposure to Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of their performance: • MicroStrategy (MSTR): The stock surged 1,067% between 2020 and 2024, driven by its aggressive Bitcoin holdings strategy, which has been the primary factor behind its explosive growth. • Nvidia (NVDA): Over the same period, Nvidia saw a remarkable 1,008% increase, bolstered by its leadership in AI and semiconductor technologies. • Apple (AAPL): Apple, while experiencing steady growth, has seen a much lower percentage increase compared to the others, around 322%, reflecting its more stable, less speculative growth trajectory. MSTR’s growth is more volatile and heavily tied to the cryptocurrency market, while Nvidia’s gains are due to technological advancements in AI, and Apple’s rise is grounded in its dominant position in consumer electronics and services.

Title: The U.S. will keep pressuring allies to restrict chip sales to China, ASML chief says

With U.S. restrictions on investing in artificial intelligence in China expected imminently, the head of a major Dutch chipmaking equipment company said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML (ASML), said most of its business in China is focused “on mainstream semiconductors,” which “is very different from AI,” during the Bloomberg Tech Summit on Tuesday. China has been ASML’s largest market for the last five quarters, with nearly half of the Dutch company’s revenue for the second-quarter coming from sales to the country, Bloomberg reported. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” China-based Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) depend on ASML’s DUV lithography machines to make advanced chips. The country has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment, and China cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make the world’s most advanced chips used by companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Existing U.S. restrictions on China are holding it “10 to 15 years behind when it comes to advanced technology,” Fouquet said. In September, the Netherlands announced new export control rules requiring ASML to apply for export licenses with the Hague instead of with the U.S. to sell some of its equipment to China. Shares of ASML fell 16% last week after it published financial results early that showed a downward revision of guidance for 2025. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” However, Fouquet told Bloomberg he expects both the chip industry and ASML to continue growing next year. “We also expect 2026 to be a growth year,” he said, “but it’s too early to quantify that.” Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in the final review stage for restrictions on outbound U.S. investments in sensitive technologies such as AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing to China, according to a government update. The final rules are expected to be released in the next week or weeks, Reuters reported. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Dow drops 150 points as gold hits a record, and Treasury yields rise

The Dow fell by 165 points on Tuesday morning as gold prices surged to another record high and interest rates continued to climb. Federal Reserve policymakers are considering a more moderate approach to future interest rate cuts, a shift that has dampened investor sentiment. The prospect of slower rate reductions suggests that the Fed remains cautious about balancing inflation control with economic growth, contributing to the broader market’s unease. Shortly after the market opened Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 165 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Spot gold prices have surged past $2,700 an ounce, reaching a new record high of $2,733. This marks a significant milestone for the precious metal, which has gained more than 30% year-to-date, driven by heightened investor demand for safe-haven assets amid ongoing economic uncertainties and tension in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly climbed above 4.2%—its highest level since July—before pulling back slightly. The rise in bond yields reflects concerns over persistent inflation and the potential for further tightening by the Federal Reserve, which has kept pressure on equity markets. Several major companies are reporting earnings on Tuesday, including 3M (MMM), General Motors (GM), GE Aerospace (GE), and Verizon Communications (VZ), all of which drew significant attention from investors. Nvidia (NVDA), which hit another high on Monday, was down 0.6% Tuesday morning, while Tesla (TSLA), which reports earnings on Wednesday, was down 0.8%.

U.S. stock futures are lower as indexes step back from record highs and Treasury yields move higher; General Motors (GM) and GE Aerospace (GE) beat third-quarter earnings estimates; Nvidia (NVDA) is close to eclipsing Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization; and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) shares are rising on a report an activist investor is urging the restaurant chain to break up. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are lower Tuesday, a day after major indexes closed mixed. Coming off a six-week winning streak and record closing highs on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 moved lower on Monday, while the Nasdaq gained ground. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have hit their highest levels since July as investors factor in slower expectations of interest-rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% on Monday, an increase of 11 basis points, to deliver the biggest intraday rise since Oct. 4. Automaker General Motors (GM) beat analysts' expectations with its third-quarter earnings report Tuesday morning. The Cadillac and Chevrolet maker reported revenue of $48.76 billion, better than the consensus estimate of $45.02 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its profit of $3.06 billion topped projections of $2.59 billion. GM also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $10.00 to $10.50, up from the prior guidance of $9.50 to $10.50. Shares of GM are about 1% lower in premarket trading. GE Aerospace (GE) delivered third-quarter earnings that were better than analysts' expectations as the company reported strong demand for its airplane engines and parts. The company's revenue of $9.84 billion was above the projection of $9.55 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its net income of $1.89 billion, or $1.56 per share, topped the projected $1.28 billion and $1.19. The aerospace manufacturer also also lifted its profit projections for full-year 2024, guiding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to a range of $4.20 to $4.35, up from $3.95 to $4.20 previously. Still, shares are declining more than 5% in premarket trading as commercial engines revenue came in a bit short of expectations. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are inching higher in premarket trading after the chipmaker hit another all-time high on Monday of $143.71 as analysts continued to project upward momentum for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Bank of America named Nvidia a "top AI pick" and moved the company's price target to $190 from $165. The rise puts Nvidia's market capitalization around $3.5 trillion as it gains on Apple (AAPL) to become the world's largest corporation. Apple's market capitalization is near $3.6 trillion and its shares are lower by 0.7% in premarket trading. Activist investor JCP Investment Management has taken a position in The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and is urging the company to break up, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Houston-based hedge fund took a 2% stake in Cheesecake Factory, the report said, and is urging executives at the company to spin off restaurant chains North Italia, Flower Child, and Culinary Dropout. Shares of Cheesecake Factory are rising nearly 4% in premarket trading.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Hits Record High on AI Optimism

Shares of AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) are likely remain to remain the spotlight Tuesday after jumping to a new record high yesterday. The stock has nearly tripled since the start of the year, and most analysts believe there's further upside based on the company’s dominance of the AI chip market and insatiable demand for its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha have a consensus price target on the shares of $154.19, up from $152.41 a week ago and representing 7% upside from Monday's closing price of $143.71. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify important price levels that other investors will likely be watching. After reaching a prior peak in mid-June, Nvidia shares traded within a symmetrical triangle before staging a decisive breakout above the pattern earlier this month. It’s also worth pointing out, that although trading volume remains below longer-term averages, the stock logged its highest share turnover last week since late September. From a momentum standpoint, the relative strength index (RSI) indicates bullish price action and gives a reading below overbought levels, suggesting the stock has ample room to move higher. Looking ahead, let’s forecast a price target for the stock’s current uptrend and also locate several important levels on Nvidia’s chart that could attract buying interest during retracements. To speculate where the stock’s current trend higher may be headed, we can use a bars pattern, a technique that studies earlier trends to forecast future directional moves. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we’ll extract the trend higher from April to June and reposition it from the start of the stock’s current move higher in early September. Such a technique indicates a potential upside target of around $180, about 25% above Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior trend as it commenced with a gain of around 15% on the weekly chart, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. During periods of weakness, investors should initially keep their eyes peeled on the $125 level, a location on the chart where the shares may encounter support near the symmetrical triangle pattern’s breakout area. A breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to around $97. Investors may view this region as a buying opportunity, given its proximity to the March peak and 50-week moving average. Finally, a bearish reversal in the stock may trigger a move down to the $76 level, where bargain hunters would likely look for entry points around the mid-April pullback low.

Title: US Rules Limiting AI Investing in China Imminent

U.S. rules that will limit some American investing into sensitive technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) in China are imminent, with a U.S. government update in the last review stage. The final rules will be released in the "next week or so" following an Office of Management and Budget review, Reuters said. The rules follow an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023 limiting U.S. investing in China that could strengthen the Asian nation's military while weakening American national security. According to that order, the U.S. Department of the Treasury was considering barring investing into China's quantum information technologies and some advanced technologies like "semiconductors and microelectronics," and requiring notification for investment into AI. The proposals were put forward for public feedback last year. The U.S. imposed export controls on advanced semiconductor chips aimed at curbing China's access last year. Such curbs have already made it harder for American firms like Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) to sell AI chips to China.

Amid the start of rate cuts — and economic data that's showed the US economy remains in better shape than initially feared — the recent push to new record highs has largely been about companies not named Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), or Nvidia (NVDA). But the debate over whether the market's next leg higher will be led by just a few large tech companies — as was the case in 2023 and the early part of 2024 — continues to roll on among investors. In a note on Friday, data from FactSet showed that earnings for the 493 companies in the S&P 500 outside the "Magnificent Seven" are expected to grow by an average of more than 13% over the next five quarters. Conversely, the Magnificent Seven are expected to see earnings grow by an average of nearly 19% over the same time period. Notably, this represents a pickup in growth for the 493 from 2024 and a notch lower for the Magnificent Seven. This more positive trend in the 493 is one of the reasons strategists have called for a continued broadening out of the rally. But as our chart below shows, the difference in trend growth is a narrowing race. And some believe Big Tech could still be the winner. "The Mag 7 are still expected to post superior (and presumably more reliable) earnings growth than the rest of the index," DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said. Colas noted that this data suggests tech "should begin to play catchup into the end of the year," as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and throughout 2024. "Going forward, the path to outperformance will be assessing whether Big Tech or the rest of the S&P 500 will exhibit better earnings momentum," Colas wrote. "If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet. Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech." Part of the tech revival may already be playing out. Nvidia has soared to a fresh record high over the past month, its first since June. Apple stock closed at a record high of $235 per share on Friday and added to those gains on Monday. Netflix (NFLX), the first of the large tech giants to report earnings, saw a massive rally in its stock to a fresh record high after another impressive round of earnings. That move in the streaming giant is perhaps the most illuminating when considering the case for Big Tech to lead the market. Even Netflix, which had already seen its stock rise more than 50% on the year before earnings, managed to surprise Wall Street to the upside. Perhaps this serves as an early reminder that while growth in tech is "expected" to slow from its rapid pace over the past year, that doesn't mean there can't be upside surprises — or that it still can't outperform. You don't need to look beyond the past 18 months of many tech earnings reports coming in better than expected for the empirical evidence. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Head of World’s Largest Sovereign Wealth Fund Sees a Problem With the A.I. Hype

Nicolai Tangen is no stranger to mass amounts of wealth—he oversees around $2 trillion in assets as CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. But even Tangen is unsure about the sheer scale of the ongoing A.I. stock rally. “It means that there is a risk in the stock market which we have never seen before,” he said during an episode of the Financial Times’ Unhedged podcast last week.

You can opt out anytime. Norway’s wealth fund, initially established to invest the nation’s oil revenue, owns nearly 1.5 percent of all shares in the world’s publicly traded companies and is allowed to spend up to 3 percent of its holdings annually. Many of these investments are in the tech sector, with the fund holding around a 1 percent stake in Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). The fund’s investments in these companies, combined with its stakes in Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), total at around $174 billion. While Tangen’s fund might be a major investor in companies at the forefront of A.I., that doesn’t mean he isn’t concerned about them. Warning that “we are heading for a period of low returns,” the former hedge fund manager who founded the London-based AKO Capital pointed to the dominance of A.I.-focused companies in the market as cause for concern. “The leadership in the market is very narrow, always focusing on companies with some kind of A.I. connection,” he told Unhedged, noting that the ten largest companies in the U.S. now account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. S&P 500 Index in terms of market value. An A.I. revolution ushered in by the 2022 unveiling of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot has been an unprecedented boon for Big Tech. Demand for the new technology propelled the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft above $3 trillion market caps and pushed other tech companies to the top of the stock market, leading some to fret that an A.I. crash could have devastating financial impacts. This concentration “is absolutely worrying,” said Tangen, who noted the interconnectedness between the A.I. leaders at the top as another alarming development. The Dutch company ASML makes machines to produce computer chips, used by the likes of Nvidia, which subsequently sells its A.I. accelerators to the likes of Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, he said. “There are very few companies tied into them, and they are getting bigger and bigger and more and more important,” he said. The majority of these companies notably stem from America. Europe’s lack of major tech companies, meanwhile, is a factor Tangen doesn’t believe will change anytime soon. “In America, you have lots of A.I. and little regulation, and in Europe you have little A.I. and lots of regulation.” The European Union’s A.I. Act, for example, has emerged as one of the broadest efforts to regulate the technology. Going forward, Tangen is particularly concerned about the vulnerability of A.I. when it comes to geopolitical risks. “The main thing to watch is the relationship between the U.S. and China,” said the wealth manager, noting the potential implications a disturbance in this relationship could have on America’s reliance on Taiwan and its chip supply chains. Such chips play an outsized role in everyday life, from “phones, toasters, cars, dishwashers. Just everything,” he said. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Housing Stocks Fall as Rate-Cut Outlook Softens

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed to start the new trading week as earnings season intensifies. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told a town hall that he expects interest-rate cuts to proceed moderately over the next few quarters. However, he indicated that unexpected weakness in the labor market could prompt more rapid rate reductions. The prospect of rates remaining elevated for longer contributed to an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Monday. The Dow tumbled 0.8%, ending a three-day winning streak for the blue-chip index. After trading in negative territory for most of the session, the Nasdaq recovered in the afternoon to close with a daily gain of 0.3%. Concerns about the pace of interest-rate reductions weighed on stocks in the housing sector, with the likelihood of mortgage rates staying high dampening the outlook for real estate. Shares of construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) tumbled 5.2%, making the steepest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Shares of homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) were down 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively, while numerous real estate investment trusts (REITs) also lost ground. Cigna (CI) shares fell 4.7% following reports about a resumption of merger negotiations with rival health insurer Humana (HUM). The two companies engaged in talks last year but failed to strike a deal, but according to Bloomberg, they are in the early stages of a new round of negotiations. Cigna announced in January that it plans to sell its Medicare Advantage business to Health Care Service Corporation, suggesting that the divestment could make a potential merger with Humana more palatable to regulators. Humana shares slipped 2.5% on Monday. Shares of Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), a semiconductor maker specializing in power management solutions, lost 3.6%. Recent reports indicated that Monolithic Power insiders unloaded more than $300 million worth in shares of the company. Investors often interpret insider sales as a sign of limited confidence in a firm's future performance. Monday's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer health company that completed its separation from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in August, which surged 5.5%. The gains followed multiple reports that activist investor Starboard Value had accumulated a significant position in Kenvue, home to well-known brands like Benadryl and Band-Aid. According to The Wall Street Journal, the hedge fund aims to push for changes to help boost Kenvue's stock price. Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) added 4.1% in the wake of positive commentary from several Wall Street analysts. Bank of America and investment research firm CFRA boosted their price targets on Nvidia stock last week. Analysts at Bank of America highlighted Nvidia's partnerships with companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN), solidifying Nvidia's position as a go-to collaborator in the enterprise AI space. Boeing (BA) shares jumped 3.1% after the company reached a tentative deal with the union representing its machinists, potentially ending a strike that has persisted for five weeks and constrained the aircraft maker's operations. According to a statement released over the weekend, the union plans to vote Wednesday on the new deal, which includes a 35% increase in wages over four years—a step up from Boeing's prior offers but still below the union's stated goal of 40%.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares surged Monday to close at a fresh high, just a week after the company set its previous record. The chipmaker's stock price gained more than 4% to finish at $143.71 Monday, and has nearly tripled in value this year as demand boomed for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the stock's meteoric rise, most analysts believe the stock still has further to climb. All but one of the 22 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha had a "buy" or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $154.19, up from $152.41 a week ago and implying over 7% upside from Monday's closing price. Late last week, Bank of America analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia even higher to $190 from $165, calling it a “top AI pick.” The analysts pointed to recent comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who said that demand for the company's Blackwell AI chips is “insane” in an interview with CNBC earlier this month.

Nvidia (NVDA) closed at a record high Monday as Wall Street anticipates Big Tech’s earnings report in November. The chipmaker’s stock rose 4.14% and closed at $143.71 per share, and its shares continued climbing in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, the company’s stock reached an intraday record high of $142.46, according to Barron’s. Nvidia’s shares are up 198.34% so far this year. Friday, Bank of America (BAC) raised its price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165, citing “confidence in NVDA’s competitive lead and generational opportunity.” Research analyst Vivek Arya cited “recent industry events,” including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) (TSM) earnings results and Advanced Micro Devices’ AI event, as part of the reason for the price target lift in the Bank of America Global Research report last week. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,” Arya said. Last week, Nvidia set an intraday high after TSMC beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock briefly climbed over 3% to set an intraday record of $140.89 per share Thursday. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Meanwhile, TSMC reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell over 4% last Tuesday after closing at a record high $138.07 the previous day. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries.

Whether records keep rolling in rides in large part on corporate results in the coming days. Earnings season ramps up this week, as over 100 S&P 500 companies are lined up to report. So far, 80% of third quarter updates from those on the benchmark have topped the mark. Investors are on edge for Tesla's (TSLA) report on Wednesday, after its robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. The EV maker is the highlight of the week amid questions about Big Tech performance, even after Netflix's (NFLX) strong kickoff to the megacap season. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big hitters on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) faces a double-whammy on Wednesday, when it's expected to release earnings at the same time workers vote on whether to accept a tentative deal agreed with the union to end a five-week strike.

Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) also rose to a record high during Monday's session. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: A wild weekend on the campaign trail underlined two key trends of the 2024 campaign cash race: Kamala's Harris's outsized fundraising prowess and Donald Trump's reliance on an array of friendly billionaires. Vice President Harris's campaign out-raised Trump by over 3 to 1 in September to cap off a less than three-month sprint as a candidate that saw her raise an unprecedented $1 billion. Trump's own formal operation has lagged behind. But the former president and his allies have tried to make up the difference with their own flood of billionaire donations directed to outside groups supporting his candidacy. Read more here. Dan Howley reports: The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often. Qualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web. On Monday, Qualcomm shares were down almost 2%. Read more here. An early trend is emerging through the first part of quarterly earnings reports. For the first time since 2020, companies that beat Wall Street's expectations on both revenue and earnings are seeing larger stock moves than companies that miss on both metrics. Through earnings from 71 companies in the S&P 500, companies that beat expectations on both metrics are seeing an average stock gain of 3.15% over the next day, above the 1.49% average seen since 2000, per research from Bank of America. Meanwhile, companies that miss on revenue and earnings estimates are seeing a 2.61% decline in their stock the next day, below the average since 2000 of 2.44%. "As large-cap Tech earnings near, the potential for large earnings reactions to continue strengthens the case for owning Tech vol through the end of October," Bank of America Securities team of strategists wrote in a note on Monday morning. Morgan Stanley chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson opined on the topic in a note to clients on Sunday night as well. "Bottom line, dispersion between stocks and even within sectors is likely to remain high as the market appears to be delineating clearly between earnings beats and misses," Wilson wrote. Pras Subramanian reports: Investors are expecting more upbeat results from GM (GM) when the automaker reports earnings on Tuesday after the company raised its guidance for a second time earlier this year on the back of decent US sales. Questions around GM’s EV business and inventory management, however, will be in focus. For the third quarter, GM is expected to report revenue of $44.69 billion per Bloomberg consensus, sequentially lower than last quarter’s nearly $48 billion, but to be expected given the second quarter’s historically strong sales. GM’s Q3 revenue is expected to be higher than a year ago. Read more here. Netflix (NFLX) shares hit all-time highs on Monday, extending gains from last week when the streaming giant posted a better-than-expected quarterly print. The stock briefly touched a new high of $773 during the session before paring gains. Gold and silver gains show no sign of slowing down as investors continue to pour into precious metals. Gold futures (CG=F) rose 0.8% on Monday to touch an intraday high above $2,750 per ounce. Silver futures (SI=F) gained more than 3% to briefly top $34 per ounce, a 12-year high. Both metals have outperformed the broader markets. Gold bullion is up roughly 26% and silver has risen nearly 35% since the start of 2024, compared with the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 19%. Central banks have been buying up the yellow metal, and investors have been increasingly entering physically backed gold ETFs amid expectations of lower interest rates. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Disney (DIS) plans to announce its next CEO in early 2026, the first timeline the company has publicly given for appointing a successor to current chief Bob Iger. The media giant made the announcement on Monday while simultaneously revealing that current board member and former Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman will serve as the board's new chairman, effective Jan. 2, 2025. He will exit his role as executive chairman at Morgan Stanley on Dec. 31. “A critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026," Gorman said in a press release. "This timing reflects the progress the Succession Planning Committee and the Board are making, and will allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger’s contract in December 2026." Read more here. Apple's (AAPL) stock was on pace to eke out a new high on Monday after closing at a record on Friday. Shares of the iPhone maker rose slightly to hover near $235.80 each. On Friday, the stock closed at a record $235. Year to date, Apple is up more than 22%. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan reiterated on Monday that she sees policymakers lowering interest rates "gradually". She cited an increased risk that the job market could worsen and a danger that inflation could still heat up again. "If the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals," Logan said in a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual meeting in New York. Logan said the economy is "strong and stable" but that "meaningful uncertainties" remain in the outlook. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) stock climbed more than 1.5% early on Monday, helping mitigate a bigger decline in the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). Shares of the AI chip heavyweight rose to hover above $140 each, briefly touching an intraday high of $141. The Nasdaq was trading near the flat line as Nvidia rose. The major averages opened slightly lower on Monday as investors awaited a fresh batch of earnings this week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.2%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged 0.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.2%. A fresh batch of quarterly results will roll in this week, including from Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big names on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) stock jumped as much as 4.5% in Monday's premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who have been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract on Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the plane maker to report a loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying shares, while 11 have a Hold rating, and three say to sell. On average, analysts see Boeing shares rising to about $192 each over the next 12 months, implying a more than 20% gain.

Title: Wall Street keeps raising price targets for sky-high Nvidia stock. Here's why analysts are still so bullish.

Nvidia stock is trading at record highs, but that's not deterring top Wall Street analysts from being bullish. Bank analysts have been hiking their price targets for the chip titan in recent weeks, predicting more upside even as the stock has seen a meteoric rise over the past year. Shares traded above $142 each on Monday, hitting a fresh record as investors gear up for the company's next earnings report on November 20. The stock is up 193% year-to-date. But Nvidia still has plenty of room to climb, according to forecasters. They point to signs of frenzied demand for the company's AI-enabling GPU chips and a long list of partnerships with enterprise "hyperscalers." Here's what some of Wall Street's top forecasters are saying about their bullish outlook for the stock. BofA strategists raised their price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165 per share last week, implying another 35% upside from the stock's current levels. The upside will be driven by Nvidia's competitive advantage over other chipmakers, as well as the "generational opportunity" in the AI market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion, analysts said in a note. "Driven by our increased NVDA Data Center Compute outlook, we now see the AI accelerator market growing to $280bn by CY27E (and over time toward $400bn+) from just ~$45bn in CY23. AI models (demand) continue to evolve," the bank added. Strategists pointed to positive signs for Nvidia's future chip demand, including commentary from other tech firms and comments from CEO Jensen Huang, who described the demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip as "insane." Nvidia, meanwhile, also has a number of "underappreciated" business partnerships with firms like Accenture and Microsoft, which should contribute to the upside potential. "We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice," the bank said. "NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side." Goldman analysts raised their price target to $150 from $135 a share, implying 6% upside from the stock's current levels. Strategists said they changed their price target after a meeting with Huang. The Nvidia CEO spoke of the company's advantage over other chipmakers, and the bank said that Nvidia's "competitive moat" is built on the firm's installed base, its innovation, and its "robust and growing" software offerings. "Although we acknowledge that the company's revenue trajectory beyond CY2025 remains uncertain, we expect the stock to perform at least consistent with estimate revisions given relative valuation multiples that remain depressed relative to history ... and the potential for a re-acceleration in fundamentals driven by the upcoming Blackwell product cycle," strategists wrote. Blackwell could also help produce several billion dollars in revenue for Nvidia, the strategists estimated. "By integrating seven chips, and each playing a role in delivering higher performance at the data center level, we view the introduction and ramp of Blackwell not only as a near- and medium-term revenue growth driver, but also a dynamic that extends Nvidia's competitive advantage. The ramp of Blackwell-based products remains on track with several billion dollars in revenue expected in the January quarter followed by further growth in April and beyond." The research firm CFRA raised its price target to $160 from $139 per share, implying a 13% upside from current levels. According to Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA, that's due to increased confidence that Nvidia will post better-than-expected growth, particularly as customers scramble to get their hands on the new Blackwell chip. "The higher multiple and target reflect our higher conviction that NVDA will post results that exceed our/consensus views in CY 25, as Blackwell ramps. As we previously cited, Blackwell will take greater wallet share from hyperscalers (e.g., greater GPU, CPU, networking, and software revenue) amid an AI war in the cloud," Zino wrote. Bernstein raised its price target to $155 a share shortly after the chipmaker reported its second-quarter earnings in August. Similar to other firms' forecasts, Bernstein's upside prediction is based on the success of the Blackwell GPU. "People are getting excited about the story again, especially as we approach earnings, and then year-end into next year is their new platform, Blackwell, really starts to ramp. Look, by all indications, their own commentary, all the supply checks and everything else, demand for this product just looks off the charts," Rasgon said in an interview with CNBC in early October. "This cycle, if the checks are any indication, must potentially be massive," he added. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Nvidia stock soars to fresh record as Wall Street stays bullish ahead of earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed at a record high on Monday as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish positions on the stock ahead of its earnings report in November. Shares of the leading AI chipmaker rose over 4% to close at $143.71 per share. The move comes as Wall Street analysts reiterate their Buy ratings on the stock. Citing strong demand for artificial intelligence, Bank of America (BAC) on Friday raised its price target from $165 to $190 (go inside the call with analyst Vivek Arya below from the Opening Bid podcast), while investment research firm CFRA raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. In addition to growth in the AI market at large, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said Nvidia’s strength in the enterprise AI space — i.e., its partnerships with companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN) — is another factor contributing to his higher price target. Arya said “NVDA is the partner of choice” for enterprise AI hardware and software. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives echoed that sentiment in a note to investors Sunday, writing that there is “a tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode,” with Nvidia leading the market. Ives forecasts the AI infrastructure market to grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies spending $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in that time frame. “In a nutshell, we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to see another 20% move higher in 2025 with this tech bull market just hitting its next phase led by the AI Revolution,” Ives added. “In our opinion as the Fed and Powell have kicked off its aggressive rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector.” Despite a short-lived tumble last week and looming fears of an AI spending slowdown, Nvidia shares have risen nearly 3% over the past week and more than 20% in the last month. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said there is “insane” demand for its AI chips, which are used in data centers by Big Tech companies to power generative artificial intelligence software. Recent positive news from the company's industry partners has also boosted AI stocks across the board, including Nvidia. Micron (MU), which supplies memory chips used in Nvidia’s GPUs, and TSMC (TSM), which manufactures Nvidia’s AI chips, both surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in their recent earnings reports. The AI chip market is expected to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% in 2025, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Still, there's a chance that even the slightest slowdown in Nvidia's growth could send the stock lower, as investors proved difficult to please during Big Tech's last wave of quarterly reports. Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect Nvidia to report third quarter earnings per share of $0.74, an 84% increase from last year. They see revenue rising 83% to $33.1 billion. Some 67 analysts have Outperform ratings on Nvidia stock, while seven maintain a Hold rating, and only one recommends selling shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Wave Goodbye To the Stock Market's Historic Run, Goldman Sachs Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/wave-goodbye-to-the-stock-market-s-historic-run-goldman-sachs-says-8731471

The S&P 500 is on a record run this year, posting its strongest year-to-date performance since 1997. But, as analysts at Goldman Sachs argued in a note on Monday, all good things must come to an end. Goldman analysts forecast the S&P 500 will return an average of just 3% a year in the next decade, a far cry from the 13% average annual return of the last 10 years. That would rank in the bottom decile of comparable periods in the last century. It also puts the odds that stocks fail to outpace inflation at about 33%. Goldman's forecast is far below the consensus on Wall Street. According to its analysis of the publicly available capital markets assumptions of 21 asset managers, other 10-year forecasts for S&P 500 performance range from a low of 4.4% to a high of 7.4%, with the average being 6%. So why the pessimism? One of the primary causes for Goldman's concern is the market’s extreme concentration, which by their measure is near its highest level in 100 years. Concentration of this magnitude, the analysts say, makes the performance of the S&P 500 overly reliant on the earnings growth of the index's largest constituents. The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 currently account for about 36% of the index, far higher than at any other time in the last 40 years. These stocks have swelled in size in large part because of their exceptional earnings growth over the last two years. The Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—more than doubled their earnings on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2024. History shows, however, that it's extremely difficult to sustain earnings growth at that clip. Just 11% of S&P 500 companies since 1980 have maintained double-digit sales growth for 10+ years, according to a Goldman analysis. A microscopic share (0.1%) has sustained 50%+ margins for a decade. "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," the analysts write. The Magnificent Seven's earnings growth already has begun to decline from its meteoric pace of the last two years. The group's profit growth is expected to decline to just over 18% in the third quarter as year-over-year comparisons become more difficult. However, growth is expected to pick up for the "Other 493," which are forecast to post double-digit earnings growth over the next five quarters, significantly narrowing the gap between those companies and the Mag Seven. The market's extreme concentration and the difficulty of sustaining earnings growth are two key reasons Goldman expects the equal-weight S&P 500 index to outperform the more widely tracked capitalization-weight, or aggregate, version over the next decade. Historically, the equal-weight index tends to outperform the aggregate index, but the last 10 years have been a different story. The aggregate index has outperformed the equal-weight by 3 percentage points a year since 2014. Goldman expects the pendulum to swing back in favor of the equal-weight index, which their model suggests will outperform by 8 percentage points annually through 2034, its most dramatic outperformance since at least 1980. The size of the outperformance may seem extreme, the analysts note. "However, the equity market has also rarely been as concentrated as it is now." The current record outperformance for the equal-weight index is 7%, which it achieved in the decades ending in 1983 and 2010. These two 10-year stretches, Goldman points out, each began when the market was at peak concentration, as it may be today.

Title: Stock market today: Dow slips as S&P 500, Nasdaq wobble with flood of earnings ahead

Stocks wobbled on Monday as investors braced for a packed week of top-tier earnings that could drive or drag on a record-setting rally. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped almost 0.1%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high and a sixth weekly win in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged almost 0.2% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) hovered near the flatline as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) hovered near new highs. Whether records keep rolling in rides in large part on corporate results in the coming days. Earnings season ramps up this week, as over 100 S&P 500 companies are lined up to report. So far, 80% of third quarter updates from those on the benchmark have topped the mark. Investors are on edge for Tesla's (TSLA) report on Wednesday, after its robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. The EV maker is the highlight of the week amid questions about Big Tech performance, even after Netflix's (NFLX) strong kickoff to the megacap season. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big hitters on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) faces a double-whammy on Wednesday, when it's expected to release earnings at the same time workers vote on whether to accept a tentative deal agreed with the union to end a five-week strike. Shares of the plane maker rose over 3% in early Monday trading. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbed over 6 basis points to 4.136%, the highest level since the end of July. Oil prices rose as much as 2% alongside gains for Chinese stocks (000300.SS) as China's stimulus push continued with a cut to key lending rates. Global benchmark Brent futures (BZ=F) traded near $74 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude futures topped $70, with Israel's next Iran move also in focus. Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 1.5% on Monday, helping mitigate a bigger decline in the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC). Shares of the AI chip heavy weight rose to hover above $140 each, briefly touching an intraday high of $141. The Nasdaq was trading near the flatline as Nvidia rose. The major averages opened slightly lower on Monday as investors await a fresh batch of earnings this weeek. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.2%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged 0.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) shed 0.2%. A fresh batch of quarterly results will roll in this week including Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday, General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big names on the earnings docket this week. Boeing stock jumped as much as 4.5% Monday premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who've been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the company to report an earnings loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing this year has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year.
