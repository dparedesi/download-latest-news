Title: Market Implications Of Tariff Litigation And AI Spending

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial ... More sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. Market volatility and recent trade developments have created distinct opportunities across multiple sectors, from artificial intelligence powerhouses to healthcare giants navigating regulatory changes. Savvy investors are recognizing that current market dislocations often mask underlying business strength, particularly among companies with proven track records of innovation, market leadership and adaptability to changing economic conditions. This analysis identifies five compelling investment opportunities spanning technology, healthcare, industrials and data analytics sectors. Each selection represents companies well-positioned to benefit from long-term secular trends, trading at levels that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors with suitable time horizons and risk tolerance. The selection process emphasized companies demonstrating strong competitive moats, consistent revenue growth and clear catalysts for future expansion. Priority was given to market leaders within their respective industries, particularly those benefiting from transformative trends such as the adoption of artificial intelligence, healthcare innovation, industrial automation, and data-driven decision-making across enterprise markets. Each company needed to show resilient business models capable of generating sustainable cash flows while investing in growth initiatives. Special consideration was given to management teams with proven execution capabilities, strong balance sheets that provide strategic flexibility and business models positioned to benefit from ongoing technological and demographic shifts reshaping the global economy. Honeywell International stands as a premier diversified technology and manufacturing company, operating across aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and safety solutions. The company has successfully transformed itself into a software-enabled industrial leader, developing connected solutions that address critical challenges in automation, energy efficiency and digital transformation. Recent strategic initiatives focus on sustainable technologies, including renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions and next-generation automation systems. The company's diversified portfolio provides natural hedging against industry-specific downturns while positioning it to benefit from multiple long-term growth drivers. Honeywell's aerospace division serves both commercial and defense markets. At the same time, its building technologies segment capitalizes on increasing demand for innovative building solutions and energy management systems that reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Honeywell represents exceptional value in the industrial technology space, combining steady dividend income with significant growth potential from emerging technologies. The company's transformation toward higher-margin software and services has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Operating margins have expanded to over 20%, with return on invested capital consistently above 15%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation and strong pricing power. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple business segments as commercial aviation continues normalizing and defense spending remains robust globally. Honeywell’s Aerospace division contributed nearly 40% of total revenue in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow further as backlogs normalize and global air travel rebounds. The Building Technologies division positions Honeywell perfectly for the ongoing shift toward smart infrastructure and energy-efficient solutions, particularly as regulatory requirements drive the adoption of automated building management systems. This segment also supports a recurring revenue model through service contracts and software subscriptions, contributing to earnings stability. Management's consistent operational execution, combined with strategic investments in breakthrough technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and quantum computing applications, creates multiple pathways for long-term value creation while maintaining attractive current income through reliable dividend payments. With a payout ratio under 50% and consistent dividend increases, Honeywell remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation. NVIDIA Corporation has emerged as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence computing, providing the essential hardware and software infrastructure powering the global AI revolution. The company's graphics processing units form the foundation for machine learning, data center acceleration, autonomous vehicle development and scientific computing applications across virtually every industry. Recent strategic partnerships, including collaborations with major technology companies and governments, demonstrate the critical nature of NVIDIA's technology in next-generation computing applications. The company's comprehensive AI platform extends beyond hardware to encompass software frameworks, development tools and cloud services, fostering long-term customer relationships and generating recurring revenue streams. NVIDIA's data center business has become the primary driver of growth. At the same time, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive segments provide diversification and additional expansion opportunities as AI capabilities are integrated across more applications. NVIDIA occupies a virtually unassailable position in one of the most transformative technology trends of this generation, with artificial intelligence adoption still in its early stages across most industries. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Saudi Arabia on AI initiatives, demonstrate the global strategic importance of NVIDIA's technology and provide new revenue opportunities in emerging markets seeking to build AI capabilities. The company's technological moat continues widening as competitors struggle to match NVIDIA's integrated hardware-software approach and extensive developer ecosystem. Gross margins remain strong, above 70%, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing in a high-demand market. While the stock trades at premium valuations, the massive addressable market for AI computing, combined with NVIDIA's dominant market share and accelerating adoption rates across enterprise and government sectors, justifies higher multiples. The company's ability to maintain pricing power while scaling production positions it for sustained revenue and margin expansion as AI infrastructure investments accelerate globally. UnitedHealth Group operates as America's largest healthcare company, serving over 50 million members through its UnitedHealthcare insurance business while providing comprehensive health services through its rapidly growing Optum division. The company has built an integrated healthcare ecosystem that combines insurance, pharmacy benefits, medical care delivery and health technology solutions, improving patient outcomes while reducing overall system costs. Despite recent stock volatility related to regulatory concerns, UnitedHealth's fundamental business model remains strong, benefiting from aging demographics, increasing healthcare utilization and the ongoing shift toward value-based care arrangements. The Optum division has become a significant growth driver, providing technology-enabled services that help healthcare providers improve efficiency and patient care quality. UnitedHealth's current valuation appears compelling given its dominant market position and multiple growth drivers across both insurance and services businesses. The recent regulatory-driven volatility, exacerbated by a high-profile fraud lawsuit, has led to a steep selloff, pushing the stock down significantly and compressing its valuation to a forward P/E of just 12. For a company with UnitedHealth’s scale, diversified revenue streams and consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past decade, this represents a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a deep discount. The company's integrated model provides competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Healthcare spending continues growing faster than GDP, driven by demographic trends and medical innovation, creating a favorable operating environment. The company's investment in technology and data analytics capabilities positions it well for the ongoing transformation toward personalized medicine and value-based care delivery models. Optum's expansion into new markets and services provides significant revenue diversification beyond traditional insurance operations, while the company's strong balance sheet enables continued strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. The combination of defensive healthcare exposure and growth potential makes UnitedHealth attractive despite near-term legal and regulatory headwinds. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare companies, combining leading pharmaceutical research with innovative medical devices and trusted consumer health products. The company's pharmaceutical division develops breakthrough treatments for cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions, while its medical device business serves the global surgical, orthopedic, and vision care markets. The company has demonstrated remarkable consistency over decades, generating steady cash flows that support continuous research investment and regular dividend increases spanning over 60 years. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding oncology and immunology portfolios through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, while divesting non-core consumer brands to focus on higher-growth healthcare segments with stronger competitive positioning. Johnson & Johnson offers exceptional stability combined with growth potential from its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and medical device innovations. The company's diversified revenue streams provide resilience during economic uncertainty. At the same time, its strong research capabilities and established regulatory relationships enable the successful development of breakthrough treatments that command premium pricing and market share. The pharmaceutical division's focus on high-value therapeutic areas, such as oncology and immunology, aligns with some of healthcare's fastest-growing segments—meanwhile, the medical device business benefits from aging demographics and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Management's disciplined capital allocation, combined with the company's AAA credit rating and commitment to dividend growth, makes Johnson & Johnson particularly attractive for conservative investors seeking reliable income growth, capital preservation and upside potential from medical innovation. Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics platforms that enable organizations to integrate, analyze and act upon massive datasets for critical decision-making. The company serves both government and commercial clients through its Gotham platform for defense and intelligence applications and Foundry platform for enterprise customers across industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and financial services. The company's software enables customers to uncover hidden patterns in complex data, optimize operations and make data-driven decisions that were previously impossible due to technological limitations. Recent commercial expansion has accelerated as enterprises recognize the competitive advantages provided by advanced analytics capabilities. At the same time, government contracts continue providing a stable revenue foundation and development funding for cutting-edge capabilities. Palantir operates at the intersection of several powerful trends, including the adoption of artificial intelligence, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making across both government and enterprise markets. The stock's strong 2025 performance reflects growing recognition of the company's unique capabilities and expanding market opportunities as organizations prioritize analytics investments to maintain competitive advantages. The company's government relationships provide both revenue stability and access to cutting-edge use cases that drive product development, while commercial market expansion offers significant scalability potential. Palantir's software platforms create high switching costs once implemented, leading to strong customer retention and expanding usage over time. The increasing importance of data analytics across all industries, combined with Palantir's proven ability to handle complex, mission-critical applications, positions the company for sustained growth as digital transformation accelerates across both public and private sectors. Bottom Line These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. From NVIDIA's AI dominance to Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability, UnitedHealth's integrated model and ultra cheap valuation due to regulatory risks, Honeywell's industrial innovation, and Palantir's data analytics leadership, investors gain exposure to multiple growth drivers while balancing risk across different market segments and business models.

Title: Nvidia can't be stopped, Apple falls behind, and the AI data center race: Tech news roundup

2 / 11 When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. Read More 3 / 11 The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. Read More 4 / 11 Nvidia (NVDA) continues to go beyond expectations — even if things are a little more complicated this time around. Its strong first-quarter headline numbers show that Nvidia’s AI thesis is as strong as ever and that its margins remain elite, despite facing significant headwinds due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 processors to China and other geopolitical concerns. Read More 5 / 11 A new study from Google Researchers is raising questions about whether quantum computing will hamper your ability to keep your crypto wallet secure. Google’s (GOOGL) Craig Gidney, a quantum research scientist, and Sophie Schmieg, a senior staff cryptography engineer, published a blog post on Friday showing a quantum computer could potentially break RSA encryption — the public-key encryption algorithm used to secure data such as for cryptocurrencies — with 20 times fewer quantum resources than they previously believed. Read More 6 / 11 Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei has issued a stark warning: Artificial intelligence could eliminate up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, pushing U.S. unemployment to 10–20% within the next one to five years. Read More 7 / 11 Nvidia’s (NVDA) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Read More 8 / 11 Salesforce said Tuesday it will acquire the cloud data management company Informatica for $8 billion in equity value as it seeks to further compete in the global artificial intelligence race. Read More 9 / 11 Most companies can’t shrug off an $8 billion loss. Then again, most companies aren’t Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter.

Title: BI Investor of the Month: Meet the fund manager up 28% over the last year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-investor-of-the-month-fund-manager-returning-28-over-last-year-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-31T08:46:01Z
Full Content:
Ankur Crawford, manager of the Alger Concentrated Equity ETF (CNEQ), is BI's Investor of the Month for May. Crawford's growth fund launched in April 2024 and has burst onto the scene. Over the last 12 months, it's up 30%, which was good enough to beat 96% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. The S&P 500, by comparison, has returned 12% in that time. In May alone, CNEQ rose 17%. Crawford said the fund, which has 30 holdings, focuses on finding companies with little to no competition and, therefore, the ability to keep prices and profits high. "I would say 50% of the company would liken itself to being an oligopoly or a monopoly," she said. "A great example of that is we own Ferrari. There's only one Ferrari, and they can raise prices however much they want; they are still sold out for three years." Thematically, Crawford said the fund is betting big on artificial intelligence, which she called "one of the biggest opportunities that we see, probably of our generation." Despite sparking a market frenzy since late 2022, the AI trade is still in its early days, she said, and likely has legs for another 5-10 years. "It is a game-changing technology that is still in its infancy," she said. "What it will do to companies that furnish it and companies that are part of building out the infrastructure is significant." The top holdings in CNEQ reflect Crawford's affinity for AI: Nvidia (NVDA) has a 13.18% weighting, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at 10.06%, Amazon (AMZN) at 9.27%, and Meta Platforms (META) at 6.1%. Crawford highlighted two companies in particular as leading the AI trade going forward, and that also fit her preference for monopoly or oligopoly firms: graphic processing unit maker Nvidia and semiconductor producer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). While both have high valuations, they also have pricing power that's just about unmatched. "Being the only player in the world that can do something so important, I would argue TSM is probably the most strategic business on this planet," Crawford said. "That comes with a lot of rewards, including pricing power." Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis. Leveraged funds are not considered. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

Title: Nvidia, Other Chip Stocks Slide Amid Worries About US-China Trade Tensions

Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks slid Friday amid worries about worsening U.S.-China trade tensions. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 4% in recent trading. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) also lost ground, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropping about 3%. Some of Nvidia's partners, including server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), saw their stocks fall as well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) President Trump on Friday said China has "totally violated its agreement with us," dampening hopes the countries would soon come to a longer-term agreement after reaching a temporary truce earlier this month. Separately, Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump plans to expand U.S. companies' licensing requirements to make deals with Chinese companies that have ties to sanctioned firms. The development comes after the Trump administration moved earlier this month to rescind the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that would have further curbed sales of American AI hardware to a broader group of countries, but warned it's looking to replace the rule with new restrictions. Analysts at Citi and Deutsche Bank warned at the time that they could turn out to be stricter than Biden's. During Nvidia's earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said it's "terrific" that Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule, but criticized the administration's other moves to limit its sales to China, saying that "shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position." The AI chipmaker took a $4.5 billion charge in its fiscal first quarter associated with new export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China, and said it expects to take an $8 billion hit in the current quarter due to lost revenue.

Title: Nvidia's China problem is big. Just not big enough to stop it

Time Published: 2025-05-29T17:21:00Z

Most companies can’t shrug off an $8 billion loss. Then again, most companies aren’t Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter. That $8 billion is more than rival AMD’s (AMD) total quarterly revenue — and Nvidia seems ready to just shrug off the loss The tech giant reported another monster quarter: Revenue soared 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, while net income grew even faster. The stock popped more than 4.5% on Thursday, and Nvidia, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, is the most valuable company in the world — just ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) and now well ahead of Apple (AAPL). Nvidia’s data center business alone grew 73% year-over-year and brought in over $39 billion. And with its next-generation Blackwell chips ramping up, inference workloads scaling globally, and governments racing to build AI capacity using Nvidia infrastructure, China has become — if not an afterthought — then certainly just one node in a much larger empire. Nvidia has bigger chips to fry. “This is the start of a powerful new wave of growth,” CEO Jensen Huang said. Still, Nvidia isn’t abandoning China. According to a recent report, the company is designing a modified Blackwell AI chip specifically for the Chinese market that will comply with U.S. export restrictions. Huang didn’t confirm this directly — he said Nvidia doesn’t “have anything at the moment, but we’re considering it.” He did, however, address the broader implications. The question, he said, isn’t whether China will have AI — “it already does” — but whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Export controls, in his view, should “strengthen U.S. platforms, not drive half of the world’s AI talent to rivals.” Kress made the financial stakes clear: Nvidia expects a “meaningful decrease” in China data center revenue in the second quarter. Losing access to what it believes will be a $50 billion AI accelerator market would, she said, have “a material adverse impact” on the business and benefit rivals in China and beyond. As for the politics, Huang said that President Donald Trump “has a plan, and I respect it.” But the bigger picture is that Nvidia isn’t betting on any single market. It’s betting on a global AI infrastructure boom that’s only just getting started — what Huang called “sovereign AI.” The company’s strategy isn’t about selling to tech firms anymore. Entire countries could soon become Nvidia customers. “Nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and internet,” Huang said. “Sovereign AI is a new growth engine for Nvidia.” “Every nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution, a new industry that produces intelligence and essential infrastructure for every economy,” he added. “Countries are racing to build national AI platforms to elevate their digital capabilities.” Nvidia’s recent moves show how seriously it’s playing this global game. At Computex, Huang announced Taiwan’s first AI factory, a collaboration with Foxconn (HNHPF) and the Taiwanese government. Shortly after, Huang was present as Sweden launched its inaugural national AI infrastructure. But perhaps most notable is Nvidia’s opportunity in the Middle East. Huang was there for Trump’s tour through the region, where the president announced a 500-megawatt AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia and a 5-gigawatt AI campus in the United Arab Emirates. Wedbush Securities analysts called it a “watershed moment” for Big Tech that could be a $1 trillion opportunity. Nvidia is positioned to capitalize on that global wave of AI infrastructure investment. As Huang said, this includes everything from powering cutting-edge training models to overhauling $500 billion of enterprise IT with its AI-ready systems. Add in industrial AI — robotic factories, digital twins, and more — and the company’s footprint keeps expanding. “Just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure,” Huang said. “There are umpteenth AI factories being planned.” Behind all of this is a bigger technological shift — from generative AI to what comes next. “Reasoning AI really busted through,” Huang said, referring to AI agents that can make decisions, use tools, remember, and plan. “Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute.” He added that the demand for AI reasoning is up, and “we would like to serve all of it, and I think we’re on track to serve most of it.” That shift — from model training to full life-cycle AI infrastructure — is fueling demand. Huang said Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is “the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI.” And agentic AI, which takes reasoning a step further by acting autonomously, is making waves, too. “Enterprise AI is ready to take off,” Huang said. “Much more than generative AI, agentic AI is game-changing.” CFO Kress said the transition from generative to agentic AI will “transform every industry, every company, and country.” She said Nvidia envisions AI agents as a “digital workforce capable of handling tasks ranging from customer service to complex decision-making processes.” Huang said that Nvidia is in the “beginning of the build-out” — and that “there should be many, many more announcements in the future.” More AI means more chips. More chips need bigger clusters. Bigger clusters demand faster networking. And Nvidia is scaling every layer of that stack. Huang called Spectrum-X — the company’s AI-optimized Ethernet platform — “a home run,” noting that it added two major cloud providers in the past quarter. The platform can effectively turn $10 billion AI clusters into $14 billion ones through increased efficiency. And NVLink is also becoming foundational to the AI data center — it exceeded $1 billion in the April quarter. Now analysts see networking as a meaningful second leg of Nvidia’s AI infrastructure business. The U.S. export controls don’t appear to be going anywhere, especially as tense — and tech-heavy — trade talks between the U.S. and China continue. But Nvidia seems prepared for what’s ahead. The company just lost billions in China, and that might have been the least interesting thing about its quarter. As Nvidia continues to navigate a geopolitical minefield, it’s not that China doesn’t matter — it’s that everything else now matters more. As Huang said: “We’re off to the races.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia briefly returned to the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies when its stock soared in early trading Thursday following a strong first-quarter earnings report. Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped more than 6% in early trading on Thursday, adding more than $200 billion to the company’s market value and pushing the company's market cap to $3.49 trillion, edging out Microsoft’s (MSFT) $3.41 trillion value. Nvidia stock gave up ground throughout the day, and Microsoft ultimately overtook the AI chip giant in market value by Thursday's close. Nvidia shares reacted on Thursday to a solid quarterly report on Wednesday afternoon. Nvidia reported record revenue in its fiscal first quarter as AI demand remained robust. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to be the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. The three are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia reached that milestone almost exactly a year ago, while Apple first closed at $3 trillion in June 2023 and Microsoft reached $3 trillion in January 2024. All three stocks have been hit to a certain degree by economic and trade uncertainty this year, but only Microsoft and Nvidia have shaken off the worst of it. Nvidia's and Microsoft's stocks are up about 5% and 9%, respectively, since the start of the year. Apple shares, meanwhile, are down about 20%, battered by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on China, where the company assembles the majority of its products, and insistence that it move production to America. Nvidia’s market cap, despite Thursday's gains, remains below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Update—May 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest share price and market value data.

Title: Wolfe Research: “We Think The Pain Trade For NVIDIA Is Higher”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Now that the market has had a few hours to digest NVIDIA's earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, the emerging view is coalescing around a distilled nugget of thought: NVIDIA was able to holistically address investor concerns, but the corresponding euphoria remains capped by the idiosyncratic factors inherent in the earnings report - the consensus estimates for various line items became irrelevant when some analysts chose to incorporate H20-related headwinds, while others did not, rendering the overall beat/miss computation an exercise in futility. Enough? - Nvidia $NVDA Earnings Recap Ultimately this report is a big mess because of mis-matched analyst estimates with the China inventory write-off. Tough to read much into the beats and misses below as a result. No blow ups but not overly bullish either. https://t.co/yFFf61ExcH pic.twitter.com/vpPIa4PAnL — Consensus Media (@ConsensusGurus) May 28, 2025 As a refresher, NVIDIA reported $44.06 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q1'26, beating the consensus estimate of $43.29 billion. Under the hood, however, its AI-critical data center revenue topped off at $39.1 billion, falling short of the $39.22 billion consensus estimate. In Q1, following the Trump administration's decision to impose licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPU, the company incurred $4.5 billion in charges related to inventory write-offs and purchase commitments, which then hammered the GPU giant's gross margin to 61 percent. On an adjusted basis, which often provides a clearer picture by removing one-time inflows and outflows, NVIDIA's gross margin topped off at 71.3 percent vs. the 78.9 percent figure that the company recorded in last year's comparable period. As far as guidance is concerned, NVIDIA now expects to record $45 billion in revenue for Q2, plus or minus 2 percent. The midpoint of this guidance fell short of the consensus estimate of $45.5 billion. Do note that NVIDIA's guidance for Q2 excluded ~$8 billion in H20-related sales. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Wolfe Research has now penned an interesting note, arguing that "the pain trade for NVIDIA is higher." Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso correctly points out that NVIDIA's Q1'26 earnings report was able to address "all investor concerns," which included "rack production, China (now out of numbers) and AI diffusion (not being enforced)." Caso also believes that NVIDIA's rate of rack shipments to customers is currently pushing ahead of its revenue run-rate, "and we would expect both to converge at some point." On the whole, the Wolfe Research analyst believes NVIDIA was under-owned heading into its Q1 earnings, which means that the pain trade remains in the bullish direction: "Net, we think the consensus view had been to own this stock for 2H and CY26, but the concerns heading into the report caused some to wait out this report. With the concerns now addressed, the stock up and a bullish outlook for 2H, we think the pain trade for NVDA is higher." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 25: In this photo illustration, the logo of NVIDIA Corporation is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. NVIDIA is a leading American technology company renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms, and data center solutions. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Currently, Nvidia (NASDAQ; NVDA) stock trades at 44 times its trailing earnings of $3.19 per share. This figure aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last two years, and growth has remained solid thus far. The real question is whether this growth will continue, which we’ll delve into in the sections below. First, let's examine what happened in the recently reported Q1. Nvidia recently announced its fiscal first-quarter results for the period ending April 2025, reporting adjusted earnings of $0.96 per share on revenues of $44.1 billion. This represents a significant 69% year-over-year increase in sales and a 57% growth in earnings. The company performed better than Wall Street’s expectations, which had projected adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share on sales of $44.3 billion. However, the company’s outlook of $45 billion in Q2 sales missed the Street’s estimates of around $46 billion. This weaker guidance was primarily due to an expected $8 billion hit to the top line from recent export restrictions on the company’s H20 chips bound for China. During the quarter, the company spent $14.1 billion on share repurchases and paid $244 million in dividends. Separately, see – What's Happening With CRM Stock? After exceeding analyst estimates, Nvidia’s stock surged around 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, May 28. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Looking at segments, data center revenue reached $39.1 billion, marking a 73% year-over-year increase. Gaming & AI PC was up 42%, Professional Visualization sales grew 19%, and Automotive & Robotics revenue increased by 72%. This growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for the company’s GPU chips, which are heavily used in generative AI applications. Nvidia has also ramped up large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their advanced AI capabilities and premium pricing, have contributed significantly to top-line growth. Nvidia’s Blackwell cloud is now available on major platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Microsoft has been a substantial buyer of these Blackwell chips. However, the company’s gross margins of 61% were down 1,790 basis points from 78.9% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge from H20 sales restrictions, the gross margin would have been 71.3%. Nvidia stock is a market darling, and its Q1 performance may lead to a further spike, possibly pushing it towards its 52-week high. However, consider this: can such growth truly be sustained? Is a valuation of 44 times trailing earnings justified? Nvidia's phenomenal growth is a recent phenomenon, and it might not last. Indeed, the entire AI boom could fizzle, or perhaps large AI models, in particular, could be deemed unnecessary. Deepseek's demonstration that smaller models can perform just as well, without even utilizing Nvidia's latest chips, raises questions. However, what are the odds that Nvidia's chips will cease to be in high demand? That's where the speculation begins. Nvidia's revenues have grown by more than 80% annually for each of the last three years, with last year exceeding 100% growth. Could this growth decelerate to 60% or even 40%? It almost certainly has to—and soon! Why? Nvidia’s largest customers include tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. Each of these companies spent tens of billions last year on Nvidia chips. Can these companies continue to increase their spending on Nvidia chips by 100% year after year, especially when their own revenues are growing at only about 15% annually? No, absolutely not. The era of Nvidia’s 80-100% growth must eventually come to an end. When this period of rapid expansion concludes, Nvidia’s valuation will likely drop significantly. In fact, we currently estimate Nvidia’s Valuation to be around $100 per share, reflecting a downside of over 25% from the current levels. Note that we will revise our model shortly to reflect the latest quarterly results. However, growth could then stabilize at a more sustainable pace of 20-30%, which, while not exceptionally high, is still respectable. That’s why you build a portfolio. A resilient one. Balance risk-reward. We did it in spades with the Trefis High Quality (HQ) portfolio. Balancing risk-reward is how HQ outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and the Russell 2000. HQ outperformed all of them, and clocked >91% returns since inception!

Title: Apple is falling behind its Magnificent 7 rivals. Here's why

The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. While the others — Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late — and quietly. The last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company’s attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. Technology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn’t had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI “companions” that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone’s dominance. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. Read more: Apple’s brutal year keeps getting worse Apple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg’s company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration’s 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026. Apple’s first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple’s crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it’s not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple’s App Store looms large. Wall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth. China has been central to Apple’s strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China’s smartphone market. And Apple can’t even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company’s ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China’s generative AI rules. The company’s struggles in China don’t even take into account the swirling — and massive — economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. On Apple’s last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump’s tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact. Apple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China — pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. But Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump’s Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. Announcements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud — and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy. Yes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn’t been enough. Right now, Apple isn’t losing. It’s just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse.
