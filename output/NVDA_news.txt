Title: Stocks Reach Highs On Oracle And Fed Expectations

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high last Thursday but declined fractionally on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed with Oracle’s (ORCL) earnings further reinforcing the artificial intelligence (AI) growth narrative. Notably, banks performed well, which hints that the market is expecting a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut next week and a resilient economy. All signs point to artificial intelligence as being a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Indications suggest that the adoption of artificial intelligence is continuing at a rapid pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. This spending has created a virtuous cycle of spending and earnings for several mega-cap technology companies, including many of the Magnificent 7, which have seen their earnings and valuations flourish. While not included in the Magnificent 7, Oracle (ORCL) has quietly become a beneficiary of the seemingly insatiable current demand for AI training and the emerging demand for AI inferencing. Oracle’s management believes that its architecture enables better AI training at a lower cost for clients, providing a competitive edge. Additionally, their legacy database business enables Oracle’s clients to utilize their own data to offer AI inferencing, producing actionable insights, decisions, and predictions. AI inferencing is the crucial next step to AI demand and growth, since it is the use case for AI and expands the potential demand base to all corporations. Last week, Oracle announced a remaining performance obligation (RPO) of $455.3 billion, which can be thought of as an order backlog or contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been fulfilled. Oracle’s RPO grew by $317.5 billion quarter-over-quarter from AI-related contracts. This growth in RPO stems from multi-year contracts, so this revenue will likely be realized over a roughly seven-year period. In any case, analysts’ estimates now expect Oracle’s revenue growth to accelerate from 8.4% year-over-year for fiscal 2025 to 21.9% in 2027. While the exact margins and thus profits on this new business remain unknown, the apparent demand for their services sent the stock soaring by 25.5% last week. The supportive news from Oracle fueled the continued rally in many AI-related technology companies, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) outperforming the S&P 500 handily last week. The August employment report saw payrolls grow by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Additionally, Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. Since then, on September 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released preliminary revisions to payroll data, showing that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the twelve months through March 2025 than were initially reported. This record-breaking downward revision roughly halved the job growth estimate from previous projections. According to recent data, the four-week average of initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to near a year-to-date high. While the absolute level of initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits looks benign, the trend is moving higher. Continuing claims for benefits are also above the lows, indicating a slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. While the four-week average of initial claims for benefits is typically used to remove the volatility, the weekly claims were the highest in over three years. Consensus estimates suggest that the weekly claims will revert to roughly the four-week average level this week, as the spike last week was primarily due to filings in Texas. Following the weaker jobs data, a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting is a virtual certainty. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut this week. Beyond the cut this week, markets expect an additional two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts for the remainder of 2025. Bottom line: The September rate cut is widely expected, so that the focus will shift to expectations for future cuts. The Fed’s release of its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with Chair Powell’s comments, will be closely scrutinized for clues as to the expected pace of lower short-term rates. There are only five companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with FedEx (FDX) as the most notable for economic insights. August retail sales are scheduled for Wednesday. The US consumer has remained resilient, which is crucial for economic growth expectations, as consumer spending is the primary driver. Expectations are for some moderation from last month’s pace, but the data will be watched for signs that tariffs or the softening job market might be weighing on spending. Stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of banks and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. Further, the implied expectation is that the Fed will cut interest rates aggressively enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. While there are signs of deterioration in the labor market, there remains little evidence of an impending recession, and tech spending around AI is supporting rapid earnings growth in that sector. While the Fed will almost certainly cut rates this week, the implied future pace of easing might be slower than markets would like, which could result in increased stock volatility.

Title: Business Is Booming for Many Tech Giants. They're Laying Workers Off Anyway.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

Title: OpenAI's Nonprofit Parent to Own More Than $100B Stake in ChatGPT Maker

OpenAI said its nonprofit parent will have an equity stake exceeding $100 billion in the ChatGPT maker, making it "one of the most well-resourced philanthropic organizations in the world." OpenAI, which said the "recapitalization would also enable us to raise the capital required to accomplish our mission," also said it and backer Microsoft (MSFT) had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, and were "actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement." OpenAI had initially announced plans last year to transform into a for-profit company, a condition for money it raised in funding rounds, including one where it raised $6.6 billion from investors including Microsoft and AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA). Becoming a for-profit company would allow OpenAI to make financial returns for its shareholders and also go public, marking a departure from its original mission of building open-source technology that wouldn't be subject to commercial priorities. Separately, Microsoft avoided a potentially massive antitrust fine from the European Union by striking a deal to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular office apps. The European Commission, the EU's enforcement arm, said it has accepted the moves by Microsoft to untie Teams from its productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers. Microsft will now make these apps available to consumers without Teams at a lower price, allow customers tied to longer licenses to switch and let customers move their data out of Teams to use competitors. Microsoft shares, which entered Friday up by almost a fifth this year, are rising 1.4% in premarket trading.

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Title: Nvidia has finally won over one of its biggest Wall Street bears

It seems that Nvidia's success is too great for one of Wall Street's biggest bears to ignore. In an update to clients, DA Davidson raised its rating on Nvidia stock from "neutral" to "buy" and raised its price target from $195 to $210 a share. That implies around 18% upside from current levels. It also reflects a sharp change in sentiment from what the firm has previously said about the stock, with analysts predicting as much as a 48% drop in March. "Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA," analysts led by Gil Luria, the firm's head of technology research, wrote. In the past, Luria and his team warned that spending from hyperscalers—mega-cap tech firms that are shelling out billions to further their AI ambitions—could peak in 2026, which could significantly impact Nvidia's business. The use cases for AI also need to be more significant to justify how much money comapnies are pouring into Nvidia, they added. But things have changed over the last six months. In a note shortly after Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, Luria said the firm's perspective on the stock had "shifted quite a bit" over the past half-year, thanks to the rapid development and adoption of AI among companies. Hyperscaler spending, meanwhile, doesn't look to be nearing a peak. "It does mean that the most important thing—the overwhelming growth in demand for compute—is the only thing that matters," Luria and other analysts wrote. "NVIDIA should be able to sustain growth over the next two years, regardless of which segment that growth comes from," he added. The majority of Wall Street analysts have issued "buy" ratings on Nvidia, even considering the stock's record-breaking run-up over the last several years. The AI chipmaker is up 32% year-to-date. Luria's team, though, said they would continue to keep an eye on several "cross-currents" they saw potentially working against the stock. Here are some of the factors on their radar: Jump to

Title: The AI Trade Picks Up Steam After Oracle's 'Truly Historic' Quarter

The artificial intelligence trade got a shot of adrenaline on Wednesday after results from database software and cloud provider Oracle suggested the AI spending bonanza has ample room to run. Oracle (ORCL) on Tuesday reported its backlog swelled to $455 billion, a 359% year-over-year increase, after it signed four multibillion-dollar cloud deals in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. Executives said the backlog is expected to surpass half a trillion as Oracle inks more big deals in the coming months. Oracle also forecast cloud revenue would grow from an estimated $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion in 2030, about $50 billion more than Wall Street had forecast. Oracle said most of that revenue forecast was already reflected in its backlog, giving some investors greater confidence in the numbers. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had signed a five-year contract worth $300 billion with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle’s projections completely overshadowed lackluster first-quarter results, and sent its shares soaring as much as 43% on Wednesday. The rising tide of robust AI spending was lifting plenty of boats on Wednesday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were recently up more than 4% and 9%, respectively, while chip design company Arm Holdings (ARM) surged more than 8%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) was up about 2%. Data center infrastructure provider Vertiv Holdings (VRT) jumped about 9%, while power generators Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) advanced 8% and 6%, respectively. Oracle’s major cloud competitors were the only drag on the AI trade on Wednesday. Amazon (AMZN) declined more than 3%, while Meta Platforms (META) dropped nearly 2%. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) ticked higher. Wall Street’s ebullience over the results was first visible on Oracle’s earnings call Tuesday night. “Even I’m sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward,” said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci at the top of the question and answer portion of the call. “I tell my team, ‘Pay attention to this’—even those that are not working on Oracle—‘because this is a career event happening right now,” DiFucci added. “There's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick. Others called the quarter “momentous” and the backlog growth “truly historic.” AI investments have been driven by what many have characterized as insatiable demand for training and inference, and Oracle’s results appeared to support that assessment. On Oracle’s earnings call, co-founder and chair Larry Ellison said an unnamed company had requested all of Oracle’s available inferencing capacity. “I’d never gotten a call like that,” Ellison said. Big Tech’s investment in capacity to meet that demand is expected to remain robust in the coming years, supported by healthy cash flows at the biggest cloud providers and supportive tax incentives. Cloud providers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have been key drivers of the AI infrastructure trade in recent years. Hyperscalers are expected to spend a cumulative $368 billion on infrastructure this year, with much of that earmarked for data centers and the chips and servers that fill them, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle on Tuesday forecast capital expenditures of $35 billion in the 12 months through May 2026, about $10 billion more than the figure executives gave as a minimum last quarter. Tax incentives written into the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act should also support AI infrastructure investment. Morgan Stanley expects the bill’s immediate capital investment depreciation provisions to boost Big Tech’s free cash flows by nearly $50 billion this year. The firm expects a sizable portion of those tax savings to be spent on AI infrastructure.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.
