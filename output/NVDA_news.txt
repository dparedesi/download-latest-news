Title: Tesla proposes Elon Musk pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Elon Musk, already the world’s richest person, could become the first trillionaire after the Tesla board unveiled a massive new pay package for its CEO to keep his focus on the troubled EV maker. The package would grant him additional shares of Tesla stock if the company is able to grow far beyond its current value, with a market capitalization far greater than any company has ever approached. Musk’s previous pay package, which added significantly to his massive wealth, also laid out ambitious growth plans that once appeared to be a reach – but which Tesla proved able to reach easily. The new pay package could grant Musk 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock. Those shares would be be worth $143.5 billion at today’s stock value. But Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The company stock would need to reach an overall value of $8.5 trillion for Musk to get all the shares, significantly above the current market capitalization of $1.1 trillion Those 423.7 million new shares that Musk would get under this package would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets spelled out in Friday’s proxy statement. If Tesla shares are able to reach the $8.5 billion market capitalization value, it could become the most valuable company ever. It would be worth roughly double the current market value of Nvidia (NVDA), the current most-valuable company on the market. Tesla is already the most valuable automaker by a large margin, even though legacy automakers, like second-most valuable automaker Toyota, sell far more vehicles and now make more profits. The company’s proxy statement that laid out Musk’s payment plan also included a shareholder proposal that Tesla take a stake in privately-held xAI, the artificial intelligence company that Musk also owns. That could help Elon Musk further consolidate his growing business empire. XAI recently purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion of his own money in 2022. The company did not take a position for or against that shareholder proposal, which does not give any details of how large a stake Tesla should take in xAI, and what price. But any such investment could further enrich Tesla since Musk is the primary owner of xAI. Musk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $139 billion at Thursday’s closing price. That stake, along with his stakes in xAI, rocket company SpaceX, and several other companies he has started and runs, have made him the richest person on the planet, worth $378 billion according to Bloomberg’s billionaire tracker. He currently has options to buy an additional 304 million shares of Tesla, but a judge in Delaware has twice struck down that 2018 pay package that granted him those options as illegal. Those rulings came despite overwhelming approval by Tesla shareholders – twice. The company again has tried to grant those options to Musk this year, and adding in those options, he now owns 18% of the company’s shares. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. But as Tesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to those ties (before he had a falling out with Trump), all those things resulted in Telsa’s stock losing those gains. The shares have recovered some of those losses, but they are still down 26% from the December peak. Still, Musk and his fans on Wall Street have insisted the company is well positioned to grow even larger and more successful in the future. He has continued to predict that his plans for self-driving cars – including a robotaxi service – will create massive profits and value for shareholders. The robotaxis would provide rides to passengers andalso allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for driverless rides when not in use. Musk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla’s car business. “It’s a big pay package but Tesla needs to keep its biggest asset in Musk as CEO,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN Friday. Ives is one of the bigger Tesla bulls on Wall Street. “In this AI era Musk now will drive its next leg of growth,” Ives added. “The Board had a $1 trillion dollar decision and made the right one.” The board’s proxy statement spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. In addition to his many business interests, he remains active in politics, despite his falling out with President Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party. Tesla, in its proxy statement, warned that it needed to incentivize Musk to focus his attention on growing the company. It said that during the negotiations on the pay package, “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.” The board said it “believes that Mr. Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realize its long-term mission at an unparalleled level.” But the company said it is also making plans for life after Elon Musk, saying it is already working on succession plans. And it said that one of the terms of the employment package that Musk must meet to receive the final 70 million shares of stock is that he needs to have “developed a framework for Chief Executive Officer succession.” “The board regularly discusses management succession planning and leadership development,” said the proxy statement. It said those succession plans are “for both sudden, unanticipated events, in addition to longer-term planned succession for its executives.” It said it “believes that management has developed a robust pipeline of seasoned leadership talent within Tesla,” and that is also looking at possible external talent. Musk does not receive a cash salary from Tesla. All of his compensation comes from Tesla shares and options he has been granted in the past. Since there is still an ongoing court fight over the 304 million options, Musk has not received any compensation for nearly a decade, since a 2012 pay package made its last disbursement of options to him in 2017. But not all tech billionaires receive additional stock options or grants as compensation, instead benefiting from the increased valuations of their existing stakes in their companies. That includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook. Both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. Musk is on record saying it’s important that he needs to control at least 25% of Tesla shares. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” That need for control is what’s behind this pay package, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an investment firm and one of the early investors in Tesla. “This is all about Musk being scared about being kicked out of Tesla because he only owns 13%,” said Gerber, who has sold almost his entire stake in Tesla. Gerber said he also has problems with the size of the proposed pay package. “If he hits them (the financial and market share targets) then in some ways it (the pay package) is warranted,” Gerber said. “But I think it goes back to what level of greed can you reach in a modern society that’s enough.” If Musk and his fans are right, Musk would become far wealthier even without any additional shares of Tesla stock. His current holdings of 410 million Tesla shares, even without the disputed 304 million options, would be worth nearly $1 trillion more than today’s valuation, should Tesla’s market cap rise to $8.5 billion. But Musk won’t get any of the shares of stock until the company raises its market cap to $2 trillion, or nearly twice as valuable as it is today. And he would have to meet at least one of a number of ambitious operational and financial goals, such as having a million robots in operation or getting its adjusted operating income up to $50 billion, which would be well above the record $19.2 billion it earned on that basis in 2022, let alone the $16.6 billion it made last year. But to achieve those targets, it would have to start doing the things Musk is promising in terms of self-driving vehicles and its robotaxi. And that would mean meeting grand claims from a man and company that have often fallen short of their promises. Tesla critics say that the stock has become grossly overvalued because of Wall Street’s willingness to buy into Musk’s vision of the future in terms of AI, self-driving vehicles and robots, despite its failures to deliver on past promises along those lines. “Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 ‘we will have a fully autonomous car next year.’ It hasn’t happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,” said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. “Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He’s been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he’s willing to say things that other CEOs aren’t willing to say or get away with.” And some critics, such as Gerber, say another problem with the package is that it will lead Musk and Tesla to pursue and promise the kind of goals that will lift its stock price, more than it will get him to focus on fixing the problems facing its EV business. Tesla is facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, one of those Chinese automakers, is poised to pass Tesla for the most EV sales worldwide, even though it is not available for sale in the United States. US law also recently removed the billions of dollars in penalties that traditional automakers have had to pay if their gas-powered vehicles exceed emissions rules. The way that they avoided those payments in the past was by buying regulatory credits from an EV maker like Tesla. But the payments that brought billions in revenue to Tesla will now vanish. Johnson said that Tesla’s stock price is unlikely to hit the ambitious targets laid out in this Musk pay package due to the problems it faces. “Things are going to get worse for them, not better,” said Johnson. “Is Tesla going to go to $8 trillion? Abso-f**king-lutely not.” Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were up about 5% in early trading on the news. This story has been updated with additional context and reporting.

Title: Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/nvidia-stock-to-fall-50-as-ai-cycle-turns/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has indisputably led the AI boom. Its GPUs are considered the gold standard for training extensive AI models, resulting in sales growth from $27 billion in FY'23 to an anticipated $200 billion this fiscal year. In addition to selling the highest performance chips, the company's CUDA software ecosystem has effectively retained customers. While Nvidia is expected to continue its reign as the leader in AI hardware for years ahead, its stock valuation of nearly 40x forward earnings signifies not only its leadership but also expectations of ongoing, multi-year growth. This renders it vulnerable: even a slight decrease in demand or a structural shift in the AI lifecycle – from focusing on training workloads to inference – could undermine investor confidence and cause significant declines. Historical events highlight this risk – following the Covid-era surge in GPU demand for gaming and cryptocurrency, inflation and reduced demand led Nvidia shares to plummet almost 66% from peak to trough, in contrast to a mere 25% decline for the S&P 500. The stock’s volatility suggests a similar drop could occur if the current AI growth phase slows. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to examine how the stock has bounced back from sharp dips in the past. Over the past two years, companies have invested vast resources into developing AI models. Training these enormous models usually requires a concentrated effort that demands significant computing power, with Nvidia being the largest beneficiary, as its GPUs are widely seen as the fastest and most efficient for these operations. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. Incremental performance improvements are waning as models become larger, while access to high-quality training data is becoming a limiting factor – much of what is readily available online has already been utilized in current models. Collectively, these factors imply that the most demanding phase of AI training might start to plateau. Adding to the uncertainty, the economics of the GPU market remains challenging, as numerous Nvidia customers continue to struggle to yield significant returns on their substantial AI investments. In contrast, inference involves applying trained models to new data in real-time and at scale. It is less intensive per task but occurs continually across millions of users and applications. As AI evolves, a larger portion of value creation could shift from training to inference. The challenge for Nvidia is that its growth has been primarily linked to training, where its high-end GPUs have a stronghold. Inference presents an opportunity for more mid-performance and cost-effective chip alternatives, as well as specialized offerings. Here’s a glimpse at some of the main competitors in the inference sector. AMD has notably trailed Nvidia during the initial phase of AI development, but it could become a significant competitor to Nvidia in inference. Its chips are becoming increasingly competitive in performance while providing cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premier GPUs. Many are likely to choose older Nvidia models or budget-friendly alternatives such as AMD’s (NASDAQ:AMD) MI series, which delivers solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. See How AMD stock surges to $330. ASICs or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits are also gaining momentum. Unlike GPUs, which are flexible and programmable, ASICs are designed for a specific task, making them more cost- and power-efficient for inference workloads. The cryptocurrency sector offers a precedent: Bitcoin mining began with GPUs but swiftly transitioned to ASICs once scale and efficiency became vital. A similar trend could emerge in AI inference. Two companies likely to benefit from this shift are Marvell and Broadcom, both of which possess expertise in creating custom silicon for hyperscalers. U.S. Big Tech players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet, and Meta are all designing AI chips. Amazon has focused on training-oriented chips, Meta began with inference and is expanding into training, while Google accommodates both with its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the goal is not necessarily to outdo Nvidia in the marketplace but to reduce costs, enhance bargaining power, and manage supply for their expansive cloud ecosystems. Over time, this translates to diminished incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. In Q2, Nvidia reported that just two of its clients accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue, and it is highly plausible that these were major U.S. tech firms. This concentration makes Nvidia significantly more susceptible. If hyperscalers increasingly turn to proprietary silicon, even minor changes in purchasing behavior could lead to substantial revenue implications. Chinese Players In China, firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, and Huawei are enhancing their AI chip initiatives. Reports last week indicated that Alibaba plans to introduce a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to facilitate inference at scale using its own technology stack, and to ensure a reliable supply of semiconductors in light of U.S. export restrictions. Currently, Nvidia’s GPUs are still anticipated to serve as the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training operations, but inference is poised to become the long-term growth driver for the firm. Nvidia’s position is still robust due to its established ecosystem, substantial R&D investments, and supremacy in training. However, inference is expected to become the next growth engine for AI hardware, and the competitive landscape is significantly more crowded. Even a slight dip in growth could heavily impact the stock, considering how much future performance is already factored in. For investors, the critical question is whether Nvidia’s growth trajectory can align with the elevated expectations set by the market. If the economics of inference prove less advantageous than those of training, the stock could still face a “valuation reset” despite retaining its technological leadership. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, inclusive of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

According to Solana Status on X, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. In total, 52% of the network’s stakers participated in the vote. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana’s existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Alpenglow will overhaul both systems. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming.With approval secured, Solana is now preparing to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. EF TO SELL 10K ETH OVER NEXT FEW WEEKS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) shared in a post on X on Tuesday that it plans to sell 10,000 ETH through centralized exchanges over the next several weeks to support work toward research & development, ecosystem grants and related donations. According to CoinMarketCap, the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X.The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy in June that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multiyear reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making the online casino marketing firm the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. A CHAT WITH BRUCE LIU ON OP_CAT: Without OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as "useful as a jumbo jet without wings" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar. Liu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other layer-1 chains. OP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs. The Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu. "OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. — Sam Reynolds Read more. HOLESKY SUNSET IS COMING AFTER FUSAKA UPGRADE: A fresh slate of Ethereum testnets is replacing Holesky, the once-massive staging ground now set for shutdown after two years of service.The wind-down will occur two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade is finalized later this year, at which point client and infrastructure teams will cease providing support. Fusaka is set to make Ethereum rollups cheaper and faster by spreading out the “data storage work” more evenly across validators. Holesky went live in 2023 to stress-test Ethereum’s proof-of-stake machinery at scale. It quickly became the largest public testnet, providing thousands of validators with a platform to trial upgrades before they were deployed on the mainnet. Major milestones, such as the Dencun and Pectra upgrades — which lowered transaction costs and upgraded validator efficiency, among other features — were run through Holesky first. However, cracks began to appear as the network aged. Holesky encountered “inactivity leaks” after Pectra’s activation in early 2025, a term referring to validators going offline in large numbers, which created a significant backlog for those attempting to exit. The result was months-long queues that made it impractical to test the full validator lifecycle. For developers needing fast feedback loops, Holesky had become more of a roadblock than a tool. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

Ondo Finance launched Wednesday its tokenized equity platform dubbed Ondo Global Markets, offering non-U.S. investors access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on-chain. The tokenized equities, first announced in February, has gone live on Ethereum and are backed by securities held at U.S.-registered broker-dealers, the firm said. The offering includes crypto token versions of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and the QQQ ETF among others. Investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and Latin America can mint and redeem shares around the clock during trading days, with access to underlying exchange liquidity. The service is not available for U.S. users. The tokens are designed to move freely between wallets, exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm has also partnered with BitGo, Ledger, Chainlink and other infrastructure providers to support the rollout. Ondo said it plans to expand the selection to more than 1,000 assets by the end of this year and bring the service to Solana SOL$202.84 and BNB Chain (BNB) with LayerZero-powered interoperability. "We saw stablecoins export the U.S. dollar by bringing it on-chain," said Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance. "Now, Ondo Global Markets is doing the same thing for U.S. securities." The rollout comes as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) gains momentum across crypto markets, with projects bringing treasuries, private credit and now equities onto blockchains pursuing broader access and liquidity. A list of trading platforms and exchanges have introduced tokenized equities in the past few months, including by Robinhood, Gemini, Kraken and several other crypto exchanges. Coinbase and eToro also shared plans to offer stock trading in token form. However, some offerings drew backlash over potential issues such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.

Title: Watch for this signal in Nvidia stock to capitalize on spring-loaded gains ahead
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-trading-strategy-buy-signal-short-ratio-nvda-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T12:40:55Z

It's been a volatile year for shares of Nvidia, with the stock plunging 31% to start the year before rallying 84% since April lows. Sam Pierson, the director of research at S3 Partners, has found a fairly reliable way to capitalize on that volatility. Or rather, a metric to watch within the stock that serves as a signal for outsized gains ahead. It's called the long-to-short ratio, and it's calculated by taking a stock's active long interest and dividing it by short interest. In new research published Tuesday, Pierson found that following notable increases in the ratio, Nvidia's share price has typically surged over the following few months. More specifically, when the ratio climbs to 1.5 standard deviations above its six-month moving average, it's gone up 11% over the following month. That's nearly double the usual average monthly gain of 6%. For the subsequent three-month period, following the signal, Nvidia has returned 28%, versus 19% normally. The stock saw gains 86% of the time in the month following a reading above the 1.5-standard-deviation threshold. When the stock saw rare losses during those periods, it only fell by an average of 1%. These findings led Pierson to call the ratio a "powerful short-to-intermediate-term tool," as it seems to lose its ability to predict returns beyond six months. Here's a chart showing the returns. Periods when the long-to-short ratio is at least at 1.5 are shaded orange. Nvidia's stock returns are shown in the black line. Right now, the measure is below the 1.5 standard-deviation threshold as the ratio of long positions to short positions has fallen in recent weeks to 15.4. The model has continued to be effective so far this year. "In 2025 year-to-date, the LTS extreme signal has remained effective: across 46 threshold days, NVDA delivered an average +7% forward 1M return with a 76% win rate, compared with just +5% on all days, with a 54% win rate," Pierson wrote. He added: "In 2025, periods of Long-to-Short crowding in NVIDIA have coincided with roughly double the baseline 1-month forward return." Nvidia stock has had a rough 10 days after it warned of slowing growth ahead during its quarterly earnings call last week. Since August 26, the stock is down 6.5%. The stock remains a favorite among investors. Brokerage platform Interactive Brokers said Nvidia was the most bought stock over the last five trading days with 234,628 buy orders. "Our customers are certainly a faithful bunch. #1 NVDA brought immense success to many of them, and they are clearly not willing to abandon that name even if some poorly received earnings get in the way," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in an email. He continued: "It was not only the most active stock on our platform, displacing #3 PLTR, last week's surprise leader, but also representing just under 1/3 of all the net purchasing activity among the stocks in this table."

U.S. stocks lost ground on the first trading day of September. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session down 0.7% as the markets returned to action following the extended Labor Day weekend. The Dow slid 0.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.8%. Chip stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) slipping 2% in Monday's session. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The labor market is likely to be in focus during the shortened trading week, with investors looking toward Friday morning's release of an August jobs report that could have major implications for Federal Reserve policymakers deliberating possible interest-rate cuts at their meeting later this month. Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) tumbled 7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, after the packaged food giant announced a plan to separate its North American grocery business from its sauces and spreads unit. The grocery business includes Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, while the larger sauce-focused company will remain the home of Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The announcement of the split-up, which the company expects to close in the second half of 2026, came a decade after the megamerger between Kraft and Heinz created one of the world's largest food companies. Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) cut its adjusted profit guidance, citing tariff impacts and slumping beer demand. The maker of the Modelo and Corona beer brands now anticipates a 2% to 4% decline in beer sales in fiscal 2026 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on consumer spending. Constellation Brands shares sank 6.6% on Tuesday. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, lost 6.3%. Baird analysts raised their price target on Albemarle stock ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting a recovery in lithium prices following capacity cuts by a major producer in China. However, Baird maintained its "underperform" rating on Albemarle stock, citing limited visibility into the dynamics of the lithium market and uncertainty surrounding Chinese government policy. Shares of beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped 8.1%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance to claw back the heavy losses posted Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading. Ahead of the holiday weekend, Barclays analysts raised their price target on Ulta shares, pointing to the cosmetic company's strong second-quarter results as well as positive strategic initiatives under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the reins at Ulta at the beginning of 2025. Biogen (BIIB) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an injectable version of Leqembi, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease produced by the biotech company in collaboration with Japanese pharmaceutical firm Esai. Whereas patients previously needed to travel to an infusion center for a time-consuming process twice per month, Leqembi can be taken at home via a weekly under-the-skin injection. Biogen shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday. Shares of fashion company Ralph Lauren (RL) advanced 4.8% to reach an all-time closing high. The company received a boost last week when a dress made by Ralph Lauren was featured in engagement photos released by the superstar recording artist Taylor Swift.

Title: Why Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks' Slump Is an Opportunity for Investors, UBS Says

Semiconductor stocks are taking a chip out of U.S. indexes to start September—a month that's earned a reputation as the worst for American investors—but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy. "We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas," UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 2%. Tuesday's slide extended losses late last week, amid uncertainty after an appeals court Friday challenged the legality of the Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs, and concerns about America's relations with major trading partners. Treasury yields spiked as bonds sold off, which tends to weigh on the tech sector as higher yields may make growth stocks less attractive. Some investors could also be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks—but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow. UBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector. "Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials," the analysts said.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers

As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating. CORRECTION—Sept. 2, 2025: This article has been corrected to reflect the U.S. was not represented at the summit in Tianjin and President Trump did not attend.
