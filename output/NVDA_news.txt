Title: Dan Ives' Wedbush ETF tracking AI stocks launches

Time Published: 2025-06-04T18:00:06Z
Full Content:
Dan Ives, a tech analyst known for his bullish calls on Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), Tesla, and the generative AI boom, is offering investors a way to buy into his thesis — literally. On Tuesday, Wedbush Securities, where Ives is the managing director, launched the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (ticker: IVES), a portfolio of 30 U.S. tech companies selected by Ives and his team for their exposure to AI. The fund trades on the NYSE Arca and carries a 0.75% expense ratio. The ETF includes familiar names such as Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Tesla (TSLA-3.33%), and Palantir (PLTR+1.01%) — companies Ives has championed as foundational to the next phase of digital transformation. The ETF tracks what Wedbush calls the “Ives AI 30,” a list of companies the company sees as best positioned to commercialize and scale AI across sectors — from semiconductors to cloud platforms to next-gen software. “It’s based on our research,” Ives told CNBC. “As new companies come in, then some companies could come out. This is a living organism, in terms of this AI 30. It’s not static. And that’s a key part of the theme here, because the theme will continue to evolve.” That puts the fund into what Wedbush executives say is a bit of a hybrid category. “We’re kind of walking this line between active and passive,” said Cullen Rogers, chief investment officer at Wedbush Fund Advisers, who is overseeing the ETFs day-to-day operations. “We’re just looking to leverage Dan’s ideas as well as we can in an institutional framework... that gives investors a consistent, predictable structure.” Ives has been among Wall Street’s most vocal AI bulls, describing the moment as a generational investment opportunity. In recent client notes, he’s called AI “the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years” and likened AI chips to “the new gold and oil.” “The AI revolution is the biggest tech theme we’ve ever seen,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. He said he started the ETF “because it’s about the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI playing out, and that’s the important thing for investors.” The launch lands at a time when AI-related stocks are surging. But whether or not the market stays this hot is a big question. “Dan’s track record speaks for itself,” Wedbush CEO Gary Wedbush said in a press release. “He’s been identifying the drivers of tech disruption for years, and the IVES ETF gives investors a chance to follow that insight in a disciplined, transparent way.” Wedbush is betting that the AI rally is far from over — and that the company’s strategy can stand out as the space matures.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is ‘motivated by fear and guilt,’ biographer says

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang may run one of the most important companies in the world, but he can’t credit his success to the power of positive thinking. “I think the most surprising thing about Jensen is that he’s almost totally driven by negative emotions,” said Stephen Witt, who spent hours interviewing the Nvidia co-founder for his book, “The Thinking Machine.” “This is his fuel. This is his gasoline, [and it’s] what makes him go is this anxiety,” he told CNBC. According to Witt, Huang fears Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), which is valued at more than $3.3 trillion, could fall apart at any time. Witt said he was surprised by how much negative emotions seem to motivate Huang, who “becomes very uncomfortable and nervous when things are going well.” Huang does best when acting like Nvidia is “on the brink of failure at all times,” Witt said. “This is the narrative he generates around himself — that he could fail at any time and be disgraced. And this is what motivates him.” Witt continued: “Jensen, of course, is an obvious, huge go-getter, but it’s all coming from this place of almost beating himself up for not working hard enough all the time. I didn’t expect to see that.” While that mindset might sound exhausting, it has worked well for Huang, who according to Forbes, is the 16th richest person in the world in 2025. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 with two colleagues, and steered the company through an period where it almost had to close up shop just a few years later. Now, the chipmaker has never been more prolific. It reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter this year.

Title: Nvidia Stock Rises After Reclaiming Crown From Microsoft as World's Most Valuable Firm

Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company again. Nvidia shares are rising nearly 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after it edged out Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% to $141.22 and putting the AI chipmaker’s value at $3.444 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap was $3.441 trillion at its close Tuesday. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to occupy the spot as the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. They are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Despite their gains, Nvidia’s market cap is still below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Shares of Nvidia as well as others linked to the AI boom tumbled then when China's DeepSeek released a low-cost model that raised investor concerns about the future dominance of American AI firms. On Tuesday, Jefferies added Nvidia to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” touting the company as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train AI models.

Title: 6 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For June 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. The best growth stocks are well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Many growth stocks lost value in the heat of the whiplash tariff announcements in early April. As a group, they’re crawling their way back towards positive for the year, at least according to the Russell 1000 Growth index. The current window for capturing good prices on growth stocks may be closing. If you prefer not to wait for the next round of selloffs and you're ready for some investing inspiration, take a look at the six promising growth stocks below. These six best growth stocks have strong recent and projected sales and earnings per share (EPS) growth, plus conservative debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios. They are also more than 50% owned by institutional investors, such as hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, insurance companies and other large money managers. These are folks with access to sophisticated research teams and tools. When this crowd loves a stock, it signals confidence in that company’s growth prospects. Here are the exact screening metrics used to identify these growth stocks: The table below introduces the six best stocks to buy now, according to the above parameters. A more detailed review of each stock follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and long-term growth stocks. Nvidia designs and sells semiconductors and related hardware. The company also maintains a suite of software development tools. Customers include automotive OEMs, device manufacturers, cloud providers, internet companies and distributors. Nvidia has a dominant market share in AI-capable chips used in data centers. The company's products also have automotive, gaming, robotics and telecommunications applications. It’s commonplace to see Nvidia in a list of top growth stocks. The magnitude of the company's growth trajectory almost demands it. Since early 2023, Nvidia has increased annual sales from $26 billion to $130 billion, while its market cap has ballooned from $500 billion to $3.3 trillion. That happened after the company had raised annual sales by about 25% on average in the previous five years. AI adoption fueled this recent growth phase, but Nvidia has a long history of vision, innovation and execution—the trifecta of success factors in technology. While the biggest gains are already on the books, Nvidia isn’t likely to stop growing. The company has $53.7 billion of cash on its balance sheet, plus a savvy founder/CEO to keep competition at bay. For the first quarter 2026, Nvidia reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 69% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27%. The results included a $4.5 billion charge resulting from changes in the U.S. government’s policy on chip sales to China. Analysts expect Nvidia to deliver 56% revenue growth and 50.7% EPS growth in fiscal 2026. Tradeweb builds and maintains investment trading marketplaces for stocks, bonds, credit, derivatives and other asset classes. The technology focus is on faster trades and data transparency. Clients are institutional investors and wealth managers. Tradeweb values its total addressable market at $8.9 trillion. With annual sales of $1.8 billion, the company owns only a sliver of the market. The largest opportunities are in ETFs and credit, where Tradeweb has 6% and 17% market share, respectively. The growth plan involves acquisitions and customer-driven technology innovation, particularly in rules-based trading. Tradeweb has expertise in automation. It launched its flagship Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool for U.S. Treasuries in 2012. As rules-based trading has become more popular, so has AiEX. The company is also incorporating AI to provide customers with advanced analytics before and after trades. For the first quarter 2025, Tradeweb reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 24.7% and diluted EPS growth of 16.9%. For the full year 2025, analysts expect sales and EPS increases of 23.3% and 51.6%, respectively. Monday.com builds and maintains software that business teams use to manage projects, collaborate, track sales leads and organize software development workflows. Customers include businesses, educational institutions and governments. Monday.com solutions fit in between overbuilt, expensive enterprise applications and off-the-shelf software that can’t fully address a team's unique workflows. The company's Work Operating System is a modular, customizable system clients can use to build the tools they need, without the expense and extended implementation timeline—two hallmarks of enterprise software. The functional, but robust product offering has propelled the company’s sales from $161 million in 2020 to $972 million last year. In that time, Monday.com has made strong progress moving up-market to a higher-dollar customer base, which is a key element of the growth strategy. While earnings just turned positive in 2024, Monday.com’s free cash flow in both 2023 and 2024 exceeded $200 million. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, an ample source of growth funding. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, Monday.com reported 30% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, 38% more customers worth $50,000-plus in annual sales and a non-GAAP operating margin of 14%. Analysts expect Monday.com to produce 28% sales growth and 523% EPS growth in 2025. Nova provides equipment, technology and solutions to help semiconductor manufacturers produce chips faster and more efficiently. The company specializes in dimensional metrology solutions, which provide precision size and shape measurements. Nova solutions address multiple stages of the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle. Customers include leading integrated circuit manufacturers in Asia, Europe and North America. Semiconductor manufacturing is a thriving industry. According to a recent Deloitte report, 2024 semiconductor sales grew 19% to $627 billion. Expected 2025 sales are $697 billion, placing the industry on an easy pace to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030 and $2 trillion by 2040. Nova’s role in helping manufacturers improve efficiency and output is critical to that growth. The company has an interesting mix of advantages: innovative technologies, a high-margin business model and ample growth opportunity. With that foundation, the leadership team is targeting $1 billion in sales by 2027. The 2027 outlook also includes a gross margin of 57% to 60%, R&D spend of 15% to 17% of sales and EPS close to $10—a 75% increase from the 2024 EPS of $5.75. For the first quarter, Nova reported 50% sales growth and 77% GAAP diluted EPS growth vs. the prior-year period. Analysts expect Nova to deliver sales growth of 30% and EPS growth of 49% in 2025. Krystal Biotech develops and sells genetic therapies treating rare diseases. In 2023, the company received FDA approval for Vyjuvek, the first treatment for the skin disorder dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Vyjuvek is now available in the U.S. and expanding globally. Krystal Biotech additionally has five active clinical programs addressing cystic fibrosis, solid tumors and another skin disorder, lamellar ichthyosis. Krystal Biotech focuses on identifying therapies for conditions with high unmet needs. As an example, before the U.S. launch of Vyjuvek, there was no treatment for DEB despite the severity of the disease. DEB is associated with recurring and chronic wounds that are costly to treat, as well as increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The company is also developing a treatment for Apha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a disorder that precedes progressive lung disease. More than 250,000 patients worldwide have AATD. There is no cure and treatment options are limited. KRYS additionally has scalable, in-house manufacturing capacity to support Vyjuvek’s global expansion and other growth opportunities. Krystal Biotech began generating revenue in 2023. 2024 sales eclipsed $290 million, and EPS totaled $3 per share. Analysts expect 48.7% revenue growth and 104.3% EPS growth this year. Liquidity Services sells its clients' surplus assets on the world's largest B2B ecommerce network, via self-serve and fully managed auction offerings. Operating in more than 100 countries, the company has 5.7 million registered buyers and facilitates 1 million transactions annually. Liquidity Services adds value on three levels. Clients have an easy solution for liquidating unneeded assets, buyers have access to assets at liquidation pricing and landfills have less waste to process. The company also has an enviable client list spanning multiple industries and regions. Chevron, Shell, Sony, Volvo, P&G, Walmart and Amazon are among the names that LQDT services. The company values its addressable market at over $130 billion, which it breaks down into five sectors: Liquidity Services has regularly increased its gross merchandise volume and revenue since fiscal 2021. In its most recent quarter, LQDT reported sales growth of 27% and GAAP diluted EPS growth of 22%. Analysts expect a 35% revenue increase and a 99% increase in EPS in fiscal 2025. Bottom Line Growth stocks can move fast, up and down. Opt for well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Those qualities help growth players thrive in good times and survive in bad ones.

Title: Nvidia Added to Jefferies 'Franchise Picks'
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-added-to-jefferies-franchise-picks-11747136
Time Published: 2025-06-03T14:30:36Z

Jefferies has added Nvidia (NVDA) to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” a group its analysts describe as “our highest-conviction, Buy-rated stocks.” In Nvidia’s case, the reason for conviction is the chipmaker’s position as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train artificial intelligence models. Jefferies came away from Nvidia’s quarterly results impressed with the chipmaker’s revenue projections—which largely mirrored what analysts expected despite a larger-than-expected impact from U.S. export curbs. Nvidia said it expects to take an $8 billion hit this quarter due to lost revenue from sales of H20 chips, which the Trump administration barred from being sold in China. The analysts pointed to the “massive step up” in AI commitments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a reason for revenue optimism. Last month, Nvidia agreed to supply chips to Saudi AI startup Humain, while the U.S. and UAE reached a deal allowing the Middle Eastern nation to import American-made AI chips. Nvidia, grappling with Microsoft (MSFT) for the title of the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at more than $3.4 trillion, traded 2% higher shortly after the opening bell Tuesday. The stock has gained roughly 5% so far in 2025.

Title: The Trump administration is delaying a 25% tariff on Chinese-made graphics cards
URL: https://qz.com/trump-tariff-delay-chinese-graphics-cards-gpu-1851783407
Time Published: 2025-06-02T21:14:00Z
Full Content:
Graphics cards and motherboards assembled in China are avoiding President Donald Trump’s import taxes, for now. In a three-page notice published Saturday in the Federal Register, the Office of the Trade Representative said it was “appropriate” to extend a moratorium that won’t subject vendors of electronics equipment to tariffs on graphics cards and graphics processing units. The measure stems from a long-running Section 301 investigation into Chinese economic policies and whether they are harming American companies. That federal probe started under the first Trump administration, and it would apply a 25% tariff if officials conclude that Chinese companies had an unfair advantage. The 25% tariff has been inactive due to a string of reprieves from both the Biden and Trump administrations. China remains the world’s largest electronics manufacturer, according to the International Trade Centre; the nation is still subject to a minimum 30% import tax by the Trump administration, barring some exemptions. Major tech companies including Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) were spared the brunt of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs in April. A federal court battle is now brewing over the fate of those tariffs. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Applied Digital (APLD) rose nearly 50% Monday after announcing a deal to lease data center space to AI darling CoreWeave (CRWV). Applied Digital inked a pair of 15-year deals to host CoreWeave AI infrastructure at its Ellendale, N.D., campus. The deal is expected to generate $7 billion in total revenue over the decade-and-a-half span; the company reported about $53 million in revenue in its most recently completed quarter. Both Applied Digital and CoreWeave are backed by Nvidia (NVDA), the second-most valuable company in the world and the chipmaking giant most associated with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nvidia held roughly 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital and 24.2 million shares of CoreWeave as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. CoreWeave provides its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company’s data centers are equipped with Nvidia chips. Shares of CoreWeave rose about 8% on Monday.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Staged a Blistering May Rally. What's Next?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-staged-a-blistering-may-rally-what-s-next-11746644
Time Published: 2025-06-02T19:12:00Z
Full Content:
The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.
