We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy. QAI uses fundamental equations to generate new data, which enables advancements in drug development, materials for energy storage, and aerospace. Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs. This evolution underscores a future where AI goes beyond text-based applications, becoming a cornerstone for innovation across various industries.

Title: Hennessy Predicts 2025 Will Be Good Year For Mid-Cap Stocks

Portfolio managers of the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, from left, Joshua Wien, Ryan Kelley, ... [+] Neil Hennessy discussing stocks in the Hennessy Funds office. After this year’s tremendous runup in mega-cap tech growth stocks, next year the market will probably see a shift to value and mid-cap stocks predicted Neil Hennessy, chairman and chief market strategist of Hennessy Funds, at the company’s recent market outlook press conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, and the S&P 500 Index’s P/E at 24, are both distorted by tech stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA). The year-to-date returns of the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite are 15.7%, 26%, and 31% respectively, as of Dec. 20, according to Morningstar. This rapid expansion is unsustainable and will create volatility in the indexes. “People are going to end up being very disappointed with the indexes or they're going to enjoy the roller coaster ride because it's going to be all over the place,” said Hennessy, who is also the chairman and chief executive of Hennessy Advisors (HNNA), the funds’ parent company. Based in Novato, CA, the firm has 17 funds with $4.8 billion in assets under management. He predicts 2025 will see the market shift from growth stocks to value investing and stock picking, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks. Mid-caps are companies with capitalizations between $1 billion and $10 billion. He likes mid-caps because they’re undervalued, at about 18x forward earnings, compared to companies with large-capitalizations. Mid-caps are also diversified, have multiple business lines, and are more nimble than large-caps. They also have strong performance potential with lower volatility compared to small-cap stocks. Over the long-term, mid-caps outperform large-caps, and could experience a surge as large-cap stocks face increased volatility, said Hennessy. For the broader economy, the firm forecasts inflation will remain under control, and interest rates will remain stagnant, neither helping nor hurting businesses or consumers. However, consumers are expected to be resilient, with consumer spending expected to stay robust despite projections of a slower holiday season. Other positive factors include low unemployment, strong job openings, as well as, healthy corporate profits and cash flows. The perennial market bull said that aside from AI and cryptocurrencies, there is not widespread euphoria in the market, and that investors need to focus on diversification and stock picking. Going forward, he thinks U.S. equities offer moderate risk for reward because of a positive outlook for earnings, and a lot of cash for stock buybacks and dividends. Overall, there is still a lot of cash on the sidelines. As of Oct. 31, S&P 500 companies held $7.1 trillion on their balance sheets, according to Bloomberg. Money market funds held $7.0 trillion and bank deposits are at record highs of $17.3 trillion, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a fund company trade group. He sees sector rotation into more defensive sectors —consumer discretionary, industrials, and utilities) if the growth stocks slowdown. Financial stocks are also expected to do well on improving interest rates and a healthy banking system. Hennessy pointed to the stock-picking success of the firm’s Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (HFMDX) (up 30.8% last year and year-to-date returns of 36.3%, according to Morningstar,) as a way to capture returns without relying on the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks. The fund has outperformed the S&P 500 over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods, according to Morningstar, and received the firm’s 1% ranking as of the end of the third quarter. The concentrated portfolio of just 30 stocks focuses on mid-cap stocks with a strategy of combining value investing, earnings momentum, and stock momentum. Consumer discretionary and industrials make up more than 50% of the fund. The fund has a lower valuation than the overall market with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.9 vs. the Russell Midcap Indexes’ 1.8 and a forward PE ratio of 12.6. It won the 2024 Refinitiv Lipper Fund Award for Best-in-Category performance for the 5-year period, beating 826 funds. It charges an expense ratio of 1.34%. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Where I Plan To Buy Nvidia Stock Next

Blackwell is the word for Nvidia as the AI leader heads into 2025, with multiple configurations and a mid-year upgrade (B300/GB300) for its new powerful GPU set to ramp significantly over the next few quarters. As recapped to the I/O Fund’s premium members after its Q3 earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking multiple supply chain signals indicating Blackwell sales will likely far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined – to the tune of bringing Nvidia to $200 billion in data center revenue. Analysts are already increasing their forecasts for Blackwell shipments for Q4 and for Q1, with forecasts for 250,000 to 300,000 shipments in Q4 nearly tripling to 750,000 to 800,000 in Q1. This compares to previous views seeing Q4 shipments of 150,000 to 200,000 ramping to 550,000 in Q1. This suggests Blackwell revenue estimates for Q1 are already moving 40-60% higher, potentially driving positive revenue revisions throughout the year as it becomes Nvidia’s primary GPU product. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - MAY 30: An exterior view of the NVIDIA headquarters on May 30, 2023 in ... [+] Santa Clara, California. Chipmaker NVIDIA reached a $1 trillion market cap at the open bell of the NYSE on Tuesday morning. The company is forecasting second quarter sales of $11 billion, 50 percent higher than analyst estimates of $7.15 billion. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia has tailwinds in 2025 from increased pricing power with Blackwell, output and shipment estimates already rising before the ramp begins, AI capex still quickly growing, and GPU clusters starting in the 100K range where Hopper maxed out, even as competition from AMD, Broadcom and others begins to increase. Nvidia also has the benefit from the end of its fiscal year early next year, with the Street soon looking to 2026 numbers – which very well could be too low given the signals Blackwell is already giving. At the moment, Nvidia is trading at just 30x 2026’s estimated earnings of $4.43, its cheapest bottom line valuation since shares were $95 in May 2024 – and Blackwell still holds the potential to drive quarterly revenue beats the same way Hopper has and with margins returning to Hopper’s highs. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper, and the I/O plans on keeping its members informed on what it sees ahead for Nvidia with frequent updates for members. With that in mind, here’s what the I/O Fund sees as 2024 ends and 2025 begins. Nvidia appears to be setting up for the next swing higher. As long as any further weakness holds over $116, this move should target between $165 - $173, with the potential to reach as high as $193. If this swing gets confirmed, it would likely be the final 5th wave in the historic uptrend that started in October of 2022. This does not mean that the technicals do not support significantly higher prices, it only means that Nvidia will first have to deal with a notable correction in both price and time before it sees those levels. The pattern off the October 2022 low developed as a classic 5 wave pattern. In early 2024 price went vertical. This was accompanied with max volume and peak momentum. This is the standard pattern seen in 3rd waves, and it tends to be the most powerful part of a 5 wave pattern. From the perspective of sentiment, this is the part of the trend where everyone realizes at once the direction of the trend. Shorts cover at the same time as the crowd buys, creating that standard pattern in 3rd waves. This would mean that the correction in June of 2024 was the 4th wave, and that this is likely in the final 5th wave higher. The sentiment pattern in 5th waves to new highs in price, but on lower momentum and lower volume, which is what is happening now. Nvidia appears to be setting up for the next swing higher. Zooming into the 4th wave correction that started in June of 2024 offers a better idea of the two potential paths that I am currently tracking. Zooming into the 4th wave correction that started in June of 2024 gives a better idea of the two ... [+] potential paths that I am currently tracking. · Blue – The final 5th wave is playing out as an ending diagonal pattern, which is common for 5th waves. This type of pattern is a 5 wave pattern in itself that is characterized with large swings in both directions. Our target zone for the bottom on this 4th wave is $126 - $116. If Nvidia can push over $140.75, then then odds favor this scenario. · Red – Nvidia is in a much more complex 4th wave. If this is playing out, NVDA would see the $116 level break, which opens the door to a potential low at $101, $90, or $78. One final point worth mentioning is how the broad semiconductor sector is performing in relation to the S&P 500. Semiconductors tend to be much more sensitive to the consumer, and economy than most sectors. For this reason, in periods of economic expansion, semiconductors tend to lead, outperforming the broad market. However, when this sector starts to move against the broad market, it tends to be a warning that volatility is ahead. In fact, every time that the semiconductor sector has made a lower high while the broad market made a higher high – i.e., semiconductors do not confirm the move higher – this preceded some period of volatility since the 2021 top. When semiconductors start to move against the broad market, it tends to be a warning that volatility ... [+] is ahead. This pattern can be seen going back to 2000 and consistently warned of weakness. As of now, this is one of the largest and longest periods of divergence between the semiconductor sector and the broad market on record. If the broader semiconductor sector stays below its July 2024 high, I would consider this a warning. This does not mean that I do not see potential upside, it only means that any long positions the I/O Fund takes will have strict targets at which we take gains and stops to protect us in case the market turns against us. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and it’s only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout. Nvidia has been our largest position for the last 4 years. The I/O Fund sent out nine buy alerts to our readers to buy this position below $20 in 2021 – 2022. The I/O Fund believes the future is bright for Nvidia, and believe the potential next swing is worth playing. However, with all the warning signs, any new long position will have strict risk controls until these warnings reset. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as potential buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Title: William O’Neil + Co. Investment Themes For 2025

2024 by any measure has been an extremely rewarding year for U.S. stock investors. Also, it has been a year dominated with big investment themes including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growing demand for electrical power in the U.S., the reassertion of Bitcoin and Crypto, the increasing usage of GLP-1 drugs and the rebuilding of U.S. infrastructure. As the year comes to an end, we want to look ahead to some of the possible major investment themes for 2025. These themes are from the research work by William O’Neil + Co.’s experienced equity analysts. Some of the themes are new and others are continuations of trends we saw in 2024. Themes: 1) Artificial Intelligence (AIQ) 2) Industrials: AI-Driven Demand for Data Center Infrastructure (DTCR) Key Stocks: 3) Energy - Rising Electricity Demand, Nuclear/Gas Demand to power Data Centers (RBLD) 4) Consumer - Selective Shoppers (PEJ) While inflation is easing, prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels and are likely to stay high or even increase under a potential second Trump Administration. As a result, U.S. shoppers are expected to maintain a selective spending approach focusing on purchases when they find the right products at reasonable prices. This selective spending behavior has created a clear divide between winners and losers in the consumer and retail space. Brands that resonate strongly with households earning over $100,000 continue to thrive. For instance, 75% of Walmart's market share gains last quarter came from households earning more than $100,000, contributing significantly to Walmart's stock performance in 2024. Other brands like Carvana, Cava, Sweetgreen, Sprouts, Warby Parker, On Holding, Royal Caribbean, and SharkNinja have emerged as leaders in their respective categories. Conversely, brands targeting lower-income consumers, such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Savers, have struggled. Similarly, brands like Nike and Lululemon, which have failed to captivate consumers due to a lack of innovation, have also lagged. 5) Internet - Video Ad Monetization (PNQI) Over the past two years, video streamers have introduced ad-supported tiers to capitalize on the shift in viewership and align with the growing migration of ad dollars to their platforms. As these platforms begin to scale in 2025, they are set to capture a larger share of ad spend. In 2019, linear TV captured 75% of U.S. video ad spend, with digital (including CTV) at 25%. By 2027, digital video ad spending is expected to surpass linear TV, presenting a $50B opportunity for CTV streaming to capitalize on linear TV’s decline. Additionally, the shifting of live sports rights to streaming will accelerate ad dollar migration. Among streamers, Netflix (NFLX), the only profitable pure-play platform, is a major beneficiary of cord cutting. Its advertising expansion emphasizes profitability over subscriber growth. Competitors like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA) are also prioritizing streaming profitability alongside subscriber growth. Pure-play digital video (e.g., social and short-form video) represents 8% of the ad market, with an 18% CAGR since 2019. It is projected to grow at a high-single-digit CAGR through 2028, benefiting platforms like Meta’s Reels (META) and Alphabet’s YouTube Shorts (GOOGL). Spotify’s (SPOT) venture into video is also noteworthy. Programmatic ad players like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) will benefit from increased video ad inventory across the digital and CTV landscape. In conclusion, while 2024 was an exciting and profitable year, William O’Neil + Co. believes 2025 can be as well. As such, we want to identify both themes from last year that can continue to perform in the new year as well as newly emerging themes that have a chance to produce large returns.

Stephen Yiu, portfolio manager of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, predicts Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will thrive in 2025 as the next Nvidia'. As Big Tech cuts dependency on a single supplier for artificial intelligence chips, Broadcom stands to gain immensely.Yiu pointed out that although firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia's (NVDA) graphics processing units, they are now creating proprietary AI chips to diversify vendors. "Broadcom is not Nvidia, but we would expect Broadcom to be the next Nvidia in terms of outperformance potential," Yiu said during Wednesday's Pro Talks on CNBC, stressing Broadcom's close relationship with big tech businesses.Driven by Broadcom's AI revenue growth of over 200% to $12.2 billion in 2024, its shares have surged upwards of 126% year-to-date and its market capitalization passed $1 trillion. Under the direction of CEO Hock Tan, the company is developing bespoke artificial intelligence processors for three main cloud computing customersidentified by analysts as Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance. By 2027 each is planned to have one million AI chips in clusters.Still among the top 10 holdings of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, Broadcom shows hope for future expansion in the evolving artificial intelligence scene.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks were mixed on Monday as investors considered the path of interest rates next year after the Fed hinted they would stay higher for longer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) erased early session gains to hug the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 250 points, or 0.6%. Wall Street is coming off an upbeat Friday but a downbeat — and volatile — week, with all three major averages up above 1% Friday but down around 2% for the week. The Fed is playing the part of the Grinch, signaling that it would step back its pace of cutting next year, leading stocks to one of the worst days of the year on Wednesday. On Friday, however, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed further cooling on the inflation front — if still some stickiness. Still, the lone dissenter of the Fed's move to cut last week said she voted against cutting rates because "there is more work to do on inflation." For now, according to the CME FedWatch tool, investors are betting on the Fed holding rates steady next month. For its subsequent meeting in March, bets are about 50-50 on a cut vs. a hold. But this week's light schedule will provide a bit of a breather and a chance for Wall Street to digest and reflect heading into 2025. Markets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, followed by Wednesday's Christmas holiday. Consumer Confidence expectations fell in December to 104.7, versus estimates for 113.2. The reading came in below all 47 estimates, which ranged from 109.3 to 116.00 across 47 estimates, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened mixed to kick off a short trading week as investors assess how the Federal Reserve will handle its interest rate policy next year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose slightly while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%. Consumer Discretionary stocks (XLY) gained while Financials (XLF) and Real Estate (XLRE) lagged in early trading. Individual movers included AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), up more than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Investors’ voracious appetite for all things Nvidia (NVDA) might have cooled slightly of late, but the chill is temporary and the feast itself has only just begun, according to one Wall Street semiconductor analyst. “I think some of these [issues] are growing pains,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi during an episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above, listen below). Shares of the market darling and Dow Jones Industrial Average component are down 5.72% in the past month. The Dow is down modestly in the past month, while the S&P 500 has tacked on a 0.5% gain. Added Arya, “Look at any of these large magnificent whatever stocks. Each one of them has gone through this soul-searching moment periodically.” That soul searching for Nvidia's stock, according to Arya, is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these are company-specific forces,” Arya said of the issues, “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's touted AI chip Blackwell hasn't been a seamless one, Arya explained, which has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” said Arya. Read more: Why Nvidia's Blackwell won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Product of the Year award Blackwell, which was rolled out in March at the company's annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. But bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Nvidia’s issues with mask and system-level configurations may be resolved, but “now we have a period of two quarters where it is very unlike Nvidia to have these question marks and where estimates have not gone up the way they were supposed to,” said Arya. Still, there is plenty of upside to Nvidia's stock long term, contends Arya. Wall Street more broadly would agree — Yahoo Finance data shows 94% of sell-side analysts rate Nvidia's stock at a Buy or Strong Buy. All eyes remain on the company as it makes more strides toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025. From there, “some of these gross margin issues will start resolving by the time the product is shipped for a quarter or two,” said Arya. Once they scale, “they are able to absorb a lot of those upfront costs.” When Blackwell rolls out, it is also expected to boost generative AI to help us go to the next generation, “more easily monetized,” said Arya, who cautions against thinking Nvidia is at its peak now. “It’s like saying the Apple App Store does not work before the App Store has even come on the phone,” he said.

Title: Apple could hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025

Time Published: 2024-12-23T13:20:00Z

Apple’s (AAPL+0.19%) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.” In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.” Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA+0.03%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.07%). Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025. Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year. While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest. Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years. That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said. “We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/22/retire-on-460k-in-2025-with-this-simple-7-fund-portfolio/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings On big down days for the stock market or prolonged stretches of sell-offs, it's good to have a trusted playbook. Think of it as a guide to keeping your sanity amidst the chaos and, hopefully, your portfolio flush with long-term gains. For me, the sell-off playbook is a twofold exercise honed over years of reporting on business news. First, chat up the smartest people I know in markets and business. What are they doing and saying, and why? Do they sound or look fearful? And two, think deeply on whether something truly has changed in the market or if investors are in a tizzy over splashy headlines. Suffice it to say, I had to dust off this sell-off playbook this week. The end assessment: Relax, folks, this isn't the start of a bear market even though the tape feels punishing. Why, you ask? A lot of the smartest people in the room, so to speak, have valid reasons to stay long on stocks AND the economy isn't falling off a cliff AND we are likely to still get rate cuts in 2025 AND we have a pro-business president in Trump taking office in less than a month. "Big picture, with record earnings, record profit margins, strong productivity, and overall improving consumer and small business sentiment, it is hard to think that this bull market is over," Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told me. Says Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner, "The bull market is still intact, but we are seeing a short-term gut check." A gut check, indeed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average promptly finished Wednesday's session down more than 1,100 points. It rallied slightly on Thursday, but the selling pressure renewed on Friday. The index of 30 well-known stocks such as Salesforce (CRM) and Disney (DIS) is off by almost 4% in December as losing stretches have begun to pile on one another amid renewed uncertainty on rate cuts. The S&P 500 is down 3% this month. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6% in December. What has spooked the markets is the Fed not committing to aggressive rate cutting in 2025. The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China. "I don't see many [economic] red flags. People are cautiously optimistic if they own businesses, whether they're small, medium, or large," San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. But again, nothing I heard from Daly suggested she is concerned about the demand outlook in the US despite inflation being stickier than she and other voting Fed members would like. "The Fed was hawkish but I think people are jumping the gun on assuming rate cuts are over — that’s not what Powell said (plus he just gave markets 100 bps of easing in 2024)," Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told me. "I do think 2025 could start a bit bumpy as Washington may be a bit dysfunctional (as we’re seeing now) and the Fed isn’t as dovish anymore, but I don’t think either are fatal to the bull market unless we see growth start to roll over." Then on the topic of demand, all signs point to an economy continuing to do quite well and supportive of strong earnings growth in 2025. Nike (NKE) called out double-digit percentage e-commerce growth this week for Black Friday on its earnings call. The latest retail sales report was strong. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff tells me he is securing new AI deals at a rapid clip, just weeks after announcing earnings. The AI thesis remains intact and will likely be a key driver of profits and valuation multiples in 2025. "There are strong indicators that this could be a tough year — and, potentially, decade — for the stock market. I’m going to be bold and say we will see the opposite. I have no doubt that AI will drive the stock market in both the short and long term. Countries that lead in AI will see the fastest GDP growth, as well as a significant improvement in standard of living and defense capabilities. And, whoever leads with AI as a company will lead in their industry, regardless of their sector," former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers flagged this week as one of his 2025 predictions. So, while things feel as if they have changed in the market this week, drill down and it looks similar to what has powered the gains in 2024. Nothing lasts forever, and stocks don't go up in a straight line — two phrases to live by in life and in investing. Three times each week, I drive insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia still top pick into 2025; MU, ORCL downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reaffirmed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a top stock pick for 2025, maintaining its Overweight rating and a price target of $166. Despite some near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in Hopper builds and staggered Blackwell product readiness, Morgan Stanley views these challenges as temporary. By the second half of 2025, the strength of Blackwell will be “the only topic,” the firm’s analysts stressed. Addressing competitive pressures from ASIC solutions, particularly from Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Morgan Stanley believes purchasing trends will favor GPUs over time. “While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year,” analysts noted. The report also highlights Nvidia’s $12 billion annual R&D investments as critical for maintaining its leadership in AI hardware and system-level innovations. Analysts also addressed the concerns over industry challenges, including scaling Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) clusters. While technologists advocate for larger AGI systems, financial backers remain cautious about return on investment (ROI). Nvidia’s innovations, such as Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and NV-Link, are positioned to improve efficiency in this area. Nvidia’s growth drivers—including inference, sovereign AI training, and enterprise applications—account for 70% of its data center revenue. Analysts believe these segments will continue driving growth even amid potential industry consolidation by 2026. “Even with some consolidation in the arms race, we should still see enduring growth potential,” they commented. The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2025 is expected to boost sentiment for Nvidia. Analysts anticipate the messaging will emphasize strong Blackwell demand, albeit with supply constraints. “But by mid year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell which will be the driving force behind revenue in 2h, potentially unlocking more significant upside,” the note concluded. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced an extraordinary rally since the U.S. election, solidifying its status as the market's "narrative king," according to analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC). The electric vehicle (EV) maker's shares have surged approximately 90%, adding about $730 billion to its market capitalization - a feat matched only by a few tech giants like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Barclays notes that this performance is particularly remarkable given the stock's apparent disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has soared from 80x before the election to an elevated 145x based on 2025 consensus EPS estimates. “The decoupling from fundamentals in many ways mirrors the rally we saw from Tesla in 2020-21," analysts led by Dan Levy said in a note. They attribute this rally to the "magnification of Tesla's narrative command," which centers around themes like autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI. Another factor contributing to the surge is the "Tesla-financial complex," where options activity amplifies stock movements. Moreover, retail investor interest remains robust, with 30% of Tesla's outstanding shares held by individual investors, according to Barclays. “Tesla remains the 'OG meme stock,'” the analysts emphasized. Barclays also pointed out the growth of the "Elon premium" in Tesla's valuation. The increased prominence of CEO Elon Musk has elevated interest in the company, translating to heightened enthusiasm for Tesla's stock. Bank of America (BofA) downgraded Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) to Neutral from Buy, citing a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin (GM) outlook for the second and third fiscal quarters. Shares of the chipmaker fell sharply Thursday after delivering disappointing Q2 guidance. Micron projects second-quarter revenue of approximately $7.9 billion, missing both BofA's $8.3 billion estimate and the consensus forecast of $9 billion. The company also expects a Q2 GM of 38.5%, below BofA's 40% estimate and the consensus of 41%. “Data center and HBM trends remain strong but weakness in PC and phone markets are putting downward pressure on memory pricing, especially in NAND,” BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya noted. Persistent pricing challenges in NAND are expected to extend into the third quarter. Although BofA remains optimistic about Micron's position in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and AI markets, it lowered its fiscal 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share estimates by 5% and 11%, respectively, to $6.80 and $8.78. The stock's price target was also cut to $110 from $125. “Historically the stock has struggled to outperform when GM expansion has remained muted, leading to our stock downgrade to Neutral from Buy, even though we still feel positive about MU’s position in the HBM/AI market where TAM was taken up +20% for CY25 to $30bn.” While data center and HBM trends are highlighted as strong, the weakness in PC and phone markets continues to weigh on memory pricing, particularly NAND. BofA does, however, see potential for recovery in these markets in the latter half of 2025. Monness, Crespi, and Hardt downgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Sell from Neutral, setting a 12-month price target of $130, implying over 22% upside from the current levels. The firm raised concerns about Oracle's valuation, rising competition, and aggressive capital expenditure (capex) plans. Oracle shares have climbed 60% year-to-date, largely driven by generative AI enthusiasm, marking their best performance since 1999. However, Monness analysts warned that "valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile." Oracle's recent Q2 earnings highlighted growth challenges, the firm noted. Its FY25 EPS estimate of $6.17 remains unchanged, while its FY25 Cloud Services revenue projection has been revised to $24.9 billion, down from last year’s $25.4 billion forecast. Monness expressed particular concern over Oracle’s “bold capex plans,” with spending expected to double in FY25. "Our current FY:25 capex projection of $14.2 billion represents 24.6% of revenue, up from 13% in FY:24, and well above the 27-year average of 4%," the analysts wrote. They argue this level of expenditure is unsustainable, dragging Oracle’s free cash flow (FCF) margin to an estimated 8% for FY25, far below its historical average of 28%. The firm also pointed to Oracle’s heavily leveraged balance sheet, with $88.6 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 86%. This restricts the company’s ability to boost shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks and limits its capacity for acquisitions or broader organic growth investments. While Oracle has seen early success in generative AI, Monness cautioned that "an inevitable shakeout in the LLM industry" and intensifying competition from major cloud providers could pose significant risks. Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and EV leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year.

"Breakthroughs in generative AI are bringing 3D perception, control, skill planning and intelligence to robots," Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president of omniverse and simulation technology, told CNBC. "Humanoid robots will help close the gap as labor shortages increase around the world, especially in sectors like retail, warehousing and distribution or manufacturing." Some analysts say there's a bigger market for these kinds of robots than for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. And while advancements in autonomy have driven up the share price of stocks such as Tesla, analysts suspect not much value has been priced in for the potential of humanoid robots, creating an opportunity for investors who want to bet on the emerging technology. Adding to the bull case, some think President-elect Donald Trump's expected deportation efforts could be another boon to automated labor. The best use cases are yet to be determined. While the adoption of humanoid robots could pick up rapidly in factories, RBC analyst Tom Narayan sees the big upside coming from when — and if — humanoid robots can be part of a consumer's everyday life. The real opportunity is in "more than just cutting vegetables," he said. "I think the majority of the value [in humanoid robotics] is not on the industrial side. ... It would have to be on the consumer side, like in people's houses — like a personal assistant to help raise your kids or babysit," Narayan said in an interview. "In most manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example, robots are already working. If you look at auto, most of those plants are already largely automated." Predictions already anticipate massive sales, but Wall Street's estimates are wide-ranging: Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas anticipates humanoid robots will be a multidecade, trillion-dollar opportunity largely because the adoption curve could accelerate faster than for autonomous cars on public roads. Far more capital will be pumped into the humanoids given the thousands of repetitive and dangerous human tasks that could be made significantly easier with robots being incorporated into factory lines, warehouses and kitchens, Jonas wrote in a September note to clients. "The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable," Morgan Stanley equity strategists Edward Stanley and Matias Ovrum wrote in a recent note. "The number of catalyst events is on the rise, and we expect U.S. workers to begin being substituted from 2030 onwards." Just a few publicly traded companies are looking to meet this need. Many are electric vehicle makers with AI skills. XPeng, Nvidia, Tesla and Xiaomi are at the forefront and could be major long-term beneficiaries, Morgan Stanley and Goldman analysts said. There's also a slew of hot startups. XPeng, a Chinese auto giant, is poised to capture "the next AI megatrend," according to Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao. The company's AI Technology Day in early November gave investors a peek at how far humanoids have come. Its second-generation humanoid robot Iron is integrated into XPeng's factories and stores and uses XPeng's own chips to operate its more than 60 joints and 200 degrees of freedom with technology shared from its AI vehicles, XPeng said. A leader in humanoid robots, XPeng's first-generation PX5 was released in October 2023. After the event, Hsaio reiterated an overweight rating and raised his price target by $6 to $17, which implies more than 33% potential upside from Friday's close. Shares have fallen more than 14% this year, hurt by China's economic growth struggles and concerns that growing EV competition will pressure auto sales. However, Hsiao said XPeng has a strong vehicle pipeline, established smart driving capabilities, and an enriched ecosystem of humanoids and other products, such as its eVTOL multicopter aircraft. "XPeng shares offer superior risk-reward among major EV start-ups," Hsaio wrote in a Nov. 6 note to clients. "To rival increasing tech entrants, XPeng's investment in embodied AI via autonomous driving and humanoids will be continuous." Xiaomi is another Chinese company that's been tackling humanoid robots, Morgan Stanley said. Its shares have rallied roughly 94% year to date. Xiaomi first announced its CyberOne humanoid in 2022, unveiling a robot that it said was capable of perceiving three-dimensional space and recognizing individuals and expressions in its environment. CyberOne also has characteristics of a human friend — as it is able to recognize dozens of classifications of human emotion, the company said at the time of release. "CyberOne is able to detect happiness, and even comfort the user in times of sadness," it said. The Chinese humanoid industry has received substantial government support that's led the country to produce "some of the most advanced humanoids revealed to date," Morgan Stanley's Jonas said. China — the world's largest car manufacturer and biggest car market — is, by far, also the top robot market in the world, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Policymakers have recently been pushing the technology as a way to further industrialize and grow the country's struggling economy, which is also facing a population crisis. China's Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday that local government officials in China have released robotics policies and unveiled a plan, which will run until 2029, promoting the innovation and deployment of humanoid robots. According to Citi, China has accounted for 78% of all robotics patents over the past two decades. Closer to home, Tesla is a big player with the ear of the incoming Trump administration, which could open the door to more support of the emerging industry and accelerate the company's robotics developments to help it compete with rivals in China. Tesla's ambitions in the space have become one of the biggest talking points behind the company's long-term growth forecasts, particularly as it struggles to sustain its domestic EV market share. "While we see some fundamental headwinds to the core auto business over the near to medium term, we also believe the stock could remain at a higher multiple to reflect the long-term opportunity tied to [full-self driving]/robotics given broader market interest in potential AI beneficiaries," Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a Dec. 3 note to clients. Pockets of Wall Street are still deciding how to value Tesla's grandiose robotics visions. The company first revealed its ambitions to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event. However, its Optimus robots, seen folding laundry in a demo video earlier this year, were criticized for being operated by humans using controls, rather than acting autonomously. CEO Elon Musk hasn't been clear on Optimus' capabilities, but claimed in June that its humanoid robots could eventually boost Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion. Tesla's shares have popped about 46% over the past month, largely because of Musk's close ties with Trump. Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu recently reiterated his buy rating on the stock, saying the incoming administration could drive increased support for Tesla's humanoid robotics. "Beyond attributing the price action to tactical factors, we see potential large terminal value benefits to Tesla's efforts in auto, robotaxi, and even humanoid robotics," Yu wrote in a Nov. 12 note. Yu said the Trump administration could back the development of a supply chain that could support the industrialization of humanoid robots, which he said would need to be produced at a large scale and low cost. That could look similar to the federal support given to the semiconductor industry, he said. Trump's expected hard-line immigration policies could also eventually "lead to a smaller pool of cheap labor, thereby favoring more investment in automation," he added. Many are still in wait-and-see territory, meanwhile. RBC's Narayan is waiting to see how Tesla's humanoid robot efforts will be deployed and applied in the real world and has valued humanoid robots at just $5 of his $313 price target on Tesla stock. He remains bullish on Tesla's progress in autonomy, particularly with its robotaxis and full self-driving technology, which account for most of his valuation. "Tesla ... has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. To me, for humanoid robots to be a big contributor to that, it would be on the consumer side. And I currently don't include that just because I don't know what that looks like," Narayan said. Macquarie and Morgan Stanley remain enthusiastic that Tesla, like XPeng, has its own in-house manufacturing plants for its humanoid robots, which could help cut costs. But Morgan Stanley is similarly holding back on attaching the technology to its Tesla price target, as its $500 bull case on the company values its humanoid business at exactly $0. Nvidia is a clear AI play, but investors are keeping an eye on its expansion into robotics, where the chipmaker focuses on providing the brains behind the robot. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers' bull case on Nvidia predicts that the company's Omniverse robotics business could offer additional upside. Several companies racing to make humanoid robots are using Nvidia's Project GR00T model, which was announced in March. Nvidia also announced a supercomputer called Jetson Thor earlier this year for deploying into humanoid robots. GR00T — or Generalist Robot 00 Technology — is a platform for developing humanoid robotics and includes foundation models, data capture and generation pipelines as well as robot simulation tools, Nvidia's Lebaredian told CNBC. The company is working on several GR00T models, including ones for robot motion, whole-body control and multimodal sensing. Lebaredian said XPeng, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics and Skild are among the humanoid robot makers currently developing on Nvidia's robotics platforms. "Humanoid robots are an ideal general-purpose embodiment because the world is built for humans — stairs, tools, shelving, kitchens, and workcells — and more," Lebaredian said. Sentiment around humanoid robotics appears to agree on one thing: Humanoids could make everyday life easier, and therefore more advanced. "What many people really want is help with mundane tasks, such as cleaning, so they can do more thinking, art, and leisure. AI robots can help with this utopian angle," Rob Garlick, Citi Global Insights head of technology and innovation, said in a note to clients this month. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: A risky corner of the ETF market has boomed this year as YOLO traders chase the rally

While the stock market was an early frontier of the gambling craze that gripped America in 2024, investors have driven a boom in a relatively new kind of investment product that can amplify gains — and losses — in a single name. Enter leveraged single-stock exchange-traded funds. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, ETFs have been groundbreaking in offering the characteristics of a mutual fund — owning a basket of diversified stocks — but offering the daily trading liquidity of a single stock. But even after 30 years, the humble ETF is seeing fresh updates that cater to investors with a strong appetite for risk. Instead of owning a basket of stocks, single-stock ETFs track the price of one stock, which the fund will try to juice returns on by levering up. "These are vehicles that mass retail has never had the ability to trade before, until now," Todd Sohn, an ETF specialist at Strategas told Business Insider. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF seeks to deliver double the move of Nvidia's daily price fluctuations. On Friday, Nvidia stock jumped about 2.5% amid a broader market rebound, while shares of the 2x Nvidia ETF returned nearly 5%. Year-to-date, the 2x Nvidia ETF is up 346%, compared to a 170% gain for the stock. "Traders are looking to implement high-conviction ideas through them," Sohn said. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into these funds, making for some highly successful ETF launches in recent months. That 2x Nvidia ETF has attracted more than $5 billion in assets, while other popular leveraged ETFs tracking stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase have each attracted well over $1 billion in assets. That's a big deal for the ETF space, where the breakeven point for most ETF products is around $50 million in assets, according to white-label ETF provider Alpha Architect. Year-to-date, more than 60 ETFs have launched catering to single-stocks, attracting a combined $23 billion in assets, according to data provided by Sohn. While that amounts to relative peanuts in the $10 trillion universe of ETFs, it's still notable, and the funds are seeing a lot of use. "They do pop up quite often on the most traded ETFs list," Sohn said, adding that ETFs linked to Nvidia, Tesla, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy are the most popular. But while they can deliver outsize returns, these investment vehicles are inherently risky, much more so than owning the underlying stock. Sohn said that leveraged ETFs are incredibly volatile, and due to options decay, they're best used as a trading vehicle, "not a set it and forget it vehicle," Sohn said. Options decay refers to the idea that, even if the underlying stock trades sideways, the leveraged ETFs would likely move lower as options expire with zero value and new contracts are purchased. And the leveraged downside tied to these ETFs can be painful. During Nvidia's summer correction, the 2x long Nvidia ETF lost about 63%, prompting concern from Redditors who invested. "Now I've lost a ton on NVDL (not touching my NVDA) and I am trying to think what makes the most sense," a Redditor said in a post on the Nvidia subreddit earlier this year. Another example is MicroStrategy stock, which is down about 33% from its late November peak, while the 2x ETF that tracks the stock is down more than 60% over the same period. The trading craze recalls another popular recent high-risk investment trend—the zero-day option. The contracts are a bet on the single-day move in a stock, with the option expiring the same day a trader buys it. The market took off during the pandemic trading boom, and it got so big that JPMorgan warned last year that its popularity could spark bouts of volatility in the broader market. But for now, the risks appear to be limited to the individual traders who are buying them and not the broader market. "While single-stock leveraged ETFs have gained in popularity this year, they remain relatively small in size. For example, NVDL has $5.5 billion in assets and NVIDIA is a $3 trillion stock," Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at TMX VettaFi, told Business Insider. Going forward, risk-on traders seem less concerned about the risks associated with the single-stock ETFs and more focused on which one will take off next. "The next questions is… what name catches on next with the trading crowd? Palantir seems to be one candidate (and has 2x ETFs out there). But we'll see what else comes up," Sohn said.
