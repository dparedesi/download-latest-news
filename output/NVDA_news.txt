Nvidia (NVDA) has had a bumpy start of 2025. Share price of the A.I. chip giant surged to record highs at the beginning of the year and then fell sharply in late January after the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley. Now, analysts are eagerly anticipating Nvidia’s fourth-quarter and 2024 financial results, set to release tomorrow (Feb. 26), to gauge its actual position in the A.I. race. Nvidia is the world’s second most valuable public company with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion, meaning its earnings report could also have major implications for the broader stock market.

You can opt out anytime. Wall Street expects Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to soar 72 percent to $38 billion and profit to jump 64 percent to $19.6 billion. But to keep its share price on an upward trajectory, the company might have to do even better. To avoid a sell-off, Nvidia must meet its “normal exceed,” Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, told Fortune. While DeepSeek’s cost-efficient breakthrough initially led investors to believe demand for A.I. chips could fall, some analysts have pushed back on such fears. “We believe that A.I. GPU demand still exceeds supply, so while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this A.I. ‘gold rush,’” said Brian Colello, a Morningstar analyst, in a January note. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek in a recent interview for “making everybody take notice” of opportunities for more efficient A.I. models. While the initial market response suggested Wall Street was losing faith in compute investments, Huang claimed “it’s exactly the opposite,” given the “fairly compute-intensive” nature of reasoning-focused models like DeepSeek’s R1. But Nvidia stock took another hit on Feb. 21, falling 4 percent after the investment bank TD Cowen reported that Microsoft has cancelled leases for at least two data center operators. The news sparked concerns over a decline in demand for A.I. compute. “It points to a potential oversupply position,” said TD Cowen analysts in the report. In response, Microsoft noted that it is “well positioned” to meet increasing demand but may “strategically pace or adjust” its infrastructure in some areas. Nvidia’s earnings come amid a broader market downturn. Last week, major indexes saw their worst day this year so far in response to weaker-than-expected economic reports on the U.S. services sector and consumer sentiment. But when it comes to A.I., tech bulls are confident that Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will put an end to Wall Street’s caution. While the market is “heavily skewed negative right now around tech sentiment,” Nvidia’s upcoming performance should “calm the nerves of investors,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a client note. Updates on Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip and demand from Big Tech clients will continue to fuel optimism towards the technology, Ives added. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to spend more than $300 billion cumulatively this year on A.I. efforts, including buying Nvidia chips. “After speaking with many enterprise A.I. customers, we have not seen one A.I. enterprise slow down or change,” said Ives, who added that no clients want to “lose their place in line” for Nvidia’s next-gen chips. During Nvidia’s last earnings call in November, Huang noted that Blackwell production was “in full steam.” The success of Nvidia’s transition to its next-gen GPUs will be closely watched when the company reports earnings tomorrow. “All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary,” according to Hans Mosemann, an analyst with Rosenblatt who predicts that Huang will reaffirm that demand for shipments remains high throughout 2025. “We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger [second half].” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Wall Street eyes 'growing pains' in Nvidia earnings but all eyes are on a bullish 2nd half for its next-gen chip

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: Nvidia earnings have analysts optimistic the DeepSeek selloff was just a blip

As Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-1.70%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+2.27%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+0.40%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY+2.45%), Alibaba (BABA+3.93%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+1.31%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC-0.46%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG-3.74%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-3.39%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+2.01%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD-0.37%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+10.67%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR+0.94%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000.

Title: Nvidia investors' call gives the chip giant a chance to tell backers why they're wrong about DeepSeek's impact

When Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, the chip giant will have the chance to tell investors why it thinks their intense reaction to the rise of DeepSeek was a mistake — or change the subject entirely. Heading into 2025, Nvidia's rule looked unassailable as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and others lined up for its chips. Then the Chinese startup DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model with benchmark results to rival OpenAI's o1 model. Critically, R1 was said to be produced with fewer and less powerful chips than o1. "DeepSeek's remarkable feat has shaken the industry's assumptions about how much capital or GPU chips a company needs to stay ahead of the competition," Barclays analysts wrote last month. Though Nvidia has largely recovered from markets' reaction to DeepSeek — the chip firm lost $600 billion in market capitalization in one day, in the biggest single drop in US market history — CEO Jensen Huang will need to show investors that the party is nowhere near over and that the promise of AI isn't overhyped. Huang previewed his argument at a virtual event broadcast Thursday, where he said investors had misinterpreted the signals of DeepSeek. As Nvidia prepares to address investors officially for the first time since the DeepSeek saga, here's what to look out for in its earnings. Analysts predict that Nvidia's revenue, especially in its all-important data center business, will keep rising — bolstered by coming data center buildouts. Nvidia's customers are still lining up. OpenAI's Stargate project is expected to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US. Meta has forecast an additional $65 billion in spending on data centers this year. And Amazon recently forecast spending $100 billion on computing power. It will offer Nvidia fresh evidence to present to investors concerned that DeepSeek's claim to use chips more efficiently — a key driver in lowering costs — would hurt demand. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed 'revolutionary' optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors in early February. Model improvements are another favorable piece of evidence for Nvidia. Grok 3, xAI's latest model, has received praise for its performance. Musk's firms also recently collaborated on a second data center with roughly 12,000 Nvidia GPUs, Business Insider exclusively reported. Musk has been aggressively adding to the fleet of GPU-packed data centers supporting Grok, suggesting a link between progress and infrastructure. Morgan Stanley analysts told investors in a note last week that model builders and hyperscalers still had their eyes on artificial general intelligence and that cheaper, highly functional models like DeepSeek wouldn't affect that pursuit. Nvidia's latest and most powerful chip series, Blackwell, has struggled with a slow rollout due to manufacturing and overheating issues. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to report a strong ramp-up. "Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters," Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, said in an investor note last week. UBS's Timothy Arcuri wrote that after much consternation, investor fears of a botched rollout were relaxing, and strong sales numbers could put them fully at ease. UBS analysts also said the fourth quarter was the last in which Blackwell chips wouldn't make up the majority of Nvidia's GPU sales. Investors are likely to favor that shift because Blackwell brings with it higher profit margins. Nvidia's buzzy GTC conference is set to take place in San Jose, California, next month, marking the first anniversary of Blackwell's debut. Further growth in inference demand would also be a point for Huang's theory of investor error surrounding the DeepSeek rout. Demand for inference, the process of using and improving models once they've been trained, increases when consumers and businesses find value in AI tools. Investors will likely want to see the share of AI workloads continue to shift to inference, which also requires GPUs to run. On the company's latest call, in November, Huang repeatedly said inference across Nvidia's platforms was growing. Growth in the software layers of Nvidia's tech stack would be a good sign, too. This would suggest maturity in AI products and lend strength to a part of its business that's potentially even more difficult to compete with than the chips themselves. "What Nvidia talks about on its long-term moats and its possible deployment on the AI application side probably matters more this time," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Investors will also be looking for any signals from Nvidia about the company's approach to China as President Donald Trump threatens to upend business relations with the country. Just before the end of his term, President Joe Biden initiated new regulations, now in a 120-day comment period, on the export of high-powered chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Many policy analysts expect Trump to allow the rules to take effect, as they align with his "America First" agenda, though Trump hasn't directly addressed them. Trump last month described AI leadership as critical to ensuring "economic and national security." Last month, Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, the home of Nvidia's chip manufacturing partner, TSMC. Tariffs could lead to increased costs for Nvidia. Huang met with the president at the White House last month, but neither party provided details of the discussion. Though Nvidia's share price has recovered much of its DeepSeek-induced losses, the $3 trillion juggernaut faces various headwinds. Huang's job on Wednesday will be to reassure investors that those headwinds will be mild and reaffirm that Nvidia remains fundamental to the AI story. Jump to

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

The company will likely continue to report robust demand for its products and a compelling outlook. The stock is likely to pop - per our data on how Nvidia reacts post earnings. However, there is a larger risk to the US economy, worth factoring right now. What is that? See more on Trefis.com Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia. When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table. NVDA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 3 economic downturns. Inflation Shock (Jan 2022 to May 2023) • NVDA stock fell 66% from a high of $33 on 19 November 2021 to $11 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-inflation shock peak by 25 May 2023 - taking 154 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 317 days • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and currently trades at around $135. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. • NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days. • During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover.

Title: Nvidia earnings are coming. Here's what to expect after the DeepSeek shock

Nvidia (NVDA+3.34%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO+4.30%) and Micron (MU+4.21%) also gained. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-1.70%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+0.62%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF+1.31%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

(Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock?
