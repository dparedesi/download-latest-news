Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Title: Nvidia has finally won over one of its biggest Wall Street bears

It seems that Nvidia's success is too great for one of Wall Street's biggest bears to ignore. In an update to clients, DA Davidson raised its rating on Nvidia stock from "neutral" to "buy" and raised its price target from $195 to $210 a share. That implies around 18% upside from current levels. It also reflects a sharp change in sentiment from what the firm has previously said about the stock, with analysts predicting as much as a 48% drop in March. "Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA," analysts led by Gil Luria, the firm's head of technology research, wrote. In the past, Luria and his team warned that spending from hyperscalers—mega-cap tech firms that are shelling out billions to further their AI ambitions—could peak in 2026, which could significantly impact Nvidia's business. The use cases for AI also need to be more significant to justify how much money comapnies are pouring into Nvidia, they added. But things have changed over the last six months. In a note shortly after Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, Luria said the firm's perspective on the stock had "shifted quite a bit" over the past half-year, thanks to the rapid development and adoption of AI among companies. Hyperscaler spending, meanwhile, doesn't look to be nearing a peak. "It does mean that the most important thing—the overwhelming growth in demand for compute—is the only thing that matters," Luria and other analysts wrote. "NVIDIA should be able to sustain growth over the next two years, regardless of which segment that growth comes from," he added. The majority of Wall Street analysts have issued "buy" ratings on Nvidia, even considering the stock's record-breaking run-up over the last several years. The AI chipmaker is up 32% year-to-date. Luria's team, though, said they would continue to keep an eye on several "cross-currents" they saw potentially working against the stock. Here are some of the factors on their radar: Jump to

Title: The AI Trade Picks Up Steam After Oracle's 'Truly Historic' Quarter

Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:56:32Z

The artificial intelligence trade got a shot of adrenaline on Wednesday after results from database software and cloud provider Oracle suggested the AI spending bonanza has ample room to run. Oracle (ORCL) on Tuesday reported its backlog swelled to $455 billion, a 359% year-over-year increase, after it signed four multibillion-dollar cloud deals in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. Executives said the backlog is expected to surpass half a trillion as Oracle inks more big deals in the coming months. Oracle also forecast cloud revenue would grow from an estimated $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion in 2030, about $50 billion more than Wall Street had forecast. Oracle said most of that revenue forecast was already reflected in its backlog, giving some investors greater confidence in the numbers. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had signed a five-year contract worth $300 billion with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle’s projections completely overshadowed lackluster first-quarter results, and sent its shares soaring as much as 43% on Wednesday. The rising tide of robust AI spending was lifting plenty of boats on Wednesday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were recently up more than 4% and 9%, respectively, while chip design company Arm Holdings (ARM) surged more than 8%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) was up about 2%. Data center infrastructure provider Vertiv Holdings (VRT) jumped about 9%, while power generators Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) advanced 8% and 6%, respectively. Oracle’s major cloud competitors were the only drag on the AI trade on Wednesday. Amazon (AMZN) declined more than 3%, while Meta Platforms (META) dropped nearly 2%. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) ticked higher. Wall Street’s ebullience over the results was first visible on Oracle’s earnings call Tuesday night. “Even I’m sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward,” said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci at the top of the question and answer portion of the call. “I tell my team, ‘Pay attention to this’—even those that are not working on Oracle—‘because this is a career event happening right now,” DiFucci added. “There's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick. Others called the quarter “momentous” and the backlog growth “truly historic.” AI investments have been driven by what many have characterized as insatiable demand for training and inference, and Oracle’s results appeared to support that assessment. On Oracle’s earnings call, co-founder and chair Larry Ellison said an unnamed company had requested all of Oracle’s available inferencing capacity. “I’d never gotten a call like that,” Ellison said. Big Tech’s investment in capacity to meet that demand is expected to remain robust in the coming years, supported by healthy cash flows at the biggest cloud providers and supportive tax incentives. Cloud providers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have been key drivers of the AI infrastructure trade in recent years. Hyperscalers are expected to spend a cumulative $368 billion on infrastructure this year, with much of that earmarked for data centers and the chips and servers that fill them, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle on Tuesday forecast capital expenditures of $35 billion in the 12 months through May 2026, about $10 billion more than the figure executives gave as a minimum last quarter. Tax incentives written into the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act should also support AI infrastructure investment. Morgan Stanley expects the bill’s immediate capital investment depreciation provisions to boost Big Tech’s free cash flows by nearly $50 billion this year. The firm expects a sizable portion of those tax savings to be spent on AI infrastructure.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.
