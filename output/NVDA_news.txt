The gloom that has hung over Wall Street in recent weeks showed signs of dissipating on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up about 2.4% in recent trading, leading the major indexes higher after lagging during Friday’s rally. Big tech shares and many of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks were among Monday’s top gainers, with chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) each up more than 7% and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the green. Dip-buying retail investors may be partly responsible. Money poured into S&P 500 exchange-traded funds last week while the index slumped, according to a UBS note, while ETF inflows as a percent of assets under management climbed to their highest level this year—both signs, the analysts wrote, of individual-investor optimism. And inflows into leveraged funds accelerated throughout the sell-off, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, another potential sign of retail's confidence. There are signs of improving investor sentiment, particularly among retail investors, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Retail investor behavior often reflects market sentiment, or vibes, as they usually lack the detailed market data and sophisticated algorithms of institutional investors. Sentiment is itself one of the main drivers of stock market returns. Stocks sold off last week as concerns about an AI bubble and uncertainty about the trajectory of monetary policy weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 lost nearly 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%. Equity positioning turned underweight—indicating caution—for the first time since July, according to Deutsche Bank. Chief among investors’ concerns was whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Signs of a weakening labor market argue for a cut, while evidence that inflation is accelerating well above the Fed's 2% target could drive caution. Rate-cut expectations jumped all over the place last week. The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.

Investing Bernstein, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still one of the top stocks to own, according to analysts at Bernstein. The firm, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Remember, NVDA just posted EPS of $1.30, which beat estimates by four cents. Revenue of $57 billion, up 62.5% year over year, beat by $1.91 billion. Data center revenue of $51.2 billion was up 25% quarter over quarter, and up 66% year over year. Analysts only expected NVDA to post EPS of $1.25 on $54.83 billion in sales, which would be a 56% jump year over year. Moving forward, Nvidia expects to generate $65 billion in revenue, which would be above expectations of $61.98 billion. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. In most years, Amazon is a no-brainer stock to buy and hold for the holiday rush. In fact, except for 2022, the e-commerce giant has historically pushed higher heading into the holidays, which we expect to happen again this year. Part of the reason for that is that, according to Adobe Analytics: Also, analysts at BMO just upgraded MP Materials (NYSE: MP) to an outperform rating, noting that the dip is a buying opportunity. Remember, with China’s tight control over rare earths and U.S. demand soaring, rare earth stocks are again center stage. And, as noted by CNBC, “Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.” All of which is fueling upside in MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass mine in California. Two, the U.S. Department of Defense announced it was buying $400 million worth of MP’s preferred stock – positioning itself as the company’s biggest shareholder. And three, MP signed a $500 million deal with Apple, which agreed to buy rare earth magnets from it.

Title: AMD to raise graphics card prices by at least 10% in 2026 — price surge attributed to ongoing AI-related DRAM supply crisis

Rising memory prices blamed as GPUs look set to become more expensive in 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After weeks of hints and speculation, it's now (almost) official: AMD has told its supply partners that it will raise graphics cards prices by at least 10% in the new-year due to rising memory prices, as per analyst Dan Nystedt (via UDN). This is reportedly the second time AMD has raised its prices in recent months, though the first was kept internal and just ate into AMD's margins. This time though, it's passing it on to the partners, who will in turn pass it on to consumers. AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025 The subject of graphics card pricing has been a contentious one for a number of years now. Prices and power draw have risen generation upon generation, and cryptocurrency-induced shortages have occasionally spiked demand and the cost of a new GPU in turn. 2025 started with something similar, though that seemed to be more down to deliberately constrained supply — or perhaps a shift of Nvidia and AMD's focus to AI. That's only become more apparent throughout the year, and as data centers the world over ate up GPUs, CPUs, memory, storage, and anything else they could get their hands on (including entire power plants), prices for most components have risen in turn. None quite so much as memory, though, which has jumped close to 200% per stick in recent months, and that shortage is now making its way into other industries: most notably, graphics cards. PowerColor recently warned that GPU price rises were coming, and AMD seems to have now confirmed it to its suppliers and board partners. In the translated text, UDN's sources claim it'll be by at least 10%, suggesting that could be the floor of AMD's potential price rises. However, Mr Nystedt suggests that 10% is the figure, so we'll have to wait and see how it shakes out or for an official announcement from AMD, to know for sure. This is unfortunate timing for AMD which has struggled to get the price of its flagship RX 9070 XT even close to its recommended retail price throughout the year. It just managed it this week, hitting $599 for the first-time since release as part of Black Friday. But that seems likely to be incredibly short-lived. Not least because that's a decent deal for a great graphics card. AMD is unlikely to be alone in its GPU prices rises either. Nvidia is expected to have delayed the launch of an RTX 50 Super series of graphics cards because of memory shortages, and unlikely to lose profit on its graphics cards when selling to gamers since it makes so much selling them to data center developers. If you're keen to get ahead of the price rises and want to buy a graphics card before the end of the year, here's our list of the best graphics cards out there right now.

I am going to classify it as a cartoon. Pat, you may have just resolved the question of how best to view / assess AI visuals of all types for me (and everyone?).

For another example of ‘good’ AI: A. Inventions They’re obvious (deliberately so) AI generated images. Be sure to read the texts. (found on Tim Bray’s Long Links) 100% Not designated as such on Twitter. Grok asked 2x and the answer is no. Another person in replies said this was staged, as in trained dogs. FB Reels has a LOT of videos of that pit bull doing horrible (so to speak) things to that chihuahua. Gonna vote with the AI crowd. Or call the SPCA. ;-) Seems like something “Gain of Function” would do. The cat video, otoh, demonstrates the sense of humor of the domestic feline. Like a stand up comedian the cat keeps checking the audience reaction to its performance. That’s how you know the earth isn’t flat: if it were the cats would have pushed everything off it by now. “Putin on the 28 Points” There is no way that Putin is going to treat those 28 points as the final plan but will consider them a basis of negotiations though Trump may have other ideas. And as the negotiations continue, the Russian military are setting up new realities on the ground by taking the Ukraine fortress belt. In one “version” of that 28 point plan, the unoccupied part of the Donbass would be not only turned into a DMZ but that Russia would lease that territory from the Ukrainians. A few weeks more and it will be a moot point as the Russian military will take it all back – and more. Funny thing is that Trump is demanding that Zelensky accept that plan by Thanksgiving as if it was the final version. And to put pressure on him, he has threatened to cut of weapons and intel from the Ukraine. If I was Zelensky I would call Trump’s bluff and refuse to sign it. That way if the Ukraine starts to collapse, the Neocons, the Ukrainians and the Europeans will put all the blame on Trump for losing the Ukraine which is the last thing he wants.

A supplier for a company I once woked at developed an optical component under NDA and applied for a patent behind our backs. A year or so later our customers started getting sued for using said component in their products, even though it was agreed in writing that we would have a royalty free and assignable license to the technology developed. Rather than deal with the legal issues, our customers shifted to another technology from overseas. A 9-figure revenue loss. “The Patent Office Is About To Make Bad Patents Untouchable” Truly a gift of immense importance to corporate (and individual) Luddites in whose interests it is to prevent innovatiion by others and enables then to get great rents on the IP they own. Once again, a US institution gives the future away to China, Russia and the other BRICS countries, and enables the US economy to go down the tube even faster than Germany. God bless America. Yes, true The article points out that patent trolls will still exist regardless and that the review process has only existed since 2013. Many including Dean Baker and Cory Doctorow have pointed out that the problems with our Intellectual Property regime are way bigger than the proposed change. In movie world patents had a lot to do with the existence of Hollywood since zealous enforcement of basic patents on the movie camera caused early filmmakers to flee the NY area to California in order to use their “pirated” machines (CA weather also had something to do with it). Doctorow says that unreasonable IP enforcement does indeed lead to “piracy, the obvious choice” among the public if less among money making corporations that can be more easily sued. Working link for “G20 countries’ medium-term growth to be weakest since 2009 crisis, IMF says Reuters” article at- https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/g20-countries-medium-term-growth-be-weakest-since-2009-crisis-imf-says-2025-11-19/ I would suggest that some members of the G20 are having better economies than others. G20 countries like Argentina, France, Germany and the UK would be having a rough time of it while G20 countries like Russia and China would be coping better. The FT article on the German economy contains at least one memory hole: Another frequent scapegoat is the price of energy. There is no doubt that Germany was hard hit by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to turn off the taps on gas supplies to Europe in 2022 (and not to fill up Germany’s reservoirs in the autumn of 2021). But everyone in Europe suffered from the resulting energy crisis. Did Germany suffer a greater blow? The only problem with that FT article is that Russia never turned off the gas but it was European countries which cut the gas off themselves. But to avoid the blame for doing so, they made up the legend that Putindidit. US export of LNG skyrocketed in summer/fall 2022! (per US DoE EIA) Running around 6 million barrels per day equivalent measure since then. US importing some crude needs, but LNG exports give 2 to 3 million barrel a day export surplus. A lot of axolotls: the amphibian-themed banknote Mexicans don’t want to spend Guardian ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ With a design including Diego Rivera as an added bonus! It’s a rare vertical oriented banknote too, never see that~ How money looks is a good barometer to how a country is faring, our paper money is largely unchanged since 1929 and frankly horrid looking, with the insipid $10 sporting a red torch that bears no reason to be there, aside from an afterthought of doing an anti-counterfeiting measure. (color copiers can’t pick up certain color combos) Since the Lydians came up with the idea of coined money some 2,500+ years ago, artistry waxes & wanes, here’s a variety of Ancient Greek coins of the highest artistry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetradrachm About 1,000 years later, this is what coins looked like in the Dark Ages just after the fall of the Roman Empire, and the artistry only declined from then on for 500 more years. https://www.vcoins.com/en/coins/world/germanicdark_ages-583.aspx Our paper money was quite beautiful once upon a time, with the 1896 Educational Series even sporting a little bit of nudity on the $5 banknote! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_Series “Banned in Boston” The naked breasts of the female figures on the $5 silver certificate reportedly caused some minor controversy when several Boston society ladies took offense to the design. Some bankers reportedly refused to accept the notes in transactions, and the term “banned in Boston” allegedly originates from the $5 silver certificate Bermuda’s paper currency gives Mexico’s axolotl a run for its money. I have a few bills saved from trips there. Beautiful, but does it have a naked woman riding a shark on a $3 bill? https://www.mintageworld.com/media/detail/11608-cook-islands-ina-and-the-shark-3-dollars/ Looks like peak Pre-Raphaelite. Record-breaking November heat blankets the South…link didn’t work for me. But there’s this, from 2024: https://thebamabuzz.com/noaa-reports-alabama-experienced-warmest-november-ever-recorded/ Ahhh, Coming for Your Burrata. Is it time for the national conversation on U.S. narcissism? The article is a reminder of the DJG Axiom about Writing by Anglos about the Mediterranean World >> It is almost always inaccurate, and most Anglo writing about Italy is just plain wrong. (A notable exception — and another reason for reading Naked Capitalism — is Conor Gallagher, who always runs down details and gets them in line.) Observations, dairy-related: –Burrata is something of a fad, like “cacio e pepe,” which went from being a Roman favorite to a supposedly national dish. Except that I have almost never seen it here in the Undisclosed Region. –Puglia has always had very hot and dry summers. I am not trying to discount climate change, the effects of which are readily seen in much of Italy, mainly as excessive warming. Patience Gray in her wonderful Honey from a Weed has some vivid descriptions of Puglia in summer, rainless, preternaturally bright, and hot. –For these reasons, the farmers in the article are bravely challenging some problems with weather and climate. In most of Italy south of Roma, the main milk producers are sheep, buffalo, and goats. All of these animals tolerate heat better. –In Sicily, the main producers of milk have been the sheep and goats. According to Mary Taylor Simeti, in her definitive Pomp and Sustenance, there was no (bovine) dairy in Sicily before the early 1800s, when one was established because of royals exiled from Napoli during the Napoleonic invasions. –Buffalo is still highly regarded in Italy, as are sheep and goats. U.S. farmers might learn something, but U.S. agriculture is locked into mono-cropping, and animal husbandry consists of growing animals too fast and slaughtering them too young. –Here in the Undisclosed Region, some producers still send their cows up to higher pastures in the Alps during spring and summer. Special cheeses are made during the “alpeggio.” Then the cows come down in the fall, during celebrations, with the cows all dolled up in flower crowns and wearing big bells. The seasonality of milk is widely understood in Italy. –The article is worth reading for the typical Italian meticulousness and care. Italians are extremely serious about food production, and the article does give a glimpse of how intense the process can be. (By the way, buffalo-milk mozzarella is often considered the real mozzarella.) –There is a rather sly producer here in the Undisclosed Region who is making camembert from buffalo milk. The cheese is grand. (Don’t tell the French.) U.S. agriculture is too industrialized. The lesson of the article is that U.S. farmers and eaters should take a step back and try to rescue the U.S. countryside, now overwhelmed with unsellable soybeans, corn being made into syrup, and cattle feedlots with thousands of sick cows making sick milk. “U.S. agriculture is too industrialized. The lesson of the article is that U.S. farmers and eaters should take a step back and try to rescue the U.S. countryside, now overwhelmed with unsellable soybeans, corn being made into syrup, and cattle feedlots with thousands of sick cows making sick milk.” Some of us try to get the point across, but the “farmers” in Georgia think it is there purpose and right to produce, not farm, soybeans and feed corn on thousand-acre plots. The state legislature is all-in on the grift. There are precious few who do not go along but their lights don’t go out, so there is hope. As for Americans being serious about food…Ha! In addition to not understanding the seasonality of milk, Americans have no clue about the taste of milk from different breeds of cows and the wonderful taste of buffalo milk. Holsteins produce vast quantities of inferior tasting milk that is made even worse by the crap diet the cows are fed to stimulate max production. Crap tasting industrial milk is all that’s available to most Americans. There are some efforts. There is an alpine breed of cows in France called Tarentaise whose milk makes a very nice cheese. An artisanal cheesemaker in Vermont wanted to try to replicate it in the US and approached my family’s farm several years ago thinking their herd would be a good match. They milked Jerseys, but pastured on a terrain similar to that in France. My family agreed to supply the milk for their Tarentaise cheese , which they did for several years. But even with the cheesemaker paying them substantially over the going rate for their high quality milk, they couldn’t make a go of it as a small farm and sold the herd a few years ago. Its like some people have completely forgotten or never aware of the Green Revolution of one Norman Borlaug. For all the laurels bestowed on him, he ushered in the Corporate Ag/Food Industry Cabal. For the increase in yields there is a very long and broad list of cons off setting them. Of note is the need to buy seed from monopolies, cross pollination IP dramas [see Mexico currently], petro-chem [waves at DuPont (better living through chemicals ads lmmao) – short list. The deal is industry sets the standards based on a balance sheet and flow of funds first and foremost for the benefit of a few. On the petro-chem I remember an old doco about some banned Herbicide in the U.S. which by law was supposed to be destroyed. Wellie the Mfg found it more profitable to ship it to Mexico and be used there. Clear evidence of it being improperly stored [little wooden shacks and leaking], handling, and worst of all … poor farmer families lived right next to the fields where it was sprayed whilst the kids were playing et al – its a neurotoxin. So a experiment was undertaken to judge the cognitive effects between the farm children and say children living at a higher elevation in the same region. Basically the kids on the farm were like zombies compared to the kids at higher elevation, things like rocking up with a red balloon and their reactions, kids running up to greet them, instigating spontaneous play between themselves, all of it. Sorta like Dick Cheney’s [bless his dear deported soul] mate getting help to sell a byproduct as an artificial sweetener till real world effects were cropping up. Not that background toxicity like CO2 has gone parabolic and lest we forget man made neurotoxins/psychotropics. Add Covid into the mix and the gaslighting to dump down the public is a trifecta of human stoopid[tm]. Thank you! Indeed…The food pyramid is a production schedule… Ditto KLG … Food-serious Americans buy serious food from companies like Anson Mills. https://ansonmills.com/biographies Food-serious Americans pay to keep serious food artisanality alive here and there. And food-serious Americans with back yards at least are also learning serious-food gardening in order to grow themselves some serious quality fruits and vegetables grown without petrochemical cancer juice. Any thoughts on why MTG is resigning? being a Congressperson is no fun if you’re in the minority. even worse as a blacklisted-majority. No big conspiracy. if MTg was smart, she’d leverage her (niche) fame into being a pundit I have to admit to feeling very sad about this. Someone finally shows some grit and a spark, and it gets extinguished like a fire after someone throws a pail of piss on it. Without her the Freedom caucus is a joke. I’m sure Lindsey Graham is celebrating, and Liz Cheney too. Maybe. There are too many unknowns here. Remember when Tucker Carslon got the sack from his network, only to come roaring back with his own independent one that is now a major factor in its own right? I don’t think that MTG is just one to fade off into the distance but will come back in one form or another. Time will tell. Yes, I was quite surprised, and saddened because she was one of the most visible critics of the Trump administration from the “MAGA” ranks. She gave a number of possible reasons for resigning in her statement. Whatever one thinks of MTG’s past actions or present motives, the statement itself is quite good: https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/marjorie-taylor-greene-savages-trump-130834004.html I can’t immediately find the written version. Hard to argue with much of that. Apparently there are few in congress with balls her size. I don’t think you should imply that MTG, who is a woman, has big balls. Besides, men have owned that phrase for a long time and women should get their own phrase. Perhaps, we could say she has a big pair of ovaries but I don’t want to catch hell for interfering. Policing other readers’ tone is not on. Please don’t do so. And I as a woman, I would take that as high praise. IMHO, the issue here is that most billionaires that IM Doc and his colleagues have treated have had genital-enhancing surgery, both the balls and the penis. So I would be more concerned about this sort of remark reinforcing equipment size fetishism. It was high praise just to be clear. Thank you! She has what many of her colleagues don’t. “genital-enhancing surgery”. What?! Is this true? Don’t the oligarchs know that “it’s not how long you make it, it’s how you make it long”? (No apologies to Winston). If the rumors are true, Elon not only had surgery but it went very wrong leaving him unfunctional. Sometimes it’s better not to take the risk and leave well enough alone. ;) (Also further proof money can’t buy you everything.) I am told additionally that many can no longer have vaginal intercourse as a result (not that they can’t get hard, but the stiffened member is not receptacle-friendly). But at their level, it’s the balance sheet and not the performance that is presumed to pleasure their sex partner. Like her or not, MTG was providing critical, vocal observations on the hypocrisies evident in Trump policies when held to the America First maxim. She will be missed. I agree. I watched her farewell video. Best line: “Congress shouldn’t be a lifelong career, or an assisted living facility.” https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/marjorie-taylor-greene-savages-trump-130834004.html 1. She said in effect that she didn’t want to have to fight a bare-knucle battle to win in the primary (which she should win, she had big margins in her past elections) and then be in a House that would probably be controlled by Democrats and have to defend Trump v. the expected impeachment. 2. There was speculation she would run for the Senate or Governor but she said no. But plenty of time to draft her later and have her gracefully accept. 3. IIRC one of the threats against her was versus a family member….her son? That would also focus the mind. I think her turnaround is genuine and comes from personal growth, but I have been fooled before. Still, it happens, especially with someone who is not of the Swamp. She would win her primary without breaking a sweat, but defending Trump in the aftermath would be too much to take given that she has finally seen up close and personal what kind of man he is. The backlash against Trump among her constituents because of his attacks – Marjorie Traitor Greene – will be measurable. They are likely to take it personally, and this makes GOP candidate appeals to their Trump bona fides a perilous tactic outside of the Blue urban areas of Georgia. I’m going with #2. The current GOP candidates for US Senator are unimpressive in the extreme, but it may be too late for that. And I cannot see her being subservient to Lindsay Graham. Governor is a definite possibility, though. Georgia is flush right now and she would be unlikely to mess that up. She would also be less inclined to pay attention to the supplicants under the Gold Dome. A definite plus. She had no problem with the beat down of the two GOP Public Service Commissioners earlier this month. They lived in the pockets of Georgia Power Company and everyone knows that. #3 certainly would have pushed her to make this decision. If this comes out, the perps will be cast into the outer darkness in perpetuity. She is still young. Enough time to come back. Besides there are still Rubio, Vance, perhaps Tulsi (and some others). How far could she make it with those in charge? Credible death threats Imagine. Two of the issues that she is most vocal on are Epstein and Gaza, and they both are critical for the current Israeli regime. I hear the Charlie Kirk was killed for his nascent anti-Zionism theme often on the street here in the North American Deep South. I now think that the Zionist Elites have overreached. American public opinion is now firmly anti-Zionist here down South. What the Zionists either fail to understand or do not care about is that this anti-Zionism will easily change into full blown anti-semitism. Expect to see the return of pogroms, popular pogroms. One ultra-conspirational theory is that the Globalist elites will divert the public’s anger about the deteriorating conditions of the average Terran human’s standard of living from them to the Jews. My inner cynic can easily see this happening. Some may counter argue that many of the Globalist elite are Jewish. Hannah Arendt showed clearly in her analysis of the Holocaust in “Eichman in Jerusalem” that the high status Jewish elites sold out the low status Jews to insure their personal survival. Thus, it follows that the Jewish Globalists will sell out the lower status Jews to preserve their power. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. God’s Chosen People™. Blood is thicker than water, it is the Almighty at play for sure. But thickest of all is the Almighty dollar. “[…] the high status Jewish elites sold out the low status Jews to insure their personal survival. Thus, it follows that the Jewish Globalists will sell out the lower status Jews to preserve their power.” In other words: it is all about class — the concept that should never, ever be mentioned in polite society. This is something that the Jewish “bundists” had already understood: they found irremediably suspect the idea of emigrating to Palestine in order to establish colonies there, on land bought through grants paid by, and travel expenses subsidized by the same ultra-rich Jewish capitalists who, at home, where exploiting them and their non-Jewish comrades without any moral compunction. Of course, zionists hated the bundists. One hopes the lower status Jews have enough guns and ammo to make the “popular pogromists” pay for their “popular pogroms”. The problem here is that most if not all “resistance” movements require a “vanguard” cadre to guide and “enlighten” the downtrodden masses. The degree of “kinetic capability” is almost irrelevant here. This is why the “thought leaders” of emerging movements are usually “liquidated” to ameliorate the nascent threat to the status quo. I place Charlie Kirk firmly within this category. Alas, despite the fondest wishes of so many, proper revolutions are not “crowdsourced.” Also of note is that most pogroms from the past were “officially” approved. The status quo elites view such eruptions of popular anger as not only social pressure relief valves, but also opportunities for personal profit through seizures of goods formerly belonging to the dispossessed. When you worship at the altar of Mammon, all else falls away, morals, ethics, restraint. Stay safe. …she wanted it to coincide with the assassination of JFK? I think she reached the pinnacle of politics as ugly as it stands presently in these not so united states, with only a downward spiral to look forward to as the feckless Donkey Show wins in a year by default-not by ability. p.s. M T-G has come a long way… In light of 8/10’s of an inch of rain @ Burning Man in 2023, she stated that said deluge was divine punishment… “God has a way of making sure everyone knows who God is”. Although I was there for the Rx possibilities, great art and the best vibe ever shared by 75,000 others, she pegged me… “probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all of it” and that after they dispersed, they would “have these stories to tell about how terrible this is and how we have to do everything possible to stop climate change” I am going to honor her spark and backbone by assuming she has been sincere. In that case, it must be a crushing disappointment to have the hero she fought so hard for turn out to be a turncoat. She doesn’t want to be treated like a battered wife. Thanks for all of the replies. My hope is that her final act will be the reading of the names from the Epstein files on the House floor. just FYI: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rich-marjorie-taylor-greene-123013554.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/rich-marjorie-taylor-greene-123013554.html Greene’s financial journey is as unconventional as her political career. Since joining Congress in 2021, her net worth has skyrocketed, jumping from around $700,000 to as much as $25 million. As of October 2025, Marjorie Taylor Greene’s estimated net worth is approximately $25 million, which marks a significant increase from before she took office. IMO she should have stuck it out for the rest of her term. She’d have been a useful gadfly even as a lame duck. Now the GOP governor will have to call for a special election in her district, and that person will hold office until the next rep wins a general election and is sworn in a year from Jan 2026. That means another headache for Mike Johnson, as technically his majority will drop to one vote after she leaves. That makes Massie the GOP equivalent of Joe Manchin. Not a bad parting shot at the Swamp Stooge Speaker. Depending on state election law, special elections can be really difficult to handicap. Special election is how Repub Djou got elected to Congress in deep blue Hawaii. Antidic: My thoughts are THANK YOU GOD!! She voted for every Trump initiative he put forward. She is one of the main causes of the mess we are in. Now if the rest of MAGA resigns, the country might just survive. Also, IIRC, didn’t MTG threaten AOC (implying that she had a gun in her purse while yelling at her walking down the street)? I can’t find the video right now. Please correct me if I am wrong on this. When someone criticizes the Zios, I listen, and maybe stand with them, though they may leave out some crucial fundamentals. Otherwise it’s an open field. She did, and so she was a target. Make no mistake, the Zios are absolutely ruthless. I’m waiting to hear from AOC. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/22/marjorie-taylor-greene-political-reactions Some Republicans offered congresswoman plaudits, but AOC was scathing in her dismissal of her frequent sparring partner Any critique of the Zios? Still waiting. Yeah, it’s a bit odd to see many lefties reaction to this. I can only relate it to when Dick Cheney suddenly became part of McResistance. In both instances, Trump became a bridge too far but the rest of the package seems the same. Quit while you’re ahead. She can come back to electoral politics another day but right now she’s looking good and can bank that. The coming year+ will be much less fun and quite risky for her. Damn man, there is something about resilc’s snow clearing in Vermont that is both relaxing and mesmerizing. It’s like those people that put video cameras on trains and you follow their journey as if you were at the front of that train. Well done, resilc. The video is about snow clearing in the Austrian Alps… It is even spoken (not much) in German. Thanks. Couldn’t hear the words as sound is busted on my ‘puter right now. I still find it relaxing. The flags on either side of the snowplow engine hood are a give away that it’s probably a state or county snowplow. Those flags aren’t US or Vermont./ ;) They also aren’t flags or any European country I know of (and look like reverse Austrian flag with proportions off), so they may just be markers of the edges of plow used as help in navigating narrow areas. ;) good point. thanks. Von Trapp family still have their ski lodge in VT, complete with Austrian flags…. ;) Video title says it’s from the John Deere co. about snow clearing in the Alps. The Green Mountains are in Vermont. The Green Mountains are a subrange of Appalachian Mountains. Vermont snowplowing probably looks exactly like this. / ;) From Cold Pursuit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DoGlTEzy4Q Cold Pursuit is a remake of In Order of Disappearance, IMHO a better version with Stellan Skarsrgard, one of my favorite actors, in the lead role. The original version is definitely a better film. The bit at the end with the snow plow and the paraglider is laugh out loud sad funny. Skarsrgard had the father character down cold. Angry, determined and melancholy all at once. Sequoia NP has a Pisten Bully that dates from before the end of the century that’s used on the odd occasion snow surveyors need to get into Mineral King to measure up, and too boucoup of a base for snowmobiles to tread. I rode it once for about 9 miles of the hydraulic arms on either side schluffing off 5 feet feet of snow as if it twas nothing, the operator at the gimbal stick of a steering wheel, precisely pushing it to the proper place. And then we turned around and did it again by cleaning up the road’s act down to the snow-mo’s waiting for riders. I had to look up Piston Bully on utube to see what kind of machine moved so much snow. wow! Probably a little to big for my driveway. / :) Please read with more care. This site is about critical thinking :-) The video is clearly labeled as from the Alps. I said resilc had a farm in Vermont. I never said the video was from or of Vermont. Presumably he hearts having snow plowed. “Raising taxes on the ultrarich” By all means tax the rich in every way listed here, but for family blog’s sake can we just PLEASE stop arguing for it “because revenues?” This just contributes to the pernicious framing that “money grows on rich people” and that we somehow need them! Stop the self-harm! Yes, we need the tax system to be seen to be just, and yes we need to tax the rich in order to prevent them from “buying” our legislatures, but NO! We do NOT “need” either them nor their money! Gaaaah!!! 🤦‍♂️ Whatabout taxing them because climate change? We do NOT “need” either them nor their money! From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs. Sorry if someone else has already noted this (I have had trouble keeping up with all of the comments over the past few days) but NC got a nice shout out on Philip Pilkington and Andrew Collingwood’s “Multipolarity” podcast on Thursday — in this case in particular for coverage of events in Mexico. Re AI–I’m a fan of the Hudson/Wolff/Nima transcripts and toward the end of this one they say that Youtube vandals are taking their videos and manipulating the visuals with AI and earning money off the content. The manipulators haven’t yet started putting other words in their mouths but could be the script kiddies find faking intelligent conversation harder to do than playing with pixels. https://michael-hudson.com/2025/11/cowboy-capitalism-in-central-asia/ There’s loads of this kinda stuff on YT now. I first noticed it with Whitney Webb clips being repurposed for Crypto (and now just Whitney Webb “fan accounts” with AI visuals). I have heard fake audio for Alan Watts. I was fooled for about 5 minutes until “AI-lan” started talking about doom-scrolling which seemed several years ahead of it’s time ;) “Less water from glaciers during future megadroughts in the Southern Andes’ Wouldn’t be the first time something like this has happened. About 4,200 years ago a severe drought forced the population to leave the ancient city of Caral in Peru and to disperse to places where they could still feed their people. This mega drought, known as 4.2ka, may have also struck such far off regions such as Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley as well as other places- https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/05/archaeologists-discover-how-oldest-american-civilisation-survived-a-climate-catastrophe Re the Border Patrol and “predictive surveillance” didn’t know this The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. Of course they also like to be obvious and visible as in those required traffic exits on New Mexico and Texas interstates where you will be given the “papers please” treatment if you or your vehicle look at all suspicious. (I’ve been getting the wave through–so far. They do ask “are you a US citizen?”) Here in Oz at least you can get stickers that you can stick onto your rear window saying ‘Baby On Board.’ Maybe there will be a market with similar stickers saying ‘US Citizen On Board’ In yet another chapter of the mutual Bizarro World collapses of the USSR & USA… You couldn’t travel internally in the USSR without a passport or the correct papers (please give personal remembrances in this regard oh so reliable NC Russian relations of a certain age) when one was free as a bird to go where they wanted in the USA, with the only state crossing tale of oh! being the old-timey tale of a criminal who eludes capture by evading the law in merely going over the border, where for some reason the other state couldn’t touch him. Old way of detaining somebody: ‘I tracked you for about a mile doing 77 in a 65’ New way of detaining somebody: ‘the license plate reader shows that you go drive this road a lot, which is very suspicious, and also it indicates you’re into kinky amputee porn.’ Yes in the good old days it was only the Texas sheriff speed traps you had to worry about. Our most recent sheriff was into setting up drug dragnets out on the interstate and seizing large amounts of cash which by (his) definition must be drug dealer money. Then it turned out he was using the county credit card for personal use and was therefore a crook. Karma is a bitch. Oddly no jail time for him–just the boot and reputational jail time. He did confess all in court. My favorite trap ever was some road off of the Hume Highway, the main artery between Melbourne and Sydney. I was too young to rent a car circa 1982, so I bought a 1968 Renault 10 with windows that went sideways and not up and down like every other car. It faithfully got me to and fro a few times, and this one time I went that different way I was talking about, and all of the sudden the blacktop ended and you were on a dirt road doing about 40 mph per hour too close to the car in front of you, and I didn’t take it for granite, more igneous, but a stone the size of a large walnut shattered my windscreen and for the next mile had to drive with my head looking out to the right, when I got to a town of about 1,000 people, with 8 windscreen stores. I’d imagined schoolchildren were sent out on field trips to plant the just right sized rocks on the roadway, ha ha Ah, license plate readers…. It’s not like the license plate reader computer OCR (Optical Character Reader) chip could glitch, could get things wrong, could never make a mistake. Is it? Of course not. I mean, it’s a computer! They never glitch or make mistakes, right? (do a really need to add the snark tag here? ha.) And, yes, Flock feeds to ICE. From Benn Jordan. (Note: the scary deep-voiced narration in certain parts is entirely for satirical purposes, though the satire is dark.) utube: ~35 minutes. Breaking The Creepy AI in Police Cameras https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9MwZkHiMQ Also remembering, huge numbers of new ICE hires with very little experience have been hired this year. How many of these stops are ‘training exercises’ for the new hires? What could go wrong? Brazil (1985, Terry Gilliam) – Mistake? Haha. We don’t make mistakes. Tuttle changed to Buttle, and wrong person apprehended. Having been on the wrong side of the NYPD as they fabricated a story to protect one of theirs, I think about this. I am fortunate now to live in a county where the sheriff with large city SWAT experience thinks No-Knock entries are stupid/risky and prefers actual policework to be done. Thank you! I started to watch Brazil some years ago*, but then did not, I will soon. *Brasil, it had such a broader understanding, there were disputes on several in DVD ending offerings. I had a long battle with the tollway authority over a mis-read license plate. I sold my car, and didn’t buy a new one so the plate wasn’t transferred. 6 mos later, I get a nasty letter from the tollway about unpaid tolls for the car/plate I no longer own. Long story short (many calls and letters and “fixes” that only worked temporarily), there was a car with my old license plate, except it had an F where my plate had an E. The other car also had a license plate frame that encroached into the bottom of the plate that apparently caused the reader to see an E rather than an F. Yes, this is the technology I want to involved in “pre-crime” decisions. – ‘Trump SWOONS Over Zohran in Surreal Oval Office Presser’ – Breaking News Surreal is the word! Every time I think Trumpworld could not possibly get any more bizarre, I am proven wrong. I urge those who have not actually watched the Trump-Mamdani press conference to take a look. He bullies Marjorie Taylor Greene out of office and then turns around and loves-up the Commie Jihadist from NYC. WTAF is going on? Two general observations, Mamdani evidently has serious political instincts and skills. Trump displayed one of his most potent skills, throwing everyone off balance, misdirecting focus. I’m imagining a NY Post headline, Trump tosses MTG overboard, adopts Zohran as son he always wanted, hah, who believes that? Did Trump play to a pre designed kid glove strategy? “Mamdani evidently has serious political instincts and skills.” If I thought Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was brilliant before (and I did) he’s more than confirmed it now. All the mainstream commentators are talking about how Mamdani “charmed” the President—as if he whipped out an invitation to yet another state visit to Windsor Castle or something—but, while he undoubtedly did do that, he came with a strategy laser-focused to appeal to Trump (e.g., building more housing units in New York). The press is dopily talking about the “bromance” between the two men, which reduces everything down to a lazy Hollywood trope, but, while Trump is obviously taken with Mamdani, I’m positive that Mamdani knows exactly who and what he’s dealing with. So Mamdani, in a stunning coup, at a minimum, neutralized the threat to New York City and his administration coming from the federal government (at least for now), threw a wrench into the plans of the Republicans to run against “communist,” “jihadist” Democrats in 2026, and, as an added bonus, made those who refused to endorse him before the election look petty and short-sighted and those in the House who, just before the meeting, were “resolving” to condemn “socialism”—a few being in both groups—look hysterical. It doesn’t get much better in politics, at least in terms of optics, than that. Thanks. Those “resolving” democrats deserve a mountain of scorn, and should be roundly criticized. Classy lot are they. But they also confirm what team blue thinks about Mamdani (and socialism), not that we didn’t already know. This is classic Trump. Be super dooper nice and flattering, then make unreasonable demands, then claim hurt and betrayal when he doesn’t get what he wants. Then he’ll lash out to demonstrate how dangerous it is to oppose him. Bang goes the bromance. I agree. I believe it is Trump that is doing the “charming”. I’ll venture Mamdani is well aware. Maybe a little “enemy of my enemies is my friend” (at least for now). I always remind those who infantilize Trump that you don’t successfully build skyscrapers around the world (navigate city and state bureaucracy, labor unions, mob, environmentalists etc) by being the oaf you play on TV. I mean he’s obviously not book smart and has the vocabulary of a 7th grader, but he’s got some other skills. Yea, he got those New York mafia skills. It turns out they don’t translate well to Moscow, Beijing, or Pyongyang. “Corporation Pumping Soothing Gas Into New York Subway Station” Not really a fan of this idea as you are talking about a corporation doing this in a public place with no opt out. Did they use those CIA studies about diffusing gases in subways as an inspiration? Bath & Body Works may be pumping vanilla and fresh pine scent from diffusers but how long till other people get ideas about what can also be pumped into the air in such places. Pax, here we come- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-NVs68X_S4 (2:01 mins) The 2005 sci-fi movie Serenity is worth watching in this regard (and so many others). ‘The Pax’ is the very first thing that came to my mind as well. “In a year, ten, they’ll come back around to the idea that they can make us ‘better.’ And I do not hold to that.” To me, It’s so worth watching I bought the box set! artificial fragrances have not been proven safe, nor have they been proven unsafe. there are some studies that suggest that certain cleaning chemicals raise lung cancer odds. Precautionary principle should apply….but of course won’t, cuz peeps love the smell of artificial vanilla Aum Shinrikyo is the first thing I think of when you mentioned pumping gas into subway stations. Re: “Dead or impeached by mid 27 and removed.” I know this (or some variation thereof) is the fantasy of many, but be very careful of what you wish for. Booting DJT means that Vance will become president, and he is both a) significantly smarter than DJT, and b) has actual backing and support from the likes of Thiel and crew. The views of his wife are immaterial, just as Melania’s are. If DJT’s own party operatives manage to remove him, they will make sure to do it after he’s served 2 years and 1 day, so Vance would be eligible to be in power for a maximum of 8 more years after his ascendance in the current term. I’m convinced they’re working from a long-term strategic plan, something the Dems seem to be unable to manage. re: nukes & fiction Apparently Jeffrey Lewis of all people in 2018 published a novel about a nuclear attack by North Korea on the US (this guy really had spoons full of this irresponsible nonsense), “The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States”. In 2025, DRPK has significantly improved it weapons and delivery potential, quality and quantity. I read the short book it interested me because of the duties I performed from 1972 to 1983 in SAC and Air Defense Command. Later, civilian work in US military sensor and command and control projects. The only complaint I can recall is he did not say whether the blasts were air or surface bursts. Otherwise, given the leaks of western missile defense demonstrated in Israel and Kiev I find little fault. It was mercifully brief. 400 tomahawks in the hands of Tokyo will be meaningless. “Nuclear War” by Annie Jacobsen is similar in theme. I haven’t read the Lewis material but sounds like tone too. It’s an interesting read and goes through US (and other) responses from 0.4s to 72min post-launch. – ‘Mike Huckabee Held Meeting With Jonathan Pollard, Who Spied on the US for Israel’ – Antiwar (resilc) Not surprising in an administration where “MIGA” always trumps “MAGA.” And this applies even more to Huckabee, for whom “MIGA” is a prerequisite for the Second Coming. I was puzzled by this statement though: “Pollard described the meeting as “friendly” and told Israeli media that he thanked Huckabee for aiding in the effort to secure his release from prison.” Did Huckabee actually aid in Pollard’s release? I clicked on the Times of Israel links and did not find any information on this issue. Couldn’t they have met for coffee or hummus in some little café instead of in the embassy? That sounds like Bibi’s way of putting the boot in. (…with apologies to Joseph Welch) Have you no sense of indecency, sir, at long last? “Putting Venezuela Into Perspective… A Massive Challenge Compared to Iraq, While Russian Offensive Picks Up Steam” ‘Venezuela is covered with triple-canopy jungle and mountains. These geographic features make it easy for insurgents to hide and carryout deadly ambushes. Second, and related to the first, are the porous borders with Brazil and Colombia… Insurgents can move easily across these borders and obtain resupply.’ I tell you. I am definitely getting Vietnam vibes here if Trump is idiot enough to send in an invasion force. They might have the troops to control the capital and the oil fields but the rest would be enemy territory and the resistance would be fierce. It reminds me of the Darian Scheme, the first ‘Faraway Bubble’. (Mississippi Scheme and South Sea bubbles being the others) A good chunk of Scotland’s wealth went into the Darian Scheme in the 1690’s investing in what sounds very much like a Venezuelan jungle motif. When it went bust, the scheme was a prime reason for Scotland’s union with the UK in 1707. The Darien scheme was an unsuccessful attempt, backed largely by investors of the Kingdom of Scotland, to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia or Britain-in-Panama, a colony in the Darién Gap on the territory of present-day Panama, in the late 1690s. The plan was for the colony, located on the Gulf of Darién, to establish and manage an overland route to connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme It depends if the goal is to really take over the country as a functioning entity, or if it’s merely to steal some of Venezuela’s oil, put a puppet government in Caracas, and otherwise destroy the country (including any people who might be insurgents because they are, you know, leading a goat or a donkey along a country lane instead of driving a Cybertruck or a Humvee on a highway). How much did it cost Obama to destroy Libya as a country just to show the world who’s boss? Trump would use the same math I would guess. Are there any logisticians telling Hegseth: “you can’t get there and supply it, from the east coast”? Distances, Roosevelt Roads is hosting F-35’s. It is 850 km or so from Caracas! That is about two aerial refueling going and at least one coming! Gerry Ford can launch around 20 strike sorties per day until the EMAG catapults die. Maybe lots of tomahawks! Drone warfare has interest but flying around the triple C! A US army brigade, currently the large maneuver organization, with organic logistics, requires a container port with roll on roll off facilities. Useable if US had sufficient Ro-Ro ships and loading capacity on east coast! A lot of ton supply per day! Just getting stuff to a suitable port on the east coast may be a problem. Are there airfield to fly tons and tones into Venezuela? Will US wear out the C-17’s and C-5’s. I was a 22 year old 2nd LT when that monster was new! Most POL for the 3000 vehicles per Brigade would be shipped by tanker to a port (?) and distributed how? A Marine Expeditionary Unit, with about a quarter the rifles of an army brigade, needs three large “landing ships” and a cargo fleet to supply once ashore. But are there suitable beaches to deliver the 21st century John Waynes/Smedley Butlers? Vietnam war was from the beginning a multi-year business plan. The Vietnam surge to take off required building a huge port at Camh Rahn Bay to augment deliveries to port of Saigon! Iraq logistics infrastructure was kept lukewarm from Desert Storm days! Is there a port for large material in Venezuela? The logistics! Trump will order them to perform D(onald)-day landing, and then build floating (Cranberry) harbours, just like in the movie he saw. H. CON. RES. 58 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION HOUSE PASSES REP. SALAZAR’S RESOLUTION DENOUNCING THE HORRORS OF SOCIALISM That Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States. (I think it outlines in the now USA that, we have socialism under monopolistic capitalism..so why not denounce that…but that besides the point) and then after this I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting Guardian (Kevin W) Trump SWOONS Over Zohran in Surreal Oval Office Presser Breaking News So Trump pulls another…I tell you something that appears to go one direction while, knowing he has backing to drive the knife into Zohran from the house. “The United States is both a democracy and a republic, as both terms refer to forms of government in which supreme power resides in the citizens. The word __republic_ refers specifically to a government in which those citizens elect representatives who govern according to the law. The word democracy can refer to this same kind of representational government, also called a representative democracy, or it can refer instead to what is also called a direct democracy, in which the citizens themselves participate in the act of governing directly by voting for all laws, policies, decisions, etc.” – Merriam Webster “The real danger of socialism,” Lange wrote, in italics, “is that of a bureaucratization of economic life.” But he took away the force of the remark by adding, without italics, “Unfortunately, we do not see how the same or even greater danger can be averted under monopolistic capitalism” (Lange and Taylor 1938, pp. 109–110). “Whereas President Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, “To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it”; Sponsor: Rep.

RES. 58 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION “Whereas President James Madison, the “Father of the Constitution”, wrote that it “is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest” IMHO, we have legislated (enacted) seizures (the corrupting influence of big money) by a class of citizens (united)/ “”aristocracy of moneyed corporations” who, through financial manipulation have disposesed millions of their personnal life safety and personal liberty. That House – Financial Services – that being the one place most concentrated in folks representing FIRE sector interests and tax policy to benefit the FIRE sector – just figures they would come up with this neoliberal distortion of Madison and Jefferson Just keeps the drips brewing for an complete privitization of all things at the public expense – the socialist aristocracy of moneyed corporations during the first bernie run, when i got unwittingly pulled into beinga teabilly whisperer and evangelist for a new new deal in the dern feed store parking lot…when they’d say, “but hes a soshulist!”(ref my bernie sticker), and i’d first ask them to define that word, and counter everything they falsely attributed to it with an example from our corporate and federal masters(including property taxes, as far as never actually ownig anything…which sent them into confused silence) then i talked about actually existing socialist structures they used every day:highways and streets and county roads that belong to all of us…the ISD that not only babysits and teaches their kids, but employs more people than any other entity in this county, the city(2nd largest employer), the county(3rd,lol)… and if they were old enough, medicare, social security…VA benefits and healthcare…and so on. the dern volunteer fire department? lol. but then bernie got shivved, and trump came a blusterin in, and all was forgotten for a while. i dont go among the mundanes near enough any more for a repeat of all of that. but i do overhear that the local lumpenrighties are not very happy with trump, et alia.

The claim he has ended 8 wars, his direct threats to reporters and networks and his congenial meet and greet with Mamdani in a short time are not the actions of a stable genius.

Title: JPMorgan Has 15 Ideas for 'Bargain Hunting' Tech Stock Investors

Is it time to start buying tech stocks again? JPMorgan says so, with analysts telling clients in a note Thursday—a day after Nvidia's (NVDA) blockbuster earnings hit markets—that it could be time to go "bargain hunting" among the shares of hardware and networking companies that have taken big hits in recent weeks amid worries about an AI bubble. The analysts listed 15 stocks particularly exposed to AI that they believe represent the biggest bargains, with the most "overblown" risk already priced in, and strong fundamentals that could leave them poised for big gains. Most of the stocks JPMorgan recommends have declined between around 10% to 30% from their highs of the last four weeks, with one down nearly 40%, and one off just about 5%. Here are the analysts' ideas. Tech stocks have pulled back in recent weeks amid worries about an AI bubble after a big run-up earlier this year. JPMorgan is suggesting some of those worries may be overdone, leaving the shares of many businesses with strong underlying financials and healthy businesses undervalued. PC maker Dell (DELL), which has seen its stock lose one-quarter of its value from its late October highs, was one of JPMorgan's picks. "This is despite risks into margins," JPMorgan wrote, holding that investors under-appreciate Dell's track record of effectively managing rising component prices. Analysts at Morgan Stanley double-downgraded the stock to “underweight" from “overweight” on Sunday, citing concerns about rising prices for components like memory chips. JPMorgan highlighted server maker Arista Networks (ANET); laser systems leader Coherent (COHR)' electronics manufacturing services providers Flex (FLEX) and Jabil (JBL); and connector maker Amphenol (APH) among its other choices. These companies, along with Dell, derive most of their AI exposure from the largest Big Tech firms that are expected to keep investing in building out their infrastructure in the near term, and are likely to have more stable financing than less established players, JPMorgan said. Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which counts leading AI chipmaker Nvidia among its partners, was also on JPMorgan's list, along with Apple (AAPL) partner and smartphone glassmaker Corning (GLW), and optical components manufacturers Fabrinet (FN) and Lumentum (LITE). Data storage provider Pure Storage (PSTG), high-speed networking firm Ciena (CIEN), data center supply chain solutions company Celestica (CLS), test equipment maker Teradyne (TER), and connector and sensor maker TE Connectivity (TEL) rounded out the list.

Title: The internet is loving 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry's crusade against Nvidia and the AI giants

Michael Burry right now $NVDA $SPY $BTC pic.twitter.com/GWmgFMTTb6 The investor of "The Big Short" fame is lighting up social media after he bet against Nvidia and called out the chipmaker and other AI companies on X, which may have contributed to the stock market's slump on Thursday. Cassandra winsBrutal day... pic.twitter.com/DwGiTtbG59 Burry is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble. His massive, contrarian wager was immortalized in the book "The Big Short" and a movie adaptation starring Christian Bale as Burry. Known for his dire warnings of crashes and recessions, Burry goes by "Cassandra" on X — a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed. He burst back onto X in late October after more than two years of silence, and wasted no time firing off several warnings about a dangerous bubble in AI stocks. His hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, revealed days later that at the end of September it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion. Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets "batshit crazy" in a televised interview, spurring Burry to fire back that the AI company's boss couldn't "crack a simple 13F." In later posts, Burry said that he wasn't short and had exited the Palantir puts in October. He also terminated Scion's SEC registration, closing it to outside cash. Most recently, he took aim at Nvidia after its third-quarter earnings beat on Wednesday. He questioned the longevity of its chips, its "give-and-take deals" with other AI companies, and its stock dilution. Some market watchers rushed to ridicule his bearish stance on the AI boom after Nvidia shares popped more than 5% following its earnings beat. Live look at Michael Burry pic.twitter.com/nYJb5dHPSE Other commenters poked fun at Burry's defiance, and his willingness to go up against technology titans and the dominant market narrative.

Nvidia is the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, so its sudden downswing dragged the entire stock market lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 gave up a 1.9% gain to close 1.6% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite went from a 2.6% rise to a 2.2% fall, marking the indexes' largest intraday swing since April. Both closed less than 1% higher on Friday. The reversal led some market watchers to rally behind Burry, celebrating his surprise comeback and suggesting he may have been right to be skeptical. Michael Burry in the past 12 hours https://t.co/LfUscwdnrj pic.twitter.com/kN4FEtxVDu They also gave him kudos for cashing in on the chaos, even though Burry hasn't said whether he holds Nvidia puts or profited from Thursday's selloff. Michael Burry right now pic.twitter.com/87nXleZLX2 Burry also received praise for his Palantir bet, as the AI stock has tanked 25% since November 3, when it reported earnings and Burry disclosed his puts. Update: It's been 17 days since Michael Burry publicly went bearish on Palantir $PLTRIt's down -25% since pic.twitter.com/EtxvlYakpB By no means was Burry solely responsible for the market slump. Investors also soured on Nvidia after analysts flagged increases in inventories and deferred revenues, raising concerns the company's growth may have been frontloaded and could slow in future quarters. Moreover, delayed economic data showed US unemployment rose to an almost four-year high of 4.4% in September. Burry is yet to post about the online furor surrounding his crusade against the AI giants. But his followers may hear more from him very soon, as his X bio reads: "'Unchained' coming maybe sooner than Nov 25th." Jump to

Title: ETH price drops to 4-month low, but Ether futures data hints at $3.2K bounce

ETH price fell to levels not seen since July, but compelling futures data could shed light on a silver lining. Is Ether headed toward $3,200? Key takeaways: ETH derivatives positioning shows large traders increasing long exposure as sentiment stabilizes despite ongoing weakness in broader risk markets. Public companies holding sizable ETH reserves continue to trade at discounts, signaling investors still lack conviction in a near-term recovery. Ether (ETH) faced a sharp 15% drop Wednesday to Friday, falling to $2,625, its lowest level since July. The move wiped out $460 million of leveraged ETH bullish positions in two days and extended the decline to 47% from the Aug. 24 all-time high. Demand from ETH bulls is still mostly absent in derivatives markets, although sentiment is slowly leaning toward a potential relief bounce to $3,200. The annualized funding rate on ETH perpetual futures settled near 6% on Friday, rising from 4% the previous week. Under balanced conditions, the indicator typically fluctuates 6% to 12% to cover the cost of capital. While still far from a bullish setup, ETH futures showed some resilience even as macroeconomic uncertainty increased. A University of Michigan survey shows that 69% of consumers now expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, more than twice the level from a year ago. Joanne Hsu, the director of the consumer survey, reportedly said: “Cost-of-living concerns and income worries dominate consumer views of the economy across the country.” During an earnings call on Tuesday, Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said the company continues “to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects,” mainly due to ongoing weakness in the housing market. Decker said that housing turnover as a share of total available supply has approached a 40-year low, while home prices have begun to adjust, according to Yahoo Finance. Part of Ether traders’ fading confidence stems from nine straight sessions of net outflows in spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Roughly $1.33 billion has exited those products during that stretch, driven in part by institutional investors reducing exposure to risk assets. The US dollar strengthened against major foreign currencies as concerns around the artificial intelligence sector grew. The US Dollar Index (DXY) climbed to its highest level in six months as investors sought the safety of cash holdings. It might seem counterintuitive, given the US economy’s heavy ties to the tech sector, but traders are simply holding reserves until there is clearer visibility on employment data and whether consumer demand will recover after the extended US government shutdown. Top traders at OKX increased their long positions even as Ether fell to $2,700 from $3,200 on Sunday. Confidence is gradually improving following strong quarterly earnings and year-end guidance from Nvidia (NVDA US), and after Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said he sees room for interest rate cuts in the near term as the labor market weakens. Related: BitMine announces 2026 ETH staking plans as market melts down The cryptocurrency bear market has been especially difficult for companies that built large ETH reserves through debt and equity issuance, such as BitMine Immersion (BMNR US) and ShapeLink Gaming (SBET US). Those stocks currently trade at discounts of 16% or more relative to their ETH holdings, highlighting investors’ lack of comfort. From a derivatives standpoint, whales and market makers are increasingly convinced that $2,650 marked the bottom. Still, bullish conviction likely hinges on renewed spot Ether ETF inflows and clearer signals of a less restrictive monetary policy, meaning Ether’s potential return to $3,200 may take a few weeks.

Shares of an off-price apparel retailer climbed after the company touted its success in the back-to-school season and issued a rosy outlook for the critical holiday quarter. Meanwhile, a database software firm remained under pressure as questions linger about its valuation and capacity to meet lofty targets. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back Friday, clawing back losses posted in the prior session. The S&P 500 ended the final trading session of the week 0.9% higher. The Dow added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8%. See here for Investopedia's full wrap-up of Friday's major market moves. Shares of Ross Stores (ROST) surged 8.4% after the off-price apparel, footwear, and accessories retailer surpassed third-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company is the latest discount retailer to demonstrate it's benefiting from consumers' bargain-seeking. Ross highlighted strength in the back-to-school shopping season and raised its outlook, pointing to optimism about the crucial holiday period. Comments from John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helped boost expectations that policymakers might cut interest rates in December. Rate-cut optimism boosted the stocks of companies exposed to the housing market, which stand to benefit from lower mortgage rates. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.1%, while homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) also notched solid gains. Insulet (PODD) shares climbed 5.8% a day after the medical device maker held an investor day event. The manufacturer of continuous glucose monitoring devices provided a three-year sales and profit forecast that exceeded consensus expectations. Several research firms raised their price targets on Insulet stock following the event. Oracle (ORCL) shares tumbled 5.7%, extending their recent downtrend and suffering the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock Friday. The database software and cloud computing giant has been rattled recently by concerns about its elevated valuation and heavy borrowing tied to its data center investments. Following Friday's drop, the stock is down around 28% over the past month. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid 1% as concerns about an AI bubble continued to weigh on high-flying tech stocks. Friday's decline extended the stock's 3% loss yesterday despite the AI chip giant blowing past estimates with its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's largest rivals, Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), shed 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), whose stocks soared over the past year as they struck multi-billion dollar deals to power AI data centers, were also dogged by bubble fears. Their stocks fell a respective 3% and 2.2%.

Title: Here’s why $110B stimulus in Japan is affecting Bitcoin and the crypto market

Higher rates ahead? Could the U.S follow Japan’s path? Macro headwinds from rising debt, sticky inflation, and a strong labor market are fueling risk-off sentiment in the crypto market. Japan’s $110 billion stimulus and record 40-year bond yields are setting a precedent for the Fed. Macro-wise, the U.S economy feels all over the place right now. Take Nvidia’s [NVDA] earnings, for example – $200 billion in annualized returns should have been a major bullish catalyst. And yet, the market still sold off. However, it’s not just the crypto market. U.S equities also saw heavy losses. The S&P500, for instance, wiped out $2 trillion and Nvidia went from +6% to -3%, even after reporting $55 billion in a risk-off environment. In short, this market weakness has been driven by macro FUD. In fact, the bigger pressure seems to be coming out of East Asia, which in turn is shaping a blueprint for what could hit the crypto market next. Countries around the world are sitting on massive debt loads right now. However, Japan tops the chart. Its government debt-to-GDP ratio is around 230%, the highest globally. Put simply, Japan owes more than $2 for every $1 it produces, making it the most “indebted” country in the world. On top of that, Japan’s finance minister recently rolled out a $110 billion stimulus to combat inflation, which hit 3% in October. The plan is aimed at boosting buyer spending. The result? Japan’s 40-year bond yield surged to a record 3.77%. Source: TradingEconomics Notably, the impact of this move has investors turning bearish. Rising debt, paired with spiking government bond yields, is sucking capital out of risk assets. That leaves the Bank of Japan stuck. Cut rates and you risk fueling inflation, hold steady and markets stay under pressure. Right now, 53% of participants are betting on a rate hike at December’s BOJ meeting. And, the market is already pricing in potential moves. At the same time, Japan’s moves are setting a benchmark for the Federal Reserve, putting extra pressure on the crypto market. President Trump’s recent stimulus plan is drawing increasing scrutiny as well. A few days ago, he proposed a $2,000 payout for every household below the “high-income” bracket. At the same time, U.S. deficit spending added $619 billion during the 43-day government shutdown. Put simply, the U.S is heading deeper into a debt spiral. Analysts now expect total debt to hit $40 trillion by 2026, with the debt-to-GDP ratio already back to 124%, putting the Fed under serious pressure. Source: ZeroHedge And, it doesn’t stop there. The U.S. economy is wrestling with a data blackout, an AI-driven “bubble burst” and inflation stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. And when you stack it all up, the crypto market’s Q4 crash looks more macro-driven than ever. In this context, Japan’s latest blowout is sending a strong signal for U.S markets. Rising debt could push for a rate cut, but with inflation still hot and the labor market strong, that’s looking less likely. This will only add pressure on the crypto market heading into 2026.

Nvidia saw a historic $1 trillion swing in just 54 hours. The stock first jumped $450 billion after earnings crushed forecasts. Revenue rose 62% to $57 billion. Profit hit $31.9 billion.
