Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat Research, discussed Monday's market sell-off as an "overreaction". On CNBC, Lee said that the double-digit drawdown in NVIDIA (NVDA) is the biggest opportunity since the covid outbreak and will prove to be a great buying moment. "Markets don't like uncertainty, to me, it's an overreaction, and this overreaction will be a great opportunity for investors," Lee said. Lee's call seems good so far. After Nasdaq sold off 3% and NVIDIA dropped 17%, ,Nasdaq futures are up 1% while NVDA is 5% higher in pre-market trading. Monday's sell-off in NVDA was the biggest single-day market cap loss in history, with NVIDIA losing $465 billion in market cap, according to Bloomberg Data. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $97,500 on Monday and is already back above $103,000; but was as high as $105,000 before the news came out on the AI China's DeepSeek; this will be a level bulls will look to reclaim in the short-term. AI bitcoin miners also saw massive drawdowns, as much as 30%, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which is now slightly higher in pre-market. Lee also alludes to a healthy market structure in U.S. equities and notes that bitcoin has outperformed small caps and financials year to date. Wednesday turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting which is largely expected for the federal funds rate to be paused at the 4:25-4:50 rate. Lee says there is some uncertainty going into the meeting as markets are currently too hawkish and believe the market is putting too much emphasis on a potential rate hike in 2025.

The market reacted negatively to DeepSeek's open-source AI release through shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and U.S. tech stocks, but Wedbush analysts urge investors to see the dip as a chance to buy. DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, announced its R1 AI model development took two months to complete while spending less than $6 million. The model achieved explosive popularity and ascended to become Apple's App Store's number one position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. DeepSeek's R1 model threatens American giants OpenAI and Meta (META, Financial), yet Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismisses its impact on Nvidia and competitor performance. DeepSeek's remarkable achievements face multiple hurdles because of strict U.S. chip export regulations, according to Ives' assessment. DeepSeek's ability to contend against established U.S. tech infrastructure is in serious doubt, according to his analysis. Ives interprets the current decline in United States tech shares because he notices frequent market patterns that make these price levels attractive to investors. The extensive corporate investment by U.S. firms in AI across numerous applications, including robotics and autonomous mobility, makes it difficult for DeepSeek to create meaningful competition. The analyst confirmed Nvidia continues to reign as the dominant AI hardware market leader. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Short-Term BTC Holders Quit, CME Open Interest Slid by Record During Monday's Price Drop

Short-term bitcoin (BTC) holders exited the market at a loss Monday as tumbling prices also saw derivative traders throw in the towel, leading to a significant decline in open futures bets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as addresses with a history of holding coins for less than 155 days, sent over 21,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to exchanges at a loss as the largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 4.7%, the most in two weeks, according to CoinDesk Indexes pricing. The transfer to exchanges, often a precursor to sales, was the second-biggest this month and may reflect that purchasers who'd bought when the price was near record highs around $108,000 toward the start of the year were spooked by the sudden slide back into the five digits. These addresses, owned by active traders, new entrants and weak hands, tend to be sensitive to price gyrations and often succumb when prices slide. BTC fell to under $98,000 as the weekend release of the Chinese startup DeepSeek challenged U.S. leadership in AI and technology. Other corners of the market also hinted at capitulation, often observed at local price bottoms. For instance, the perpetual funding rates for BTC flipped negative, a sign of stronger demand for bearish bets. That’s usually when bitcoin reaches a low such as on Jan. 13, when bitcoin dipped below $90,000 and Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind. The de-risking also happened on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, which saw the biggest notional drop in open interest (OI) alongside a double-digit slide in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Notional bitcoin OI fell a record $2.4 billion (17,000 in BTC terms), driving the basis lower, according to Glassnode data. U.S. listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a massive outflow of $457.6 million. A similar outflow occurred Jan. 13, according to Farside data.

Title: Big Retail is bringing out Big AI. Consumers might not even notice
URL: https://qz.com/nrf-2025-retail-big-show-ai-nvidia-amazon-google-1851740452
Time Published: 2025-01-28T10:00:00Z

AI is no longer just a buzzword in retail. It’s a tool retailers are increasingly deploying to transform their business operations. Major retailers are partnering with tech giants such as Google, Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia as they explore AI’s potential. At least at the moment, the technology’s biggest impact is being felt on the supply side, not the point-of-sale. Carrie Tharp, Google Cloud’s vice president of global solutions and industries, said this month that AI’s evolution, particularly its shift from text-based applications to multi-modal tools that process images and videos, can increasingly boost retailers’ bottom lines. “What this looks like for businesses is brand new experiences,” she said at the National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail’s Big Show in New York. AI-driven marketing will gather deeper insights into consumer behavior to enhance personalization, Tharp said. But the real value, she said, is in improving internal processes. Take Home Depot (HD). The home improvement giant has tested pilot projects to create hyper-personalized experiences for customers. While there are customer-facing benefits, the focus remains largely operational. AI is streamlining operations and optimizing Home Depot’s supply chain — which ultimately leads to better experiences for customers, whether or not they see it. Tharp emphasized the importance of equipping store associates and corporate teams with AI tools to drive efficiency. AI is enhancing speed and reducing human error by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more critical decisions. AI’s growing value to retailers was evident during discussions at this month’s NRF Big Show. Companies are eager to optimize their core operations — meaning that’s where they’re most willing to spend money on AI. Tharp highlighted how Google’s (GOOGL) AI products are being integrated into the retail journey behind-the-scenes. Google’s advancements in search and consumer metrics allow retailers to track up to 10 touch points, or the interactions a customer makes with an item or product before they make a purchase decision. With AI-powered systems, retailers can predict what products will be in demand before they go out of stock “This has important implications for supply chain optimization and demand forecasting, two areas where AI capabilities can be especially useful,” Tharp said. Quantum AI is expected to take retail to even greater heights — although Tharp stressed the importance of mastering basic AI use cases first. “The priority is not only to enhance customer experiences,” she said, “but also make back-end operations more nimble and responsive to changing market conditions.” Fast food chains and discount retailers are also catching on. Greg Fiddes, Google’s director of Chrome enterprise software partnerships, shared at NRF’s Big Show how Chrome OS, a cloud-based operating system, is being used to streamline in-store operations at pizza giant Domino’s — a chain that touted using AI to make pizzas “before people ordered them” last year. Chrome OS now essentially runs interactive kiosks and digital signage across Domino’s more than 6,700 U.S. locations. Fiddes also noted the security AI provides. The software has never experienced a ransomware attack such as the one seen by CrowdStrike last year. This is crucial during peak times such as Super Bowl Sunday , when Domino’s delivers up to two million pizzas. “If you don’t make, take or bake the pizzas, you support those who do,” Michael Crumley, Domino’s manager of store technology, said of TK. “The ability to remotely manage and support devices is a major benefit, especially for a large retail chain with multiple locations.” Other big food chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s are using some form of AI, all with the goal of feeding customers faster. Retail giant Costco also relies on Chrome OS to manage operations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) is using AI and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to streamline operations. This is especially helpful in rural areas where connectivity can be challenging. The move could help Dollar Tree better handle operations as it considers a sale of its Family Dollar brand. Retailers are already using AI autopilot systems — in which AI handles routine tasks and humans intervene only in critical situations — said Andrew Sun, who heads Nvidia’s (NVDA) AI for retail division. “No one ever feels like you have enough time to do the very manual work, moving a box off a truck, making sure it’s unpacked, getting it onto the shelf at the right price, and serving the customer,” Sun said, noting that the shift could simplify a hard job in a high turnover industry. The AI chip maker is moving beyond gaming and entertainment to look at how AI can make more efficient use of labor and reduce human error – two key factors that can make or break a supply chain. The real win for the retail industry might not be in delivering more sophisticated customer experiences, but in building a stronger, more resilient infrastructure. For now, AI’s on the supply side, but as the tech matures, it will seep more substantially into every customer interaction and companies lagging behind in AI adoption may be in for a rude awakening. “While companies are making strides, the majority are still medium to slow followers in AI adoption,” said Jerry Sheldon, vice president at global research firm IHL Services. “This gap could lead to significant competitive advantages for early adopters and heavy investors.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Apple (AAPL+3.88%) is expected to release its fiscal first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. The company’s shares were up by 3.25% at the market close on Monday, while it reclaimed its title as the most valuable public company in the world from chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%), which suffered from the global tech sell-off sparked by China’s DeepSeek. The iPhone maker is expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter — an increase of more than 3% from the previous year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.83%). Apple is also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion. Earlier this month, Jefferies (JEF+1.78%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform,” citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” The company rolled out its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, in October, which “has yet to gain traction with consumers,” Jefferies analysts said. Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities. However, the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the older iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro both have three cameras. This potentially makes them more attractive options, especially if they have a lower price tag, Jefferies said. Shipments of the iPhone were also down by 4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, Jefferies noted, citing data from the International Data Corporation. The firm cut iPhone shipment growth expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) fell 33.78% overnight. The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) and T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) plunged 33.8% and 33.77% respectively. All three funds reported their largest loss in a single day, according to data from FactSet. Conversely, funds betting against Nvidia like the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) rose more than 33%. "This sell-off has been a difficult lesson for investors who have seen Nvidia as invincible and have taken aggressive bets on its growth without understanding the risks of single stock ETFs," said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The funds were designed to deliver twice the performance of Nvidia on a single-day basis. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which boasts the largest assets under management out of the three, saw AUM decline by $2.4 billion from its peak last November to $4.3 billion as of Monday, according to data provided by by Global X ETFS. The AUMs of T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) are currently hovering around $419 million and $497 million, respectively. "While these ETFs can magnify gains, they can also magnify losses and may not be appropriate for investors without a high risk tolerance," Islam told CNBC. Since their approval in 2022, single-stock ETFs have seen an explosion in popularity, with over 60 products available in the U.S. worth $18 billion in assets, data from Global X ETFs showed. Single-stock ETFs strive to deliver amplified returns compared to the underlying asset. "In other words, they're more volatile," said Morningstar. "It could be a matter of time before some of them implode depending on the intensity of market movements of individual stocks," said Marc Jocum, product and investment strategist at Global X ETFs. Nvidia lost almost $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in the U.S. The sell-off was triggered by fears of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek intensifying AI competition and calling into question America's dominance in the sector. Last week, DeepSeek launched R1, an open-source reasoning model that was claimed to have taken only two months and less than $6 million to build. It was reported that DeepSeek's reasoning model outperformed Open AI's latest o1 model in several third-party tests. Single-stock ETFs come with a huge risk, however, they can be useful trading tools when employed correctly, in particular for speculators, market watchers told CNBC. These ETFs are best suited for traders who want to take advantage of volatility to express a strong bullish or bearish view over a single day, said Islam. "While they're powerful tools for tactical day traders, they may not suit buy-and-hold long-term investors," warned Jocum. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 experts
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-invest-10000-right-now-market-experts-stocks-bonds-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Do you have $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket? If you're looking to invest it, you've come to the right place. Investing can be tricky. How much should you allocate to stocks and bonds? What if you need the money in five years? When should you come into the market if stocks are in the middle of a volatile period, like they seem to have entered on Monday? Ultimately, everyone has different goals and needs with their money, and deciding where to put it calls for individualized plans that account for timelines and how much potential losses one can stomach. If you're looking for ideas, we've got you covered. In recent weeks, we asked six experts where investors sitting on a chunk of money should consider putting their cash for the months and years ahead. Answers, which came before Monday's stock market sell-off, varied across asset classes and timelines and are listed below. Stock market valuations are high, leading some of Wall Street's biggest names to worry that the S&P 500 is a bubble ready to pop. While Ragan recognizes valuations are elevated, he still sees opportunities for investors to put cash to work. "We're still pretty comfortable adding funds to the market," Ragan told BI. "We still like the S&P 500 and large-cap US equities." Among large-cap companies, technology stocks have pushed the market higher, which is why Ragan believes it's important to maintain a dedicated allocation to tech. "On one hand, we're saying don't get too overweight there, but I think you still want to have exposure in that sector," Ragan said of tech. However, it's important to have diversified sector exposure, and Ragan sees opportunities in communication services, healthcare, and financials. Companies in these sectors tend to have low price-to-earnings-growth ratios, meaning they're undervalued relative to their earnings growth rate. These sectors will also benefit from increased deregulation under President Donald Trump, Ragan said. Dividend stocks are also trading at attractive valuations, he added. These stocks can benefit a portfolio by providing a steady income stream. With rising yields, Ragan also sees opportunities in fixed income, particularly in short-term bonds. Don't just stick with Treasurys, though. Ragan recommends adding corporate and municipal bonds to the mix. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these areas of the market include the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) and the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWY). On the heels of two stellar years for the stock market, Dobler said he's inclined to be a bit more defensive and cautious in the year ahead — especially if an investor is looking at a short-term time horizon. Price-multiple expansion won't come as easy, and investors are going to be looking for real earnings results, he said. Broadly speaking, that boils down to taking a three-part approach: allocating to fixed-income amid robust yields, so-called real assets as inflation stays elevated, and defensive parts of the stock market amid stretched valuations. Within the fixed-income category, Dobler likes investment-grade credit, Treasury inflation-protected securities, and municipal bonds. US money-market funds and high-yield savings accounts are also attractive options, he said. As for real assets, he said real estate, commodities, and infrastructure plays would get a boost as inflation remains sticky. And for defensive stocks, he said quality companies — those with stable and consistent earnings track records — would benefit if growth stocks start to hit trouble like they did in 2022. "The economy is slowing, financial conditions are tightening, and so it'll reward more of a defensive- and quality-focused strategy," Dobler said. Some examples of exchange-traded funds offering exposure to Dobler's ideas include the GMO US Quality ETF (QLTY), the VanEck Real Assets ETF (RAAX), and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). Quinzel believes that US exceptionalism will drive the stock market in 2025. Stocks have posted strong earnings, the US GDP is slated to grow at 2% to 3% this year, and secular tailwinds such as AI will provide a significant boost to the economy, he said. If you're looking to grow $10,000, "you certainly want to have diversified equities, and you certainly want to be focused on the US," Quinzel told BI. In this environment, investors shouldn't feel constrained by the 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, especially if you have a long time horizon, Quinzel said. It's perfectly OK to take advantage of the robust economy and allocate 80%, or even all, of your portfolio to equities, he said. For those who want to add more stability to their portfolios through fixed income, Quinzel recommends steering clear of high-yield bonds and going for Treasurys, corporate credit, and asset-backed securities. Quinzel also echoed Ragan's suggestion that investors branch out from the Magnificent Seven. He sees plenty of opportunities to play the Trump trade, such as financials and industrials. Both of these sectors will benefit from deregulation, M&A activity, onshoring, and defense spending, which Quinzel anticipates will increase under the new administration. Quinzel is also a fan of momentum and quality investing. "One great way to start investing is by simply utilizing funds that have those traits of momentum and quality because both of those can do really well in this kind of late cycle mode that we're in," he said. Funds that provide exposure to these market areas include the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). For those up for a more hands-on project, buying a multifamily property could be a good option, said Brian Rudderow, a real-estate investor and the CEO of HBR Colorado. While that may sound like it's outside the realm of possibility with just $10,000, Rudderow pointed to a Fannie Mae program launched in late 2023 that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy multifamily properties with just a 5% down payment. That's $10,000 for a $200,000 property. That's still relatively cheap for a multifamily property, let alone for a single-family home, in many areas around the US. But they do exist. "If you can find a lower-income city or a cheaper side of town, then you can do it with $10,000," Rudderow said. The monthly mortgage payment on a property at this price point would be around $2,500, Rudderow said. So, if you charged around $1,500 per unit, you could generate a positive cash flow of $500 a month. The stock market performed strongly in 2024, and Milan believes investors should be optimistic about its continued growth. There are plenty of opportunities for investors to put their cash to work. Industrials, financials, and energy are popular sectors for investors looking to take advantage of the Trump trade, Milan said. He also sees individual opportunities within those broad sectors. Investors should keep an eye on energy in particular. "For the first time in a number of years, there's a significant amount of value and strength in the energy sector," Milan said. If Trump's first term is any indicator of what's to come, Milan is bullish that the president's policies will be extremely beneficial for energy companies. Milan is less focused on big oil companies and more interested in natural gas. "Natural gas pipelines are showing extraordinary strength from a momentum standpoint right now," he said. His top picks include Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) and Energy Transfer (ET). Within financials, Milan is bullish on large private equity firms such as Blackstone (BX), Apollo Global Management (APO), and KKR & Co (KKR). "I think we're at the beginning stages of the next evolution within those types of firms, especially with regards to private credit," Milan said. These firms have poured a significant amount of resources into the private credit business, and Milan believes the asset class will take off in the coming years. Looking into the next 12 months, Roberts said he's increasingly leaning into the AI trade with the $2 billion portfolio he manages as infrastructure investment continues to grow. "It's coming, and it's coming fast," Roberts said. Part of that trade means investing in software and chips companies, like Twilio (TWLO), Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD), he said. Another piece of that play is in the energy companies that will provide the power to run data centers, he said. Some of his holdings include American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy (DUK), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and GE Vernova (GEV). But Roberts isn't blanketly bullish on AI-related stocks. Investors will start to put more of an emphasis on fundamentals, he said, and parts of the growth factor may start to get washed out in the year ahead. This may come amid a move into safer, dividend-providing stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), he said. "I think the unobvious trade is a rotation potentially from high-beta growth," Roberts said. "Dividend value has been really ignored over the last couple of years, and it's very out of favor." Jump to

(Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Even if you don't pay much attention to the stock market, chances are you've heard about Nvidia and its share price today. The company broke the record for the biggest one-day loss in value for a company on the US stock market. Nvidia's share price dropped by 17 per cent. This equated to a huge $US593 billion ($948 billion) loss in value — that's nearly $1 trillion in Australian currency. Here's what you need to know about the company everyone's taking about. Nvidia is a technology company that makes chips, systems and software that power things like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and graphics. It was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. At the time, the aim was to "bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets". In 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256, the world's first dedicated PC graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia, which goes by the a four-letter code NVDA on the stock market, became the world's most valuable company in June last year. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. Nvidia suffered a blow in September, when share prices dropped by 9.5 per cent — at the time, it was the deepest ever single-day decline in market value for a US company. That was until Monday, when Nvidia broke its own record. Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU. (Reuters: Robert Galbraith) As of the close of trade on the US stock market on January 27, it was $US118.42. Compare that to just a few weeks ago on January 6, when it was $US149.43 — its highest ever closing price. When you look at the share price across three months, you'll see it's a pretty significant dip: You can see the price taking a dive at the far right side of the graph. (Supplied: Nvidia) Because of the success of an AI chatbot called DeepSeek that creators claim only used cheaper versions of Nvidia chips. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 and touted its chatbot as being just as good as ChatGPT — but free. DeepSeek's AI assistant — a direct competitor to ChatGPT — has become the number one downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. Last week, a research paper was published about DeepSeek's new model called R1 that said it had advanced "reasoning" skills. The kicker was that this model was supposedly created using an earlier, less advanced versions of Nvidia chips. While this claim has been disputed, it still made people wonder how much of a threat this would pose to Nvidia. That's because the paper claimed DeepSeek only spent $US6 million to make it, which is really, really cheap compared to what other AI companies spend. For context, analysts estimate that big US companies will spend $US250 billion this year on AI infrastructure. So this lead people to question if Nvidia would keep making as much money as it had been. This set the wheels in motion for panic among investors, but it wasn't until DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple's app store on Monday that things really took off. Investors started selling their shares and, by the time the US stock market closed, close to $US600 billion had been wiped off the company's market capitalisation or "market cap" — which is the total value of a public company's stock currently held by all its shareholders. At closing, the price of one Nvidia share was $US24.20, or 17 per cent, lower. DeepSeek's success spooked investors. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Obviously losing nearly $US600 billion isn't ideal for any company. But it's worth noting that the stock price for the company is still pretty high. Have a look at this chart, showing the growth of Nvidia's share prices across the past year: The stock price is about double what it was this time last year. (Supplied: Nvidia) You'll see that, even with Monday's losses, it's still worth more than it was last January. On January 29 last year, it was only worth $US62.47 — a little more than half of what it's worth today. And now look at its growth since 2013: Nvidia's stock prices skyrocketed from 2023 — and it is still significantly higher than it was even when you take Monday's losses into account. (Supplied: Nvidia) Nvidia was worth just $US14.32 at the start of 2023, so it's still up by more than 700 per cent in less than two years. It has added more than $US100 to its share price in that time. ABC North America correspondent Carrington Clarke suggests we could be in for a waiting game to see how this pans out for Nvidia. "Often we see in markets when new information is being divested, the immediate concern is perhaps panic," he says. "The concern [is] that lofty expectations about future profits were not based on firm ground. "We [will] wait to see how this is processed. "Nvidia has a history of seeing major sell-offs and then rising again." Take, for example, the September drop — share prices got down to $US102.83 at its lowest point on September 6. A month later, the price had gone up to $US124.92.

Title: NVIDIA May Be Cooked

By Adam Sharp Posted January 27, 2025 On Friday evening, we covered DeepSeek R1, the Chinese AI breakthrough rattling NVIDIA and broader markets. I wrote the following: The implications are massive. In the long run, this could threaten not just American AI software companies, but also NVIDIA. If cutting-edge models can be trained with 5% of the previous hardware requirements, what does that mean for GPU sales going forward? When I wrote that Friday morning, I considered buying some puts on NVDA. But I didn’t pull the trigger. I thought we had more time. Of course, today I woke up to NVIDIA crashing in pre-market trading. It was down up to 13% before markets opened, and as I write this at around 11:00 am, NVDA shares are now down 15%. In full disclosure, I did buy a few NVDA puts just after markets opened today (even though they were about 3x more expensive than Friday). I have a short position here, so please take what I say about NVIDIA with a pinch of salt. I am now biased. I bought the NVDA puts as a hedge because of how incredibly important NVIDIA has become to the U.S. economy. NVIDIA’s market cap, still around $3 trillion as I write this, is about 10% of 2024 U.S. GDP. So NVDA’s current valuation equates it to roughly 10% of the value of all American goods and services produced over 12 months. That is borderline ludicrous. The company’s remarkable run has essentially carried markets higher over the past few years. Wall Street currently expects NVIDIA earnings to more than double from $1.30/share in 2024 to $2.95/share in 2025. By 2028, analysts expect the company to produce $6.15 in earnings per share. If Wall Street’s 2028 prediction comes true, at current prices NVIDIA would be trading at 20x earnings (a P/E of 20) in 3 years. That’s IF they can grow earnings by 4.7x over the next 36 months. So the pricing is getting ridiculous. The old adage “priced for perfection” fits this stock well. Yes, NVIDIA is a great company with a special founder/CEO. But it appears they may finally hit a peak for this cycle. And when these types of bubbles unravel, they tend to do so quickly. Hot stocks take the stairs up, and the elevator down. If this whole thing about China’s AI breakthrough proves to be overblown, I’ll be thrilled my puts expire worthless. The risk to markets is that significant. If the threat proves to be real, at least I’ll have some downside protection. Earlier this month, our own Jim Rickards warned about how fragile this market is in Positioned For a Historic Crash. Here’s an excerpt: “We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or another unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. Prepare now. Don’t be the last one to know.” The market may have found Jim’s “unexpected event”: China’s AI breakthroughs (see Friday’s article if you need a primer). Currently the S&P 500 is only down about 2% from its all-time highs. So if you do want to get prepared for a potential crash, there’s still time. But with NVIDIA down 15% as I write this, we could easily see a full-blown market panic develop. I sincerely hope it doesn’t happen, but I believe it’s time to prepare for a significant correction. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, cash is increasingly attractive. Disclosure: Author owns NVIDIA put options.

Title: What Silicon Valley Leaders Are Saying About China’s A.I. Miracle DeepSeek

The sudden arrival of breakthrough A.I. models from DeepSeek, a Chinese A.I. startup, has drawn ire, envy and admiration from Silicon Valley’s elite. Demonstrating capabilities that rival A.I. leaders like OpenAI, Meta (META) and Anthropic, DeepSeek’s models were developed with a fraction of the costs of their U.S. counterparts—a feat that has caught much of the tech industry by surprise. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. DeepSeek’s V3 model, released in December and followed by a new reasoning model earlier this month, was created with only 2,000 of Nvidia (NVDA)’s pricey graphics processing units (GPUs), according to the Hangzhou-based startup, which grew out of the hedge fund High-Flyer just last year. The company’s self-claimed ability to create advanced A.I. models on the cheap spooked investors betting on American A.I. giants. Nvidia shares tumbled 17 percent today (Jan. 27). Stocks of AMD, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) also fell. As some tech leaders question whether DeepSeek has more A.I. chips than it’s letting on, others advocate for tougher GPU export controls to prevent China from gaining an edge in the new technology. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s breakthrough a modern-day “Sputnik moment.” Microsoft’s Satya Nadella praised the company’s efficiency, and Meta’s chief A.I. scientist Yann LeCun lauded its decision to open source. One thing’s for sure: DeepSeek’s developments have got Silicon Valley talking. Here’s a look at what prominent tech figures are saying about the startup’s surprising success: Marc Andreessen, general partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, described DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model, released on Jan. 20, as A.I.’s “Sputnik moment” in a post on X yesterday (Jan. 26), referencing how the unexpected success of the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launch spurred the U.S. to step up its space efforts. DeepSeek-R1 “is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” added Andreessen, who praised the company’s decision to open source the model as “a profound gift to the world.” DeepSeek’s performance isn’t necessarily telling of China’s A.I. capabilities surpassing those of the U.S., according to Yann LeCun, but instead highlights the power of open source. “The correct reading is: ‘Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,'” the computer scientist said in a recent post on Meta’s Threads. LeCun additionally called the A.I. stock selloff in reaction to DeepSeek “woefully unjustified,” noting that much of the money tech companies spend on A.I. isn’t necessarily used to train models but to run them. For some tech leaders, DeepSeek’s breakthrough is a sign that the U.S. should continue cracking down on chip export controls. Dario Amodei recently told CNBC that he believes Chinese A.I. companies have more GPUs than expected, as many were able to procure vast amounts of the hardware before such restrictions were implemented. In the case of DeepSeek, “it’s been reported, at least, that they have a cluster of 50,000,” said Amodei. According to the Anthropic CEO, export controls must focus on preventing chip stockpiles from growing into the millions. “I think if the United States can’t lead in this technology, we’re going to be in a very bad place geopolitically,” Amodei told CNBC. To Marc Benioff, DeepSeek’s newfound popularity proves that data, not compute or models, will make the difference for tech companies going forward. “The real treasure of A.I. isn’t the [user interface] or the model—they’ve become commodities,” said Benioff in a post on X yesterday, where he noted that DeepSeek’s success was achieved without vast funds or Nvidia chips. “The true value lies in data and metadata, the oxygen fueling A.I.’s potential.” While speaking with CNBC in Davos earlier this month, Satya Nadella lauded the Chinese startup’s progress. “I think we should take the development out of China very, very seriously,” said Nadella, who described the DeepSeek models as “super impressive.” The CEO followed up on his comments today with an X post seemingly linking DeepSeek to “Jevons paradox,” an economic theory that posits heightened efficiency leads to resource consumption instead of reduction. “As A.I. gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of,” he said.

Title: Nvidia is doing damage control after DeepSeek's AI advance routed the stock

Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%) addressed its tumbling stock on Monday by saying Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek will need more of its chips for new models. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 17% toward the end of the trading day on Monday after being down most of the day amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking.” According to the Hangzhou-based startup, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks — for a fraction of the cost and energy. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta (META+2.53%), and Google (GOOGL+1.79%) spending billions of dollars on its advanced chips. In December, DeepSeek released its V3 model, which it said used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Aside from prompting concerns about high AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success also calls into question U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering China. The Chinese firm trained and developed DeepSeek-V3 with Nvidia’s H800 chips, according to a technical report, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by OpenAI, Meta, and other U.S. competitors. Nvidia is allowed to sell the less-powerful version of its H100 chips to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions.

(Bloomberg) -- As levered-up US investors sustained eye-popping losses in tech stocks and related ETFs on Monday, they could take some comfort from the fact that another batch of speculative traders across the Atlantic had it even worse.

That eclipsed even twice-levered US single-stock funds like GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL), which was on course to drop a record 36% as of Monday afternoon. All types of leveraged products were caught in the global market rout caused by DeepSeek, which over the weekend rose to the top of Apple’s app store charts. Analysts said the model represents a serious competitor to products from American firms like OpenAI that are costlier to run. In Europe, investors have access to more highly-levered products, including some that offer five times the daily return of their underlying holdings. American traders, meanwhile, are limited to double-levered ETFs on single companies, though some triple-levered products exist. The drop in the Leverage Shares 3x product underscores how “concentration can cut both ways,” said Athanasios Psarofagis at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s been a good run, but sometimes you’ll be subject to these idiosyncratic days.” Exchange-traded products such as the ones tied to Nvidia use derivatives to amplify returns or provide inverse performance and have notoriously been caught up in previous market meltdowns. Still, retail investors have flocked to them, drawn in by the desire to chase big returns. Monday’s wipe-out might not dissuade such investors from trading them, Psarofagis added. “Investors are well aware of the risks.” And for investors who get the direction right, they can pay off. The Nvidia fund’s bearish equivalent, which delivers three-times the inverse of the stock’s performance, was up 58%. That product, though, is much smaller, having started the day with less than $6 million in assets. --With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova, Bailey Lipschultz and Sam Potter.

Title: Super Micro Computer Stock: Where Is It Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/super-micro-computer-smci-stock-2025-forecast/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T20:18:49Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer's low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock was a roller-coaster ride in 2024. The circumstances contributing to SMCI's rise and fall have angered some shareholders and polarized analysts, prompting ratings from sell to strong buy. So, what's next for Super Micro in 2025? Let's review the relevant factors to decide. Super Micro Computer makes and sells high-powered server and storage solutions. Like Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro has delivered consensus-beating performance on strong demand for its AI-capable hardware—including servers and liquid cooling systems. Energy-efficient liquid cooling systems are increasingly becoming must-haves for high-powered data centers. One of Super Micro's competitive advantages is its ability to deploy custom server solutions quickly. The company also has important AI computing partnerships with Nvidia and Fujitsu. In August 2024, short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting manipulation at Super Micro. This is the company's second reported accounting issue in recent history. In 2020, the SEC fined Super Micro and its former CFO for prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses. Super Micro's leadership team has denied the 2024 claims of accounting manipulation. However, the company has not filed financial statements with the SEC since reporting its March 31 quarterly results in May 2024. Failure to file on time is grounds for delisting by the Nasdaq. The company requested a filing extension to avoid delisting. Nasdaq has given Super Micro until Feb. 25 to report on the June and September quarters of 2024. The following financial review of Super Micro considers third and fourth-quarter earnings releases and a preliminary first-quarter report released in November 2024. This data may be unreliable if the Hindenburg allegations are partially or wholly true. Here is a look at SMCI by the numbers per the fiscal-year 2024 earnings release: According to the available financial statements, SMCI doubled annual revenue and grew diluted EPS by 60% in fiscal year 2024. CEO Charles Liang attributed the increases to "record demand of new AI infrastructures." Preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 show continued sales growth and a lower gross margin. Estimated results included first-quarter 2025 sales of $5.9 billion to $6 billion and gross margin of 13.3%. Sales and gross margin in the prior-year quarter were $2.12 billion and 16.7%, respectively. Through the calendar year 2023, Super Micro had minimal long-term debt. In 2024, the company sold $1.725 billion in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes carry 0% interest and are due in 2029. They can be redeemed early under certain conditions. The senior notes raised SMCI's debt-to-equity ratio from nearly zero to a reasonable 0.40. Super Micro has said it will use the proceeds to fund working capital and growth. With low debt and strong demand for its AI-capable server systems, Super Micro appears healthy financially. The company's extreme growth starting in 2022 did pressure cash flow and margins. But after the 2024 convertible notes issuance, Super Micro should have more than $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet. SMCI gained almost 8% in 2024, but it was a wild ride. After starting the year at about $28 per share, the stock eclipsed $115 in March. At that point, SMCI was one of the best growth stocks of the year. Then, the stock fell into the $50s after the company announced a sizable gross margin decline. The release of the Hindenburg Research report pushed the stock down further. SMCI stock was trading for $18 in late October, before climbing back to the $30s by year-end. Note that SMCI completed a 10-for-1 stock split in September 2024. The stock values shared are adjusted for that split. The fallout from the reports about alleged accounting irregularities will shape SMCI's near-term prospects. Other factors to watch include the demand for AI servers and innovation from competitors. Short sellers are in the business of convincing the public that certain stocks are worthless. Recognizing that short sellers benefit from stock price declines, many investors respond to short-seller claims with healthy skepticism. In the case of Super Micro, the Hindenburg Research report did prompt a sell-off as investors weighed corroborating evidence of misconduct. As noted, this isn't the first time SMCI has been accused of departing from accepted accounting practices. The prior accounting investigation prompted a temporary delisting by the Nasdaq and hefty fines from the SEC. There was no admission or denial of guilt by Super Micro at that time. The Hindenburg report alleges the company rehired executives who were fired in the wake of the first SEC investigation. The report also says the SMCI restarted unlawful revenue recognition practices months after settling with the SEC. Super Micro has denied the Hindenburg claims, calling them “false or inaccurate.” More concerning was the October 2024 resignation of SMCI's accounting firm Ernst & Young. The company's extended delay in publishing financial statements also sends a problematic message. How SMCI moves through this crisis is uncertain. In December, the CEO Liang expressed confidence that the stock would not be delisted. But Super Micro may have lost the trust of the investing public and that will take time to earn back—no matter how strong the business is. Research firm Gartner predicts data center systems spending will grow from $318 billion in 2024 to $367 billion in 2025. That equates to a 15.5% increase. The growth should benefit SMCI as a preferred provider of AI-capable server systems, storage and cooling systems. SMCI's accounting troubles present an opportunity for competitors. Super Micro is a market share leader in AI servers, a subset of the broader computer hardware segment. Large and small hardware providers would benefit from stealing the AI crown as Super Micro works to repair its reputation. Super Micro Computer competitors include Dell Technologies (DELL), HP (HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pure Storage (PSTG), Seagate Technology (STX), Logitech International (LOGI) and PAR Technology (PAR). For more AI investing ideas, see this best AI stocks for 2025. Analysts' average price target for SMCI is $62.03, which is 85% higher than the stock's current value of about $33. Two analysts have downgraded the stock since October. After those downgrades, the average rating is hold. The income statement outlook for SMCI remains promising. Analysts expect 70% revenue growth and 48% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. The percentages equate to revenue of $25 billion and EPS of $2.97. Analysts expect continued, slower growth in fiscal year 2026—an estimated increase of 20% to 25% for revenue and EPS. Strong business performance can inspire investors to overlook other problems. If Super Micro can meet its February filing deadline and avoid delisting, investors will likely refocus on the company's profit potential. Unfortunately, that potential could be less impressive than previously thought. With correct accounting treatment, SMCI may have slower revenue growth and higher margins. Legal fees and settlements may also have an impact. The company has a Justice Department investigation to manage, plus a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders in October. SMCI stock will probably be volatile throughout 2025. If the company can commit to lawful financial reporting without losing its competitive edge, 2026 will be a better year. Bottom Line Super Micro Computer was an AI success story less than a year ago. Today, the company is under a cloud, with a low stock price to prove it. The low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. After all, the company has ample cash on the balance sheet and steep demand for its products. But the risks, including the possibility of SMCI getting delisted, are considerable. For less risky investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. SMCI generates revenue by selling AI-capable computer hardware in the U.S. and internationally. Super Micro Computer has a reputation for innovation. The company is known for its ability to deploy custom, energy-efficient solutions quickly. A major risk of investing in SMCI is that the company gets delisted from the Nasdaq and must be traded over the counter (OTC). OTC stocks are less liquid and, often, considered less valuable than exchange-trade stocks.

A new Chinese advancement in artificial intelligence, DeepSeek, has left US markets feeling unsettled, triggering corrections in equities and crypto assets. DeepSeek, a startup based in Hangzhou, China, released its open-source large language model (LLM) app for free on Monday morning after reportedly spending only $5.58 million to develop and train it – a small fraction of the cost of ChatGPT, which hasn’t been publicly acknowledged by OpenAI but was estimated to be at least over $100 million. OpenAI is valued at $157 billion and recently pledged to raise $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the United States, but some say such numbers may be called into question given DeepSeek’s apparent cost-efficiency. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told BBC, “This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn’t necessarily been forefront, so it’s taken the market a little bit by surprise… So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that’s going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they’ve already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.” US tech billionaire and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, said that the release of DeepSeek R1 was China’s “Sputnik Moment,” referring to the Soviet Union beating the Americans to space with the first artificial Earth satellite. At time of writing, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) – a member of the “Magnificent 7” – plummeted on Monday and is now down 22% from its January high after losing over $400 billion from its market cap. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also down 1.75% and 3.19% respectively on the day. Bitcoin and digital assets followed a similar path. According to crypto data aggregator Coinglass, there have been over $975 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, mostly traders attempting to long Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins with leverage. BTC is trading at $99,789 at time of writing, and virtually all other digital assets are in the red on the day.

Title: AI-themed ETFs plunge in wake of DeepSeek news

Business Deepseek logo is seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration :Prices of exchange-traded funds with outsize exposure to Nvidia plunged on Monday in reaction to news that a Chinese startup has launched a powerful new artificial intelligence model. Technology market insiders like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have labeled the emergence of year-old DeepSeek's model a "Sputnik moment" for U.S. AI companies, most of whose share prices slid on news that downloads of DeepSeek already have overtaken those of U.S. rival ChatGPT on Apple's online app store. While Nvidia's share price traded about 17.3 per cent lower by midafternoon on Monday, prices of exchange-traded funds that offer leveraged exposure to the chipmaker plunged still further. The four ETFs that offer daily returns of double the gain in Nvidia were hit with the biggest decline, with the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF nosediving 34.5 per cent. Its leveraged inverse counterpart, which offers investors a gain of double any losses in Nvidia's stock, soared nearly 34 per cent. "These movements were to be expected, given what we saw happen with Nvidia," said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares. "We won't begin to get a sense of how much we're seeing in outflows or inflows until after the market is closed, though." Other leveraged ETFs with large Nvidia exposure made equally dramatic moves. The ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF, which targets a return double that of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index and has more than 40 per cent of its assets in Nvidia, tumbled 24.43 per cent by midday on Monday. Those ETF providers could not immediately be reached for comment. "Volatility is what the gamblers in single-stock ETFs are looking for," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "Those that have a bad experience now might shy away in future, but I’m sure they’ll be replaced by others." The leveraged ETFs, which carry relatively high fees of close to 1 per cent compared with about 0.4 per cent for a typical actively managed ETF, are the domain of retail traders and speculators, Armour added. But other ETFs were caught up in the selling, including many owned by institutions and retail investors with a longer investment time horizon. For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund traded down 5.25 per cent by midafternoon on Monday. Nvidia is the fund's second-largest holding, at nearly 15 per cent of the portfolio. The VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF lost about 10 per cent by midafternoon. It has a smaller exposure to Nvidia - only 3 per cent - but owns a wide variety of other AI stocks. "Innovation and competition emerging in something as early-stage and dynamic as AI is not that surprising," said Adam Patti, co-founder and CEO of VistaShares. "The market will have to sort itself out over the months and years, as to what works and what will prevail." The rapid growth of AI enthusiasm sent assets in the VistaShares ETF - launched only seven weeks ago - to more than $3 million by Friday, the firm said. The 2x GraniteShares Nvidia ETF - the largest of the leveraged funds - had $5.3 billion in assets as of Friday, according to data from VettaFi, accounting for about half of GraniteShares' total assets. "This has been a little painful, but interesting," said Evan Feagans, who manages the $74 million TCW Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has an 8.5 per cent weighting in Nvidia. "It has been a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of response to the DeepSeek news, but I think moves like this create opportunities. I'd expect to hear some of the biggest investors in AI reiterate their AI capital spending outlooks after they report earnings numbers." The selloff follows a week in which investors "aggressively" unloaded holdings in leveraged technology ETFs, said research firm EPFR in its weekly analysis. The firm said these ETFs recorded the second-largest weekly outflow on record, of $1.8 billion, with investors selling $400 million in leveraged Nvidia exposure alone. Data for any outflows from these and other AI-themed ETFs on Monday is not available until Tuesday.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? What to Know About the Chinese AI Startup That Spurred a Stock Selloff

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: The Alarming National Security Implications of DeepSeek and China’s A.I. Breakthrough

Wall Street started the week in a cold sweat thanks to DeepSeek, an obscure Chinese A.I. lab that just dropped a bombshell: a lightning-fast, budget-friendly large language model that’s shaking Silicon Valley to its core. The Hangzhou-based firm claims to have developed it over just two months at a cost under $6 million, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock dropped by more than 15 percent early Monday (Jan. 27). If this newcomer, established in mid-2023, can produce a reliable A.I. model that’s cheaper and faster than existing apps, that’s a stunning blow to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta (META). DeepSeek’s new A.I. app is already available online, including at Apple’s app store, and it’s moving fast. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The timing of this couldn’t be worse for American business, given President Donald Trump’s audacious announcement last week of a new $500 billion initiative termed Stargate AI, involving OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBF) and Oracle, which Trump promised would ensure “the future of technology” for America, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. Has that promising vision already evaporated? It’s too soon to say, but it’s now evident that America and China are in a tight race to harness the power of A.I. for the world. Comparisons to the U.S.-Soviet Cold War “space race” are impossible to miss, and many are comparing DeepSeek’s innovation to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, which shocked Americans with the realization that Moscow reached space before we did. Like Sputnik, DeepSeek’s claimed progress has alarming national security implications. While Wall Street is worried about valuations, the Pentagon is fretting over Chinese advances in A.I. that may give the People’s Liberation Army an edge in warfare. Given how top U.S. military leaders assess that our increasingly open conflict with Beijing may devolve into severe fighting during Trump’s second term, this is no idle threat. The Pentagon’s interest in A.I. and its military implications is hardly new. Five years ago, the Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was expanded to support warfighting plans, not just experiment with new technology. Last year, Craig Martell, the Pentagon’s top A.I. official, pronounced that new technology was revolutionizing how DoD does business. As Martell explained: “Imagine a world where combatant commanders can see everything they need to see to make strategic decisions … Imagine a world where those combatant commanders aren’t getting that information via PowerPoint or via emails from across the [organization] — the turnaround time for situational awareness shrinks from a day or two to ten minutes.” While the vaunted “fog of war” can never be fully lifted, A.I. promises to cut through the haze faster and with a precision never seen in the history of warfare. A.I. will reduce the information burden on military staff with speed and accuracy, enabling a tighter “decision loop” for U.S. generals and admirals. If DeepSeek’s innovation is all it’s being sold as, Beijing may have gained a decisive advantage that will enable the PLA to out-think and outmaneuver the U.S. military in any confrontation in the Western Pacific, most likely over Taiwan. The U.S. Intelligence Community is just as concerned about China’s A.I. progress. In recent years, America’s spy agencies have spent prodigious sums on determining how to harness A.I. to boost the speed and accuracy of intelligence assessments. A.I. can tamp down the “information firehose” that hampers the speedy analysis of complex intelligence problems, employing technology to make human assessments faster and more precise. Last summer, Lakshmi Raman, the Central Intelligence Agency’s top A.I. official, illuminated how this works. “Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage A.I. in order to help us to triage,” she explained, adding that A.I. was boosting CIA’s clandestine intelligence collection, not just analysis. The National Security Agency, too, has embraced A.I. with gusto, recognizing its game-changing potential for sifting through vast amounts of collected intelligence data to find the puzzle pieces of national security value. NSA is also protecting America from foreign A.I. programs, and the agency recently established the Artificial Intelligence Security Center. As NSA’s Director General Timothy Haugh stated, “When an enterprise runs A.I. systems, it opens up to new attack surfaces in the AI development lifecycle and A.I. abilities in model inference services. We need to secure and protect these systems from threats and buy down risks today.” That threat from foreign A.I. just got a boost with DeepSeek’s claimed progress. The good news here is that nobody’s certain of how real China’s A.I. progress actually is. Communists lie frequently. The Soviet success with Sputnik, boosted by Moscow’s putting Yuri Gagarin in space in 1961, a month before America did the same, proved illusory. The Soviet space program was hampered by quality and safety problems, and despite early Kremlin propaganda feats, America won the space race with the 1969 Moon landing. The bad news is that the clock’s ticking. John R.

Title: DeepSeek is limiting signups after a 'large-scale' cyberattack

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+3.88%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.12%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.91%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-2.79%), Micron (MU-2.27%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+4.61%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is rattling markets. Here's what to know

A Chinese artificial intelligence startup is rattling Silicon Valley and Wall Street after it demonstrated AI models on par with OpenAI’s — for a fraction of the cost and energy. At just over a year old, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released results for its latest open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week. The models showed a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks. In December, DeepSeek released a different model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%). The release of DeepSeek-R1 has sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Here’s what to know about DeepSeek and its AI models. The Chinese AI startup was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of Chinese quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer Capital Management. DeepSeek was reportedly formed out of High-Flyer’s AI research unit to focus on developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which is when AI reaches human-level intelligence. DeepSeek develops open-source models, which means developers have access to and can work on its software. DeepSeek introduced its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, last week. DeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained by large-scale reinforcement learning and without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek said. The model “demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities,” but has challenges with “poor readability” and mixing language, according to the startup. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, has surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+3.88%) App Store downloads, while the DeepSeek site is experiencing outages from an influx of new users. The startup announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, prompting a temporary limit on registrations. The chatbot was powered by DeepSeek-V3, which DeepSeek said performed comparably with Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 and OpenAI’s 4o at its release in December. Unlike ChatGPT and its other chatbot competitors, DeepSeek explains its “reasoning” before responding to inquiries. However, the Chinese-developed chatbot does not directly answer prompts about politically sensitive topics such as President Xi Jinping or Taiwan. According to DeepSeek, R1 performed comparably with OpenAI’s and Meta’s models on leading benchmarks such as the AIME 2024, which tests mathematics, and the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) which evaluates general knowledge. On the community-driven Chatbot Arena leaderboard, DeepSeek-R1 comes in under Google’s (GOOGL+1.79%) Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model and ChatGPT-4o. DeepSeek-V3, meanwhile, fell just below OpenAI’s o1-preview and full o1 models. Meta, which also develops open-source models, is reportedly concerned that the next version of its flagship Llama will fall behind DeepSeek’s models. Specialized groups of researchers at Meta are looking into DeepSeek’s models for ways to improve the next Llama model, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google spending billions of dollars on its GPUs. In a technical report for its V3 model, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Last week, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025. He added that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Meanwhile, OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY+0.18%), and Oracle (ORCL+3.95%) recently announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan with the Trump administration called Stargate. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Aside from prompting questions about AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success challenges U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country. According to its technical report, DeepSeek used Nvidia’s H800 chips for its V3 model, which are a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100s that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. Before leaving office earlier this month, the Biden administration introduced even more measures focused on keeping AI chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. The U.S. also published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia, to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others.

Title: Bitcoin's DeepSeek-Triggered Selloff Is a Buy the Dip Opportunity, Analysts Say

Crypto assets saw a panicky decline overnight alongside a Nvidia-led tech stock plunge on DeepSeek's more efficient artificial intelligence model. With bitcoin (BTC) at one point sliding from a Sunday high of $105,000 to below $98,000 before bouncing back to its current level just below $100,000, some analysts warned this could be the start of an even deeper pullback. Among those taking the other side of that trade is Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Buy the dip," he said in a Monday morning report. Kendrick one week ago warned of a potential 10%-20% correction thanks to markets having priced in overzealous expectations of Trump's crypto executive order and strategic reserve. The overnight selloff, he argued, likely took care of much of this. While there might be some more pain ahead this week with U.S. big tech companies reporting earnings this week and the Federal Reserve's January meeting results Wednesday, Kendrick took note of the rapid decline in U.S. Treasury yields — the 10-year note yield now nearing 4.5% — as signaling much of the downward move is done. Despite there not being much near-term price boost from the Trump administration's digital asset actions, the benefits should ripple through the sector over the next weeks and months through boosted institutional asset flows. LondonCryptoClub analysts hit a similar note, seeing the crypto selloff as a knee-jerk reaction to a headline event. "The Deepseek FUD [fear, uncertainty, doubt] is a classic shoot first, ask questions later," LondonCryptoClub analysts said. "Flushes like these amidst a still constructive fundamental macro story that typically mark local lows in a bull trend." "Be careful today as a broad derisking can be very mechanical and indiscriminate," they added. "But this is very much a BTFD [buy the **** dip] market still." Bitcoin at press time was trading down more than 4% over the past 24 hours at $99,800. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was lower by 3%, led by 15% decline for Nvidia (NVDA).

Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL+3.88%) and Microsoft (MSFT+2.86%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.12%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.91%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-2.79%), Micron (MU-2.27%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+4.61%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm. It’s called DeepSeek R1, and it’s rattling nerves on Wall Street. The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “AI’s Sputnik moment”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That’s even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips. The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights. Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research. His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development. Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention. Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported. But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation. And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it. The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times. AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America’s most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. So the notion that similar capabilities as America’s most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry’s understanding of how much investment is needed in AI. The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments. Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet. The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology. But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions. DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will win. That’s an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy. Wall Street was alarmed by the development. US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants. The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. The company notably didn’t say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn’t spend billions of dollars.) It’s also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.” Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Title: Why DeepSeek Is Sinking Nvidia Stock?

HANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals. Now DeepSeek’s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force — amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia’s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What’s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock? This cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens — significantly undercutting OpenAI’s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company’s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek’s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. That being said, we believe that DeepSeek’s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek’s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia’s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%. If the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models. Now the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We see a possibility that the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia. Moreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure. Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully reflect these risks. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, roughly 35% below the current market price.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger Stocks were down sharply on Monday on concern about an artificial intelligence stock bubble popping because of the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek that possibly made a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 122 points, or 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite shed 2.7%, and the S&P 500 slid 1.6%. Last week, DeepSeek released an open source AI model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s in several tests. The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Red Badger Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? 2 posted on 01/27/2025 7:11:18 AM PST by Paladin2 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Red Badger dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s.

The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Red Badger Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? 2 posted on 01/27/2025 7:11:18 AM PST by Paladin2 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Red Badger dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s.

The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results.

Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s. So they aren’t doing AI on the cheap, it’s not a low cost break though. https://x.com/Banana3Stocks/status/1883784700566949986 https://x.com/TheTranscript_/status/1883097008900358262 They won’t say much when the market soon recovers most of the loss. It took the entire weekend for investors to digest the news.............. “If it bleeds, it leads.” the old Dead Tree Media Axiom................ This really looks like market manipulation. It will be interesting to see who in DC gets richer from this. Somebody needs to some analysis on Nancy’s puts and orders of several of these tech stock. How true. Hype sells. China stealing more tech? Going to but NVDIA on the dip. They will bounce back. Best stock tip I ever saw was, “Follow Nancy Pelosi” and you will make money...PERIOD.

Posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger Key Points * U.S. technology firms like Nvidia plunged, as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in AI and America’s lead in the sector, triggering a global sell-off. * DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. * These developments have bolstered questions about the large amounts of money big tech companies have been investing in artificial intelligence models and data centers. ====================================================================== Nvidia and other U.S. technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America’s leadership in the sector. Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Title: Has DeepSeek Ended The AI Run Led By NVIDIA? A Deep Dive Into What’s Next For The Magnificent Seven
URL: https://wccftech.com/has-deepseek-ended-the-ai-run-led-by-nvidia/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:45:42Z
Full Content:
Well, it's not a great day for AI investors, and NVIDIA in particular, since the Chinese firm DeepSeek has managed to disrupt industry norms with its newest R1 AI model, which is said to change the concept of model training and the resources involved behind it. If you have been living under the rocks or still haven't understood why the "AI markets" are panicking right now, this post is definitely for you. So, China has managed to launch an AI model that is said to be trained using significantly lower financial resources, which we'll talk about later, and this has stirred the debate on the fact whether the "AI supercycle" witnessed in the past year is overhyped or rather not worth the money poured into it. DeepSeek R1 has managed to compete with some of the top-end LLMs out there, with an "alleged" training cost that might seem shocking. Let's start with what DeepSeek R1 is, and how it differs from the others. The R1 is a one-of-a-kind open-source LLM model that is said to primarily rely on an implementation that hasn't been done by any other alternative out there. While we won't go much into technicals since that would make the post boring, but the important point to note here is that the R1 relies on a "Chain of Thought" process, which means that when a prompt is given to the AI model, it demonstrates the steps and conclusions it has made to reach to the final answer, that way, users can diagnose the part where the LLM had made a mistake in the first place. Another interesting fact about DeepSeek R1 is the use of "Reinforcement Learning" to achieve an outcome. It is a type of machine learning where the model interacts with the environment to make its decision through a "reward-based process." When a desirable outcome is reached, the model makes sure to opt for those where the reward is maximum, and in this way, it is certain that the desirable conclusion will be achieved. Whereas, with GPT's o1, the core focus is on supervised learning methods, which involve training the model on massive datasets of text and code, which ultimately requires more financial resources. Speaking of financial resources, there's a lot of misconception in the markets around DeepSeek's training costs, since the rumored "$5.6 million" figure is just the cost of running the final model, not the total cost. Since China is restricted from accessing cutting-edge AI computing hardware, it won't be wise of DeepSeek to reveal its AI arsenal, which is why the expert perception is that DeepSeek has power equivalent to its competitors, but undisclosed for now. $NVDA - MUSK SUGGESTS DEEPSEEK 'OBVIOUSLY' HAS MORE NVIDIA GPUS THAN CLAIMED Elon Musk and Alexandr Wang suggest DeepSeek has about 50,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, not the 10,000 A100s they claim, due to U.S. export controls. Musk, with experience from xAI, agrees with Wang's… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Compared to OpenAI's GPT-o1, the R1 manages to be around five times cheaper for input and output tokens, which is why the market is taking this development with uncertainty and a surprise, but there's a pretty interesting touch to it, which we'll talk about next, and how people shouldn't panic around DeepSeek's accomplishment. NVIDIA has generated gigantic revenue over the past few quarters by selling AI compute resources, and mainstream companies in the Magnificent 7, including OpenAI, have access to superior technology compared to DeepSeek. Given that DeepSeek has managed to train R1 with confined computing, imagine what the companies can bring to the markets by having potent computing power, which makes this situation much more optimistic towards the future of the AI markets. There's no competition to NVIDIA's CUDA and the surrounding ecosystem, and it's safe to say that in the world where AI is emerging as a growing technology, we are just at the start. DeepSeek's implementation doesn't mark the end of the AI hype. Rather, it shows us the untapped potential of the technology, although the markets aren't taking this development with much optimism, as Team Green has managed to shave $300 billion+ from its market cap after DeepSeek's R1. But, we expect the dust to settle, once people realize the positive outcome of the situation. Moreover, this will prompt companies like Meta, Google and Amazon to speed up their respective AI solutions, and as a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst says, DeepSeek's achievement should rather turn us more bullish towards NVIDIA and the future of AI.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq futures tank, Dow tumbles 350 points as AI fears rock tech stocks

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Title: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card." In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, Big Tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the "Magnificent Seven" is expected to slow in the first quarter before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter. Lerner reasoned that Monday's sell-off brought investors "back to fundamentals." "Washington matters, but there's other factors, in totality, that will likely matter more," Lerner said. "Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With NVIDIA shedding nearly half a trillion dollars in market capitalization today as analysts and investors alike begin to question the demand paradigm for hyperscalers, especially given the purportedly phenomenal efficiency gains demonstrated by DeepSeek's R1 AI model, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves with broadly reassuring takes on the GPU giant's prospects. As we've noted in a previous post, China's DeepSeek recently shocked the global tech industry by training its R1 model at a cost of just around $6 million, which is roughly 1/50th the cost of comparable LLMs from the US and the EU. The model, in some respects, is quite superior to OpenAI's o1 model. What's more, the R1's operating costs are just 3 percent of what OpenAI typically charges for compute-intensive outputs. ALRIGHT, HERE’S MY QUICK, TECH-FLAVORED RUNDOWN OF DEEPSEEK, WHY IT’S SO COST-EFFICIENT: 1) Big Picture on Cost: Traditional AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) blow through $100M+ in compute to train something like GPT-4. DeepSeek reportedly did a similarly capable model for just $6… https://t.co/etCMxlWJdH — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 27, 2025 DeepSeek was able to achieve these phenomenal efficiency gains by implementing a few novel ideas: This brings us to the crux of the matter. At first glance, DeepSeek's R1 model appears to be a dark cloud for NVIDIA, questioning the need for hundreds of thousands of top-notch GPUs when an effective model can be trained with just 2000 H800s, as was the case with R1. However, a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst disagrees. Cantor Fitzgerald: DeepSeek V3 is Actually Very Bullish for Compute and $NVDA: "Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 27, 2025 Cantor Fitzgerald's investment note concedes at the outset that DeepSeek's R1 model has generated "great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs." However, the investment bank thinks this view is "farthest from the truth." We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less. Accordingly, the investment bank declares that it would be "buyers of NVIDIA shares on any potential weakness." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Jevons paradox posits that increased efficiency in utilizing a resource can lead to a greater consumption of that resource. Cantor Fitzgerald has applied the same reasoning towards DeepSeek's R1 model and the democratization of the AI moat. $NVDA The DeepSeek sell-off: Analyst Reactions:🔸 JPMorgan (Sandeep Deshpande): Suggests the AI investment cycle might be overhyped; DeepSeek's efficiency could lead to a more efficient future. 🔸 Jefferies (Edison Lee): Proposes two strategies post-DeepSeek: continue… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Interestingly, analysts at Citi and Bernstein have adopted a similar bullish view on NVIDIA in light of DeepSeek's advances. However, Raymond James analysts believe the development bodes ill for "large GPU clusters." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 early Monday as a global technology stock sell-off rattled markets to start the week. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 3.51% as of Monday morning, bringing its price to $101,295 apiece. That was a recovery from a low of about $97,900 earlier in the day. Bitcoin has been boosted in recent months by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which first sent the popular coin above $100,000 last month in the aftermath of his election victory. Last week, Trump signed an executive order that set the stage for industry-friendly regulations and a national cryptocurrency stockpile — key campaign promises he made to the industry. But Bitcoin isn’t immune from other market turmoil. Contracts for all three major U.S. indices fell tumbled Monday morning as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Futures of the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 800 points, or roughly 4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%), were also down more than 300 points as of Monday morning. S&P 500 futures tumbled 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” Investors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Fed policymakers are expected to hold rates steady following this week’s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The Fed reduced rates by a full percentage point in the span of three months last year, bringing the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a more cautious approach to interest rates this year, as concerns about balancing rising inflation with the strong labor market persist. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a news conference following the committee’s December meeting. “And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings.

Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Title: DeepSeek: A shocking Chinese AI advancement is sending US stocks plunging

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks dropped sharply Monday — and chipmaker Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value — after a surprise advancement from a Chinese artificial intelligence company, DeepSeek, threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3.1% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The Dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by AI, was up 289 points, or about 0.7% higher. Stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. Marc Andreessen, a supporter of President Donald Trump and one of the world’s leading tech investors, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. The stunning achievement from a relatively unknown AI startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the United States for years has worked to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips. US tech stocks got hammered Monday. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, fell nearly 17% and lost $588.8 billion in market value — by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta nearly three years ago. For perspective, Nvidia lost more in market value Monday than all but 13 companies are worth — period. Nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market — over $3.4 trillion — after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years. It ended the day in third place behind Apple and Microsoft. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply. Nvidia competitors Marvell, Broadcom, Micron and TSMC all fell sharply, too. Oracle (ORCL), Vertiv, Constellation, NuScale and other energy and data center companies tumbled. That dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market — tech constitutes about 45% of the S&P 500, according to Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “The bottom line is the US outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that US companies have in AI,” Lerner said. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending).” This week kicks off a series of tech companies reporting earnings, so their response to the DeepSeek stunner could lead to tumultuous market movements in the days and weeks to come. In the meantime, investors are taking a closer look at Chinese AI companies. “Chinese tech companies, including new entrants like DeepSeek, are trading at significant discounts due to geopolitical concerns and weaker global demand,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. “DeepSeek’s rise could spark renewed investor interest in undervalued Chinese AI companies, providing an alternative growth story.” The news also sparked a huge change in investments in non-technology companies on Wall Street. Energy companies had been traded up significantly higher in recent years because of the massive amounts of electricity needed to power AI data centers. But they all plummeted Monday. Constellation Energy (CEG), the company behind the planned revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for powering AI, fell 21% Monday. Competitors like Vistra (VST) fell 28% and GE Vernova (GEV) was down 21%. Futures for natural gas, used to power electricity generators, tumbled 5.9%. Oil fell more than 2%. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also tumbled. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. So the market selloff may be a bit overdone — or perhaps investors were looking for an excuse to sell. “Time will tell if the DeepSeek threat is real — the race is on as to what technology works and how the big Western players will respond and evolve,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “Markets had gotten too complacent on the beginning of the Trump 2.0 era and may have been looking for an excuse to pull back — and they got a great one here.” The industry is also taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor – a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that – for now – still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation ... [+] and market demand. The investment landscape in 2025 offers several promising opportunities in high-growth sectors. While market volatility continues to be a challenge, certain areas stand out for their strong growth potential, technological innovation, and ability to address critical global issues. This analysis, supported by comprehensive market research and economic indicators, highlights five sectors worth investors' attention. Successful investing in specific sectors requires analyzing several factors that indicate sustainable growth potential. These criteria are essential for making informed investment decisions based on solid fundamentals rather than market sentiment. Market trends involve both cyclical patterns and long-term changes in the economy. Key factors include trading volumes, price movements and sector rotation patterns. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates are vital in understanding market movements. For instance, the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in 2024, but inflation rates stabilized around 3.4%, affecting sectors differently. Shifts in global trade dynamics, such as increased trade agreements in Asia and the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, are shaping investment opportunities. Innovation remains a critical driver of growth. Metrics such as R&D spending, patent applications, and the pace of new product development highlight sectors leading in technological advancements. According to recent reports, global R&D spending reached $2.5 trillion in 2024, with industries like artificial intelligence and clean energy receiving a significant share of this investment. Companies that innovate consistently are better positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. Analyzing global demand patterns helps identify growth trajectories. Demographic trends, such as aging populations in developed markets and growing middle classes in emerging markets, shape consumption patterns. For example, India’s GDP growth is projected to exceed 6.3% in 2025, driven by increased domestic consumption and infrastructure spending. These factors create opportunities for sectors like healthcare, advanced manufacturing and clean energy. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations are now central to evaluating sector performance. Sectors aligned with sustainability goals often benefit from supportive regulations and growing consumer demand for responsible business practices. In 2024, global ESG-focused assets under management surpassed $40 trillion, demonstrating the increasing investor focus on sustainability metrics such as carbon footprints, resource efficiency and governance standards. The sectors identified here were selected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Financial indicators such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on invested capital (ROIC) were paired with assessments of market positioning, competitive dynamics and regulatory environments. As we head into 2025, identifying the right sectors to invest in is more important than ever. With shifting economic trends, emerging technologies and evolving consumer habits, certain industries are positioned to outperform others. In this section, we’ll explore five sectors that offer strong potential for growth and resilience in the year ahead, backed by market trends and data-driven insights. Whether you’re looking for stability or high-growth opportunities, these sectors deserve a closer look The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) sector is growing rapidly, with applications spreading across healthcare, finance and logistics industries. Major players are consolidating their market positions through acquisitions of innovative startups. AI adoption is accelerating, supported by technological advancements and increased investment. According to PwC, AI-driven technologies will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure ethical AI usage, further boosting the sector's credibility. Clean energy has transitioned from an alternative option to a mainstream necessity. Advancements in battery technology and storage solutions have addressed previous challenges in adopting renewable energy. Governments worldwide are committing to net-zero emissions targets. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 continues to funnel billions into clean energy projects, and declining costs of renewable installations make this sector highly attractive. The healthcare technology sector encompasses digital health platforms, advanced diagnostics, and personalized medicine. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions while biotechnology continues to innovate. An aging population and rising healthcare costs are driving demand for innovative solutions. According to the WHO, global healthcare spending reached $10.3 trillion in 2024, highlighting the importance of this sector. As cyber threats grow in complexity, the cybersecurity sector is evolving rapidly. Comprehensive security platforms now incorporate AI-driven tools, zero-trust architectures and cloud-native solutions. Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR in Europe and increased focus on data privacy in the U.S., drive demand for robust cybersecurity solutions. Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on cybersecurity will exceed $200 billion by 2025. Technologies like industrial robotics, 3-D printing, and smart factories are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes. Supply chain disruptions in recent years have accelerated the adoption of automated solutions. Rising labor costs and the need for supply chain resilience have made automation a priority. According to McKinsey, automation could add $1.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030. These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation and market demand. While the potential for high returns exists, diversification and risk management are critical to navigating market volatility. Before investing, assess company fundamentals, valuation metrics, and broader economic conditions. Staying informed and monitoring trends within these sectors will be key to long-term success in 2025.

Title: Tesla's future under President Trump: Weigh AI potential against slowing EV demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla’s (TSLA) eye-watering post-election rally may soon resume. The stock, which has rocketed a staggering 65% since Nov. 5, has taken a breather in recent weeks, as worry over slowing demand trends and a rollback of pro-EV policies raised fears of near-term financial performance. Tesla shares fell 4% during President Trump’s first week back in office, contributing to a one-month decline of 12%. Despite the recent dip, many analysts remain confident in the company heading into its critical fourth quarter earnings report. Rather than focusing on Tesla’s first annual sales decline in over a decade, they’re becoming increasingly optimistic about Tesla’s AI potential. Analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush were among the teams raising their 12-month price targets this week, with Piper Sandler naming Tesla its top "buy-and-hold idea" and Wedbush calling the new administration a "total game changer" for the company. Watch: GM's CEO Marry Barra on the company's EV plans “The $7,500 credit rollback is more of a negative for new entrants and Detroit’s big three automakers,” Ives told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. “For Tesla, 90% of what's going to drive the stock is autonomous and AI … that's the ultimate story.” Ives predicts Tesla’s valuation will reach $2 trillion by the end of this year, driven by what he described as a “regulatory friendly” White House that will “fast-track the autonomous future.” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas also sees AI as a key growth driver for Tesla. In a recent note to investors, the Tesla bull wrote that AI and robotics have become top of mind for clients following Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s CES presentation. The AI chip juggernaut announced a partnership with Toyota (TM) for autonomous vehicles and another deal with automotive company Continental and self-driving truck firm Aurora. However, Jonas has not yet priced embodied AI into his value modeling for Tesla. “We are receiving more incoming client requests to discuss humanoids than the entirety of our auto OEM, dealer and supplier coverage combined … While we continue to view Tesla as sort of an embodied AI ‘ETF’ and well positioned due to the underpinnings of our DREAMS framework, we note that we do not currently ascribe any value to Tesla for embodied AI in our $430 price target or $800 bull case,” Jonas wrote in a note to clients. Jonas also sees the Trump administration’s tariff policies as a potential catalyst for the company. He views Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs as a push to accelerate onshoring of AI-enabled technology, a move that could create future growth opportunities for Tesla. “We expect to see the Trump Administration’s EV and AV policies encouraging new domestic supply of critical technologies and supporting manufacturing and supply base,” Jonas wrote. “In our view, Tesla's role in helping to 'fill the void' of next-gen manufacturing and supply chain will be an increasingly consequential driver of growth and shareholder value.” And it’s the AI narrative that sets Tesla apart from the rest of the automakers. Traditional automakers, for comparison, are facing a different reality as President Trump’s threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada weigh on stock performance. Shares of General Motors (GM) have climbed just 6% post-election, while Ford (F) and Stellantis (STLA) have declined 1% and 2%, respectively. According to RBC analysis, General Motors is most exposed to looming tariffs, given that Mexico production accounts for about 35% of US sales, followed by Stellantis and Ford. As the debate over whether Tesla can meet Wall Street’s lofty expectations under President Trump continues, the company is set to face its first major test this week. Tesla is scheduled to release fourth quarter results on Wednesday after the market close. Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on X @SeanaNSmith.

Title: Crypto narratives: How the absence of earnings fuels investor fervor

AI synergy with blockchain fuels new trading opportunities in the crypto landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. Not all narratives are created equal. In the age of digital financial platforms, investing in all kinds of assets has never been easier. This is happening at a time when the stakes are both clear and high. In order to outpace the erosion of money due to central banking, otherwise known as inflation, investing has to yield sustained high single-digit returns at a bare minimum. But in a rush to outpace inflation, in addition to offset capital gains tax, investing has become akin to gambling. This is especially apparent in the blockchain space. To become more resilient when staking an asset, what should investors keep in mind? Lowering the barrier to entry works both ways in the crypto world, but not so much in the stock world. On one hand, people have easier access to capital, but on the other hand, companies face increased scrutiny and regulatory burden by going public. This is evident by the stocks drop off since the mid-1990s, having fallen by 56% by 2020 from over 8,000 stocks. Because publicly traded companies are based on physical operations that exert expenditures and require quarterly financial reports, there is a cycle of inflows and drop offs.This leaves the number of stocks at approximately the same level, reliant on business cycles. In other words, stocks have an inherent barrier to entry, from the side of businesses, which also serves as a signal for value. The same is not the case for digital assets. Notwithstanding cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work algorithm like Bitcoin, the vast majority of crypto coins are based on proof-of-stake consensus. This means there is no longer a requirement for infrastructure in the form of mining hardware and electricity. In turn, there is no crypto equivalent when it comes to expenditures and earnings. Likewise, funded and generalized proof-of-stake platforms like Ethereum, BSC, Solana or Avalanche serve as a launching pad for easy token creation. These factors are driving the number of cryptocurrencies to ever increasing heights, greatly overshadowing the number of stocks at 16,218 (at press time). All of these coins compete for a finite amount of capital and human attention, which means the more tokens are birthed the greater the dilution effect. Not only is it easy to create cryptocurrencies ex nihilo, but it is also easier to access them via self-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges. At first glance, this may seem beneficial, but does it benefit people’s portfolios? Among countless examples in the negative direction is the recent Hawk Tuah (HAWKTUAH) coin, having dropped by 99.14% in value since its inception in July. In the absence of quarterly earnings, and boosted by ease of entry, crypto traders have become reliant on “vibes”, or narratives: The exact same principle exists in the lottery. Because it is known that some people won lottery tickets, the potential for life-changing gains is established, regardless how remote it actually is. This is why the memecoin narrative has been so performant over the last year, as a market cap-weighted category. Of course, that “performance” accounts for the flood of memecoins that increased the market cap and opened up new narrative gambling opportunities. In actuality, most traders lose money based on such narratives. According to Pump.fun at Dune Analytics, 60% of memecoiners lost their narrative bets. A REMINDER THAT: • 60% of all memecoin traders lost money trading memecoins. • 4.7% made no money. • 24% made less than $100. • 11.2% made more than $100. • 3% made more than $1,000. • 0.5% made more than $10,000. • People who have made more than $10K can barely… pic.twitter.com/ADakThjOcX — Kermit 🐸 (@crypto__kermit) November 19, 2024 Although it is easy to see how memecoin trading is a simulacrum of gambling, these digital assets are traded equally with other coins. This includes Bitcoin with its fixed scarcity and vast computing infrastructure to anchor it into the physical world. Consequently, it is fair to say that some crypto narratives have a draining effect on the wider crypto market. After all, those capital inflows could have been better served elsewhere. But where exactly (excluding Bitcoin as the obvious candidate)? Just like the AI boom endowed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) with over $3 trillion market cap, the AI narrative has become dominant in the crypto space, even outpacing memecoins. Notwithstanding the buzzwordiness, what exactly does AI + blockchain bring to the crypto table? It turns out, these technologies are perfectly complementary. Blockchain represents trustless networks, which are prerequisites for autonomous AI agents to operate without centralized oversight. For instance, AI agents could be used to automate tasks such as managing portfolios or yields on DeFi platforms. In other words, they have the potential to turn digital assets into passive income streams. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) makes it possible to create and co-own AI agents, which will then interact with a wide range of blockchain networks. This potential already skyrocketed VIRTUAL token, having gained over 5,000% value in the last three months. Similarly, ai16z (AI16Z), inspired by entrepreneur Marc Andreessen who co-founded venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), is the first AI-governed Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Serving as a utility token, AI16Z pays for activities within this virtual fund to automatically trade tokens on DeFi platforms, post social media content or browse the web to glean insight. Over the last month, AI16Z gained 90% of value. Another notable project is NeuralAI (NEURAL), as a part of a wider ecosystem in which AI agents generate 3D objects from text descriptions. Although down 30% over the month, NEURAL token gained 911% value over the last year. Likewise, Morphware (XMW) gained 291% value in the same period. This project aims to decentralize computing power needed for AI infrastructure, with XMW monetizing GPU hardware across a peer-to-peer network. With 83% of companies stating AI is their top priority, many are already thinking about how blockchain fits in this new world order. If AI already has the capacity to generate coherent text based on input sentiment, it is not far off in analyzing market sentiment as well. In turn, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), could end up systematizing complex derivatives trading such as futures contracts by leveraging technical indicators and social media content. In fact, such AI agents could be more adept at trading volatile memecoins as they churn out social media narratives 24/7. Namely, they could pick just the right time frame to enter and exit the market. Of course, this would end up in an agent-vs-agent trading landscape. However, just like in a traditional arms race, such an environment could amplify the value of AI agent-centric tokens, in addition to their supporting infrastructure. And just as lottery spectacles aren’t going away due to their potential, memecoins are likely to stay as well. But with emerging AI projects focused on trading, at least memecoins could work off their capital drain.

Title: 6 Top Stocks To Buy Now For February 2025

Will big tech continue to dominate in 2025, or will value stocks and underdogs shine bright? If your New Year's resolutions include increasing your net worth, you may need to review and revise your investment portfolio. You can use these expert-recommended top stocks for February 2025 to kickstart your research and get motivated for the wealth opportunities ahead. These top stock recommendations came from interviews with nine investing experts: The experts cited several factors that will shape the financial markets in 2025. Improving U.S. economics and potentially lower interest rates alongside high valuations and the threat of lingering inflation are stoking optimism and caution. And, despite President Trump's vow to boost U.S. oil and gas production, several experts also identified the clean energy transition and sustainability as key themes. Notably, the experts were divided on the influence of technology and AI in the year ahead. Shen, Kravetz, and Bennett believe strong AI demand will continue to lead the financial markets. Chashchin and Stanzione shared different views. Chashcin says market leadership could shift away from AI and big tech this year. "We've been seeing tech dominate for so long, but 2025 might be the year when other sectors, like financials, start to take center stage," he explains. Stanzione sees room for overlooked tech stocks, specifically Intel (INTC), to outperform. In short, uncertainty prevails. Reflecting a dynamic environment ahead, the list of top stocks below includes big tech plays, solid value stocks and a downtrodden underdog. The table below includes six best stocks for 2025 to buy now, according to experts. Let's review each of these stocks now. Apple makes smartphones, wearables, laptops and desktop computers. The company also operates the App Store, earning commissions on sales made by app publishers. Apple's stock price is down double digits in January after reports of soft device sales in China. However, Brown characterizes the downturn as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of permanent weakness. "The real play is Apple Intelligence," Brown explains. Apple Intelligence is Apple's suite of AI tools, available only on newer iPhones, tablets and computers. Those include the iPhone 16 and tablets and MacBooks with M1 or later chips. As Apple Intelligence features get more sophisticated, upgrades to Apple's AI-compatible devices should increase. Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, meaning it outsources chip manufacturing. The company's high-powered GPUs are the preferred AI computing chips. Nvidia sells GPUs and related products to original equipment and device makers, cloud computing providers, software vendors and internet providers. Shen and Bennett are bullish on AI. Bennett explains, "The growing integration of AI across industries is reshaping business models, boosting productivity and driving demand for automation." He expects the AI revolution to deliver sweeping gains in productivity and efficiency in technology, health care and manufacturing. Nvidia has been a primary beneficiary of that revolution. Between early 2023 and early 2025, NVDA stock grew more than 800%—driven primarily by AI demand. While the growth pace may moderate, Shen believes Nvidia's dominance and upside will continue. He cites the company's strategic collaborations and strong market positions in AI, machine learning, data centers and autonomous driving. Tesla makes and sells electric vehicles. The company also produces and sells solar energy generation and storage solutions for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Munoz sees growth potential for Tesla this year, despite the EV-maker's ongoing fight for market share in China. Positive factors for the company and shareholders include: Tesla should also benefit from "federal oversight of autonomous vehicle regulation," Munoz explains. On the other hand, the Trump administration may soon cancel the federal tax credit for EVs. This will be a short-term negative for Tesla. But Munoz believes it will hurt Tesla's competitors more and ultimately "solidify Tesla's leadership in EV sales." Berkshire Hathaway is a diversified conglomerate with subsidiaries in insurance, retail, packaged foods and transportation. The business portfolio includes Geico auto insurance, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom Companies, Pilot Travel Centers and International Dairy Queen. The company's chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is among the world's most successful and respected value investors. Materazzi likes the prospects for Berkshire Hathaway in early 2025 and beyond. He cites the conglomerate's portfolio of successful brands and businesses, which provides ETF-like diversification. "The company really remains undervalued despite concerns about its generational leadership transition," Materazzi explains. "Investors do not seem to give this stock the same attention as other high-profile names," he continues. Berkshire Hathaway's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger passed away in 2023. Buffett will celebrate his 95th birthday in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway is the 10th largest S&P 500 stock, measured by market capitalization. Intel designs, manufactures and sells CPUs, GPUs and related hardware for memory, storage, connectivity and networking. Intel holds a dominant market share in CPUs globally, though it faces competition from AMD in desktop computers and servers. Intel isn't an obvious choice. The chipmaker was barely profitable in 2023, lost 60% of its value in 2024 and was recently removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, Stanzione believes Intel could have a big year in 2025—better than its current price point would suggest. Intel delivered an adjusted loss per share of $0.46 in the third quarter as the company worked to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio. CFO David Zinsner said the cost management initiatives would support improved profitability. This positivity was reflected in the fourth-quarter adjusted EPS guidance of $0.12. Intel will publish its fourth-quarter results on January 30. Reddit runs a website of interest-based communities with volunteer moderators. The company sells online advertising and subscription-based memberships. It also licenses its data for training generative AI applications. Reddit went public in 2024 at $47 per share. Less than a year later, RDDT trades for $184. Kacaba says the numbers "make Reddit a stock worth watching, but it's the strategy behind those gains that tells the bigger story." Reddit's allocation of IPO shares to loyal users has been pivotal to the company's success. "Reddit created alignment between its brand and its community, ensuring that those who helped build the platform could also share in its financial upside," Kacaba explains. Kacaba also highlights the business advantages of Reddit's deep community focus. The platform encourages intense user engagement and discussion. Both elements can be monetized, respectively, through advertising and AI-related licensing. Will big tech continue to dominate in 2025, or will value stocks and underdogs shine bright? Since no one knows the answer, you might consider preparing your portfolio to withstand either outcome. Diversification trims some growth potential but also limits your risk. In uncertain times, accepting that trade-off can be your best option. For more 2025 investing ideas, see best dividend stocks and best ETFs.

Title: Earnings Season Gets Real As The Magnificent 7 Begins Reporting

Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA) are scheduled to report on Wednesday after ... [+] the close, with Apple (AAPL) on Thursday night. The forward earnings guidance and any implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 36 companies reported earnings last week, with a sizable number being financials. Eighty percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This week marks the second busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 104 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. And most crucially, four of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Supportive earnings and stable bond yields sent stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 1.5%. Market Returns The financial sector again contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Travelers (TRV) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 49.4% from 47.5%. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost thirty-one percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal gross domestic product growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimated Sales By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for banks and other financial companies, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.7% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season and this week. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA) are scheduled to report on Wednesday after the close, with Apple (AAPL) on Thursday night. The forward earnings guidance and any implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. This week, there are releases across the sectors, which will provide a better sense of the overall earnings environment. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other companies reporting are Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). Magnificent 7: Q4 Estimated Year-Over-Year Earnings Growth In addition to earnings, there are many economic releases and a Federal Reserve meeting. Notably, fourth-quarter U.S. GDP, a measure of economic growth, will be released on Thursday. The economy is likely to continue to show above-average growth and entered 2025 with good momentum. Consensus estimates for fourth-quarter GDP growth are 2.7%, with the Atlanta Fed projecting almost 3% growth. U.S. Fourth-Quarter U.S. GDP Growth Estimate The Fed meets on Wednesday before the GDP release but is armed with enough data to make the result of the gathering a foregone conclusion. The combination of resilient economic growth and above-target inflation should result in no change to short-term interest rates. While the conclusion is almost certain, Chair Jerome Powell’s comments will be watched closely for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 0.25% reductions in 2025, with the first cut not likely until near midyear. Expected 2025 Fed Rate Cuts Financial companies provided an excellent start to earnings season, but this week will be crucial with more broad representation and the majority of the Magnificent 7 on the calendar. Because the Magnificent 7 companies are responsible for significant earnings growth, their forward guidance should significantly impact overall expectations. The Fed is almost sure to make no changes to short-term interest rates, but Chair Powell’s statement will impact expectations around the pace and timing of future cuts and, thus, markets. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.
