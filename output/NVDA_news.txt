Title: Why were stocks down today? What to know as Dow gives up 700-point gain
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2025/11/20/why-stocks-down-nov-20/87377901007/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T21:58:05Z

U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. "Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026," wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. "This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute," said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. "After all, after the headlines settle, stocks ultimately trade on earnings." And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. "NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat," said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. "Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth," she said. "Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. "Investors looking for an explanation for the current market pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced," said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. "Questions around the Fed’s interest-rate path, labor market, legal ruling on tariffs, and government shutdown are just a few of them. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result." The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. "Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we’re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy," Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering "what’s typically a seasonally strong stretch," Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase "Santa Claus rally." The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Nvidia-Led Rally Reverses Course; Walmart Stock Soars

Shares of the world's most valuable company lost hold of their early gains after a blowout earnings report, while a big-box retailer soared after its latest quarterly results surpassed expectations. Major U.S. equities indexes finished Thursday's session in the red after overdue September jobs data sent mixed signals. The tech sector led the declines, as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back from their early advance in the wake of the AI chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results to close 3.2% lower. Nvidia was one of the day's worst-performing stocks in the Dow, which slid 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.2%. See here for more from Investopedia on Thursday's market action. Shares of other AI chipmakers lost ground along with Nvidia. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8% and Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2%, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index registering a nearly 5% decline. Nvidia memory chip partner Micron Technology (MU) tumbled 10.9%. Jacobs Solutions (J) shares lost the most of any stock in the S&P 500, dropping close to 11% after the engineering and consulting company reported a year-over-year decline in quarterly profits. The company said the results reflected a change in value of its investment in Amentum (AMTM), which was spun off from the company last year and combined its former intelligence arm with its cyber and critical mission solutions business. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its downtrend to hover around $87,000. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers crypto trading on its platform, dropped about 10%, while shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell 7.4%. Walmart (WMT) shares jumped nearly 7% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the retail giant's earnings topped analysts' estimates. Year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and advertising revenue helped drive the strong performance, in what could be a positive signal for U.S. consumer spending heading into the height of the holiday season. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of its Eylea HD eye treatment for patients with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Regulators also greenlighted a monthly dosing option for Eylea HD for patients a variety of eye conditions. Regeneron shares advanced 5%. Shares of Solventum (SOLV), the health care company that was spun off from 3M (MMM) last year, gained close to 3%. The push higher followed Solventum's announcement that it had agreed to acquire Acera Surgical, a bioscience firm focusing on regenerative wound care. Solventum is set to pay $725 million in cash for Acera, with up to $125 million in potential additional payments tied to reaching certain milestones.

Indian markets saw a dip on Thursday, November 20, 2025, as Nvidia's AI chip rally lost steam. Investors also lost hope for a December Federal Reserve rate cut. However, Walmart's strong sales and revenue figures for its fiscal third quarter provided a boost. The retail giant raised its annual forecasts, signaling confidence for the holiday season.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Somehow, Nvidia keeps raising the bar. The chip giant's stellar earnings for the third quarter have sparked a round of price-target raises from analysts who think the stock can climb even higher. Nvidia, the most expensive company in the world by market cap, pulled $57.01 billion in revenue, up 62% year-over-year. It estimated it would pull $65 billion the following quarter, handily beating expectations that it would issue guidance for around $61 billion in quarterly revenue. The results — and comments from CEO Jensen Huang that he believed AI was not in a bubble — was exactly what investors wanted to hear, according to Dan Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush. "Nvidia's earnings were another major validation moment for the AI Revolution and tech stocks. We also believe Nvidia will enter the $6 trillion market cap club over the next 12 to 18 months as the vision and numbers around the AI spending trend prove themselves out," he wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Here's the rundown of analysts who are also feeling more bullish on Nvidia's future: Brian Colello, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said he lifted his fair value estimate for the stock to $240 a share due to higher revenue expectations. Nvidia is paying more for input costs, but that will likely be offset by the company's strong pricing power, he added of the firm's profit outlook. "We still see Nvidia shares as undervalued and view recent AI bubble chatter as a buying opportunity. Longer-term concerns about AI funding and energy buildouts are valid in the medium to long term, but 2026 is shaping up to be another stellar AI year, in our view," Colello wrote. The new estimate implies 30% upside from the stock's current levels. Nvidia's latest results "answered the bell" as the chipmaker reported robust demand for its GB300 ramp, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. In the firm's base case, analysts see the Jensen Huang firm remaining the "dominant supplier" in the data center acceleration space. In the firm's upside scenario, analysts said they believed the stock could rise as high as $300 a share as the company takes over at least 80% of the data center ecosystem. "Industry checks suggest further upside with beats continuing as Blackwell ramps," they wrote of their long-term investment thesis on the stock. "See increased systems sales with the ramp of the GB200, further increasing the competitive moat." The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on Nvidia. Its new price target implies 35% upside from the stock's current levels. Analysts at Truist Financial said they raised their estimates on Nvidia partly because Jensen Huang's comment that AI wasn't in a bubble looked "increasingly believable." Bubble fears are the biggest overhang on Nvidia stock at the moment, the firm added. "On its conference call, NVDA noted that its A100 chips, which began shipping six years ago, are all still in the field and are running at 100% utilization. We believe this is the clearest indication that we are not in a bubble… at least not yet," the firm wrote in a client note. Nvidia also looks like it'll be lifted by its "solid" quarterly results and strong guidance over the near-term, they said. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Its new price target implies 37% upside from current levels. Analysts at Melius Research said they believed there were four things that mattered most in a note about the stock's outlook: "Revenue acceleration to 65%+ with this kind of margin at scale, benefiting from the greatest paradigm shift of my lifetime is worth more than ~25x next year's EPS," analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating. Its new price target implies 73% upside from the stock's current levels. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin, stocks crumble after Nvidia earnings and Fed uncertainty over next rate cut

Bitcoin weakness persists as the BTC price drops to $86,000, alongside a US stock market sell-off and diminishing odds of a 50-basis-point Fed interest rate cut at the next FOMC. Key takeaways: A Q1 2025 fractal and oversold market conditions suggest BTC could consolidate before retesting the $98,000 to $100,000 zone. One analyst made a bold price prediction, suggesting that a rising wedge breakdown could open the door to a deeper correction, potentially reaching $30,000. Bitcoin (BTC) jumped after Nvidia Corp.’s stronger-than-expected revenue outlook helped calm fears of an overheating AI bubble, but the gains quickly reversed as the Dow gave up a 700-point rally to turn negative and US stocks sold off. WHY are markets crashing? Our logical explanation:There is quite literally only ONE headline that can even be partially blamed for such a sudden market crash.At 11:20 AM ET, the US Labor Department said the November and October employment "situation" will be released on… pic.twitter.com/zubNQstd5l Bitcoin fell to a new monthly low of $86,400, and data suggest more downside could be on the way. Bitcoin’s recent pullback is echoing the same bullish reversal structure that unfolded in Q1 2025, said analyst Cas Abbé. Back then, BTC lost momentum near its fresh all-time high, slipped below a key support level and decoupled from a rising stock market before bottoming out in a multi-week accumulation range. Abbé’s chart below shows the pattern resurfaced almost identically in recent months, with the analyst adding that BTC will likely enter “consolidation between $85,000 to $100,000 for 3 to 4 weeks.” More importantly, both corrections were driven by broader macro fears. In Q1 2025, the sell-off was sparked by the US tariff war. This time, the catalyst has been panic over a potential AI bubble, anxieties that weighed heavily on tech stocks and spilled into crypto before Nvidia’s upbeat revenue outlook helped calm markets. The fractal raised Bitcoin’s odds of retesting $100,000 as resistance by year’s end. Analyst BitBull supported the bullish reversal outlook, though his view leans more on the technical structure of Bitcoin’s descending channel and its deeply oversold conditions as of Thursday. BTC traded near the lower boundary of this multi-week downtrend, an area that has repeatedly acted as an accumulation zone during previous corrections. Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory for the first time in months. Related: $90K Bitcoin price is a ‘close your eyes and bid’ opportunity: Analyst Together, BitBull argued, these signals mark potential local bottoms, adding that BTC “could rally toward $98,000 to 100,000” next. Analyst AlejandroBTC took a far more bearish stance, noting that Bitcoin has officially broken down from the large rising wedge pattern he has been warning about for months. In classical technical analysis, a rising wedge breakdown typically marks the end of a major trend, with the measured move indicating a significant decline. In this case, AlejandroBTC argues the structure projects a long-term target near the $30,000 region, a level that aligns with multiple historical support zones on the weekly chart.

Title: Bitcoin's Nvidia-Led Gains Prove Short-Lived, With Price Slumping Back to $88K

Continuing with recent patterns, even the most modest of crypto gains were met with waves of selling on Thursday, sending bitcoin BTC$84,190.42 back to $88,000 after a rally above $93,000 just hours earlier. The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%. Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%. Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years. Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum’s ether ETH$2,746.61, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high). A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.

Title: JPMorgan’s ‘Everything Rally’ Ignites After Nvidia’s Q3 Blowout | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in because markets are moving, and not in small ways. What started as another busy week of earnings and economic data has quickly changed into something more significant. Somewhere between Nvidia’s eye-popping numbers and JPMorgan’s latest call, traders are suddenly talking about an “everything rally,” and even Bitcoin miners are waking up to the buzz. JPMorgan’s trading desk forecasts an “everything rally” after Nvidia exceeded expectations with $57 billion in quarterly revenue and a $65 billion guidance, triggering a 5% after-hours surge and adding over $200 billion to the chipmaker’s market value. Nvidia’s impressive earnings report bolstered belief in the AI investment cycle. Gains spread across chipmakers, and Bitcoin rose above $91,000, with risk appetite returning to markets after a multi-day slide. Nvidia projected an even stronger fourth quarter, guiding revenue to $65 billion versus the $62 billion anticipated by analysts. Nvidia’s upbeat report sparked gains in other chipmakers. AMD, Micron, Broadcom, and Intel all climbed in after-hours trading, reflecting optimism for the semiconductor sector. The results reinforced investor confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track despite recent volatility. After the S&P 500 Index fell 3.4% over four days, JPMorgan’s trading desk issued a bullish note. Andrew Tyler reiterated a dip-buying stance, emphasizing stable fundamentals and stating the investment thesis is not reliant on Federal Reserve policy shifts. The bank highlighted Nvidia earnings and the September nonfarm payrolls report as major catalysts for potential new market highs. SETUP POISED FOR AN "EVERYTHING RALLY"JPMORGAN TRADING DESK:"Given that there have not been any changes to the fundamental story, nor does our investment hypothesis rely on the Fed easing, we are dip-buyers. As we look at the two key events this week, (i) Sept's NFP and (ii)… Goldman Sachs mirrored JPMorgan’s optimism. Partner John Flood described the recent market drop as a “real buying opportunity” ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, anticipating a year-end rally. The investment bank stated that hedge funds have de-risked, while discretionary investors remain underweight and are poised to deploy capital. November has been the S&P 500’s weakest month since 2008, with a 3% decline month-to-date. Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher Mining, IREN, and Hut 8 leapt in pre-market trading after Nvidia’s strong guidance. The surge reflected growing acknowledgment of miners’ expanding role in AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. Nonetheless, institutional investors, including Peter Thiel and SoftBank, have recently trimmed their holdings in Nvidia and major AI companies, signaling wariness over high valuations. Peter Thiel reportedly sold his entire position of 537,742 shares in Nivdia.Why? It’s a bubble, they all know it & are cashing out. – Nvidia ALONE = 15% of US GDP.-OpenAi wants a govt bailout. – US Growth is .01% when you remove AI sector. pic.twitter.com/mk3Nc6yBpk A Bank of America survey revealed that 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the primary threat to markets. Global regulators, including the Bank of England and the IMF, warn of risks from potential AI and crypto bubbles. Amidst strong market enthusiasm, investor Michael Burry raised concerns regarding Nvidia’s stock-based compensation. Burry examined financial data since 2018, highlighting a gap between reported earnings and true value creation for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2018, NVDA earned about $205B net income and $188B free cash flow, assuming all cap ex was growth cap ex.SBC amounted to $20.5B.But it bought back $112.5B worth of stock and there are 47 million MORE shares outstanding.The true cost of that SBC dilution… pic.twitter.com/u8VhZyokrB Burry’s analysis suggests stock-based compensation has masked Nvidia’s real earnings strength. The company posted $205 billion in net income and $188 billion in free cash flow since 2018. Despite this, its share count rose by 47 million, even after $112.5 billion in repurchases. The dynamic raises questions about whether headline numbers fully reflect value for shareholders. This debate captures ongoing tensions in market sentiment.

After NVIDIA (NVDA) beat Q3 earnings and issued a strong Q4 outlook, artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) related stocks have surged in pre-market trading. The beat in expectations helped calm recent market jitters sparked by U.S. jobs data delays, fading rate cut expectations, and a 30% pullback in bitcoin from its record high. AI/HPC bitcoin miners have been the biggest beneficiaries of the stellar earnings beat. IREN (IREN) is up more than 8% at about $50, Cipher Mining (CIFR) is up 11% at over $16, and Hive Digital (HIVE) is up more than 6% at $3.28. Broader tech has also bounced, with Invesco QQQ up over 1.5% at $610 and NVIDIA (NVDA) up more than 5%. The strength in tech is supporting the DXY Index, which is back above 100 for the first time since Nov. 5. In addition, Kindly MD (NAKA) reported Q3 earnings after initially delaying results. The company posted $0.4 million in revenue for its medical business, down from $0.6 million in Q3 2024. NAKA recorded an $86 million net loss in Q3 2025, driven by non-cash charges from the Nakamoto merger and unrealized bitcoin losses. As of Sept. 30, NAKA reported $24 million in cash on hand and holds 5,765 BTC purchased at an average price of $118,204 each. The company has deployed 367 BTC for investments including in Metaplanet (3350), leaving 5,398 BTC in treasury as of Nov. 12; it also carries $203 million in convertible notes. NAKA is trading at 0.916 times mNAV, with shares at $0.54, little changed in pre-market.

Nvidia has posted a record quarterly revenue, which has helped dampen fears of an AI bubble and lift crypto and tech stocks. Tech and crypto stocks rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday after chip maker Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations on the top and bottom line, allaying fears of an AI bubble. Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter ended Oct. 26, up 62% from a year ago and beating Wall Street projections of $54.7 billion. The company reported a profit of $31.9 billion, a 65% increase from last year and surpassing analyst expectations. It also gave a higher-than-expected guidance of $65 billion in revenue for its fourth quarter, suggesting the appetite for artificial intelligence isn’t yet slowing down. Concerns of an AI bubble had seen tech shares slide over the past weeks, which saw crypto also dump as investors sold off risky assets, and the broader market was awaiting Nvidia’s earnings as a health check on the AI-heavy tech sector. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) jumped over 5% in after-hours trading on its Q3 earnings to $196 after closing trading on Wednesday up 2.85% to $186.52. The chip maker’s earnings beat helped lift shares across crypto companies after-hours, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) all seeing slight bumps after finishing the trading session down. Crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) was also lifted by 1% in post-trading after finishing the day down 3.7% despite beating Wall Street’s predictions and reporting its strongest quarter since going public in August. Related: 21shares Solana ETF launches amid crash, but flows signal investor interest Big Tech stocks were also up, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) all seeing gains after the bell. Nvidia’s earnings have also helped to buoy Bitcoin (BTC), which has dropped over 10% in the past week amid a wider market rout. Bitcoin fell to a 24-hour low of $88,540 in late trading on Wednesday, dipping below $89,000 for the first time since late April. It has since seen a recovery to around $91,500, coinciding with Nvidia’s earnings announcement and is down 0.6% over the past day, per CoinGecko. Ether (ETH) has also seen a recovery after sinking to around $2,873 on Wednesday, its first time under $2,900 since mid-July. It has climbed back above $3,000 and is down 1.9% on the day.
