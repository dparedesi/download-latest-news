Title: Is Bitcoin’s price dip a ‘buy signal’ for long-term BTC investors?

Social sentiment crashes while on-chain data stays strong. BTC’s Social Sentiment hit its third most bearish reading in six months, signaling rising fear despite steady fundamentals. Not necessarily. Experts say the 20% dip could be a buying opportunity. Bitcoin’s [BTC] mood turned darker than its data. Social Sentiment just hit its third most bearish reading in six months, at a moment when the fundamentals aren’t actually breaking. Instead, BTC remained near historic relative lows against Apple [AAPL] and NVIDIA [NVDA], and the on-chain base case still looks firm. It feels like sentiment pricing in stress that the network itself isn’t showing yet. Crypto Analyst Nic Puckrin, Co-Founder of The Coin Bureau, told AMBCrypto, “Bitcoin under $100,000 tends to fill crypto investors with an almost biblical level of dread. It’s worth remembering that despite the recent sell-off, BTC is currently only around 20% below its all-time high. This is crypto, not the bond market, so a 20% drop is often just a buying signal.” Source: Santiment Bitcoin’s drop coincided with one of the most bearish comment ratios in six months, yet crowd behavior revealed a twist. Santiment data showed the highest level of Negative Words in eight months, even as “buy” mentions stayed elevated. Similar setups, like in late October, preceded short-term recoveries. Source: Santiment The latest data showed extreme negativity paired with active buy mentions. BTC may be near another local sentiment-driven inflection point. Source: X The crypto market’s $1 trillion drawdown since January was a massive leverage reset. Open interest collapsed over 40% after peaking near record highs, as hundreds of thousands of traders were liquidated daily. But adoption never slowed. User counts jumped to 560 million, stablecoins now handle 30% of transactions, and institutional participation via ETFs and reserves keeps expanding. While prices fell from $3.66 trillion peak to $2.65 trillion, fundamentals strengthened. The market is rebuilding from forced liquidation. That disconnect between fear and fundamentals is also showing up beyond crypto charts, too. Source: X BTC/NVIDIA touched the bottom of its long-term channel, a level that has triggered reversals where Bitcoin went on to outperform NVIDIA’s stock. Similarly, BTC/APPLE stayed inside a clean multi-year structure, cooling off after its July 2025 peak. Source: X Together, this could mean a rotation of capital back into BTC as tech momentum cools. This is a setup that’s repeatedly meant the start of new strength cycles for Bitcoin. About BTC’s current state, Puckrin said, “While I don’t believe this sell-off marks the end of Bitcoin’s bull market, this point is drawing nearer, and that means the swings are getting wilder.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Here's What Wall Street Analysts Are Saying About AMD's Earnings

Time Published: 2025-11-05T18:39:04Z
Full Content:
Advanced Micro Devices investors have become harder to impress. The chipmaker yesterday posted record quarterly results and an upbeat outlook on surging demand for its data center chips—and its stock has hardly budged. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up about 2%, near $255, in recent trading as the broader tech sector looked to rebound from yesterday's sell-off. Here's a roundup of what Wall Street analysts said about AMD after last night's results. This year's big stock gains for chipmakers like AMD have given rise to worries about an AI bubble. The weak reaction to AMD's strong results could underscore growing uncertainty around the sector—or, at least, the rich valuations carried by stocks in it. Analysts at Oppenheimer, who maintained a neutral rating, voiced some concerns about AMD's reputation as a "second horse supplier" to AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), preferring to stay on the sidelines while waiting to see more from AMD's ability to compete with its AI strategy. Most Wall Street analysts, however, remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock amid expectations of growing market share for AMD. Jefferies and HSBC analysts, who have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock and $300 price targets, said they came away from Tuesday's results convinced of AMD's potential for more AI-driven growth. HSBC called AMD's recent deal with OpenAI a "game changing" development. Wedbush, which boosted its target to $290 from $270, said it is looking forward to an Analyst Day event next Tuesday for more color on its roadmap. While Wall Street's targets and ratings may be in flux, the mean price target on AMD's shares is around $275 based on Visible Alpha data and Investopedia calculations. About twice as many analysts have "buy" ratings as have "holds," with no bearish ratings currently tracked by the service. Shares of AMD have more than doubled in 2025 so far, with much of its recent gains coming in the wake of the OpenAI deal announced last month.

Title: Michael Burry is back with two bets against Nvidia and Palantir
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/nvidia-palantir-michael-burry-stock
Time Published: 2025-11-05T14:38:27Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution. Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation. Most companies aren’t seeing a return on AI investments. This tech CEO wants to change that Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months. The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels. Meanwhile, the circular financing of AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%. Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.” Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment. Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns. Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.” Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street. Sometimes, we see bubbles.Sometimes, there is something to do about it.Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play. pic.twitter.com/xNBSvjGgvs Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations. For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday. Yet it wasn’t enough to impress traders after a series of strong earnings results. On Tuesday, its shares tumbled 7.95% — their worst day since August. Palantir was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and is in the top five performing stocks this year. Its shares are still up 152% this year. The company’s earnings results on Monday were “stellar,” according to CFRA Research’s Zino, but the company’s valuation — a measure of how pricey it is — “is a bit extreme.” Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout “Despite the great results, when you coincide that with the comments that Michael Burry made and everybody already talking about concerns about an AI bubble, I think the combination of those factors really helped drive a pullback in the shares, the broader tech index and as a result the broader markets,” Zino said. “We’re not overly concerned about the pullback, but I would say it’s one of those situations where you’ve got to keep an eye on it.” Meanwhile, Nvidia shares fell 3.96% on Tuesday. Shares are still up 48% this year. Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir, told CNBC on Tuesday that people betting against the company — including Burry — are “crazy.” “When I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, therefore in the world, in terms of our impact, … it just is super triggering,” Karp said. “It’s crazy motivating,” Karp said. “Every time they short us, we are just like tripling down on getting the better numbers, in part honestly, to make them poorer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 The futures are trading modestly higher as we reach the midpoint of the trading week, following a risk-off day on Tuesday that saw all major indices decline. The NASDAQ led the sell-off, closing over 2% lower, sparked by a dramatic drop in Palantir, despite the company posting results and guidance that beat expectations. When the closing bell finally rang, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clawed back some of their losses, closing at 6771 and 47,085, respectively, while the NASDAQ closed at 23,348. Big Short author Michael Burry tossed some gas on the Tuesday dumpster fire by announcing that he was long puts on Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Market pundits cited continued concerns about AI valuation as the reason for the selling. Still, after multiple top Wall Street bankers, such as David Solomon and Jamie Dimon, have warned, the market is likely ahead of itself following a three-year rally. The “Buy the Dip” crowd tried to boost the market early in the day, but was met with even more selling by the close. As would be expected, yields across the Treasury curve plunged as investors and traders rushed to the safe-haven security of U.S. government debt. The benchmark 10-year bond closed the day at 4.0% while the 30-year long bond was last seen at 4.67%. One thing is for sure: with job openings shrinking to the lowest level since 2021, expectations for a December rate cut may grab a tailwind this week. Numerous Fed Governors have maintained that the current rate is too restrictive, and the job data, combined with other economic news, may soon prove them correct. Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both finished the day lower, as the ripple effect from the equity market sell-off, along with some chatter that the Russian sanctions may not be as severe as initially thought by traders, contributed to the decline. The big winner again was the Natural Gas complex, where spot prices finished the day up 1.15% at $4.31. We have maintained for some time at 24/7 Wall St. that the energy trade for the rest of 2025 and 2026 may very well be in the Natural Gas complex, as power demands for Data Centers driving AI cloud computing may fall into the laps of the top companies in that sector. Spot gold was another victim of the sell-off. While bullion is regarded as one of the ultimate safe havens, the massive rally over the last couple of years has likely prompted many hedge funds to take profits, especially as we are less than two months from the end of the trading year. The final print for Gold on Tuesday came in at $3930, down 1.76%. It’s worth noting that Gold was trading at $4375 just two weeks ago. Silver followed suit, closing down over 2% at $47.04. The heavy selling of the cryptocurrency leaders remains one of the big stories across Wall Street, as Bitcoin fell 5% to trade below the $100,000 level for the first time since June. The spot price, reported late Tuesday, was $99,584. Ethereum suffered a similar fate, finishing the day down almost 13%, and was seen late Tuesday at $ 3,137. Wall Street analysts cited the broad “risk-off” sentiment among investors driven by macroeconomic concerns, lowered expectations for a December Federal Reserve interest rate cut, and massive selling pressure from large long-term holders. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Title: AMD stock crashes despite strong Q3 results: why is AMD stock down today, and could AMD’s rack-scale AI breakthrough spark a massive 2026 comeback?

AMD stock crashed 3.7% to $250.05 despite posting record Q3 2025 earnings. The chipmaker reported $9.25 billion in revenue, up 36% year-over-year, and $1.20 EPS, beating forecasts. Strong AI chip demand and new deals with OpenAI and Oracle pushed data center revenue to $4.3 billion. Yet, investors booked profits after massive gains this year. AMD’s $406 billion market cap and high 150.63 P/E ratio reflect steep valuation worries. Analysts still see rack-scale AI systems as AMD’s 2026 growth catalyst.

Title: Burry’s New ‘Big Short’ on AI
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/burrys-new-big-short-on-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:00:30Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 4, 2025 The Big Short is one of my favorite movies (and books). It’s a powerful story of investors who bet against the housing bubble, persevered through adversity, and won big. The story focuses on Michael J. Burry, a small but successful hedge fund manager in California. In the movie, Burry is played by actor Christian Bale. There are others featured in The Big Short who bet against the housing market, but today we’re going to focus on Burry and his new AI short. First, however, some background is in order. Back around 2004-2005, Burry discovered that lenders were giving huge loans to borrowers with bad credit, and as a topper, many of these mortgages were teasers with adjustable rates. The first few years were artificially cheap, then payments would balloon. Burry dissected the data, and discovered a great way to bet against housing using credit default swaps (CDS) on mortgage bonds. Many of Burry’s hedge fund clients thought he was insane. Betting so much of the fund’s capital against housing seemed ludicrous. Burry was forced to restrict fund redemptions, so his investors had no choice but to ride along with him. When the bubble finally burst, Burry’s fund made a killing. After fees, his big short returned almost 500% to investors. Burry had beat the big banks at their own game. But be warned. This story has inspired countless traders to attempt their own big shorts, with mixed results. At best… Michael J. Burry is a reclusive fellow. He keeps a low profile, but occasionally resurfaces on X (Twitter). On X, Burry goes by the handle “Cassandra”. Cassandra was an ancient Trojan priestess dedicated to the god Apollo. She was cursed with the ability to predict the future, but never be believed. The last time Burry reappeared was in January of 2023, when he posted a simple message: Sell. Via ZeroHedge Since then, the market has soared 69% higher. Burry got burnt on that big short. Shortly after, Burry deleted all his X posts and deactivated his account. But now Cassandra has finally returned to X. Just as 13F SEC filings disclosed his hedge fund, Scion Capital, took big short positions on Palantir (PLTR) and NVIDIA (NVDA). As of September 30th (these filings have a delay), Burry’s hedge fund held puts worth $912 million in Palantir and $186 million in NVIDIA (notional). Burry has seemingly initiated a new ‘Big Short’ on AI. It isn’t surprising to me that Burry is betting big against Palantir. It might be the most overvalued large-cap stock I’ve ever seen. The chart shows just how unusual Palantir’s valuation is. To be clear, Palantir is growing fast and appears to have tech which nobody else does. But it still looks way overpriced. Its current price-to-sales ratio is an incredible 126x. The company is valued at $491 billion and only produced $3.9 billion of revenue over the past year. Even during the dotcom bubble, no large company ever reached such lofty heights. Burry followed up his big AI short disclosure with some charts showing how AI bubble spending is similar to the dotcom era: We should remember that these filings have a delay, so these were Scion’s positions as of September 30th. Since then both NVDA and PLTR have risen, which means that thus far, Burry’s bet is down. He could have sold out of these positions, or added to them. We don’t know. Attempting to nail the top on red-hot stocks like these is extremely difficult. Even when he made the housing bubble bet, Burry had to wait years for it to pay off. In the meantime, he had to pay significant premiums on the CDS (his short instrument). For a while, it looked like his housing bet might fail. But eventually the housing bubble did pop, and Burry came out way ahead. We’ll have to wait and see whether he’ll be proven correct with this latest AI short. It’s easy to see that certain AI stocks are overvalued. Timing the short, however, is the tricky part. Today Palantir is down almost 7% today after reporting earnings yesterday. Palantir CEO and co-founder Alex Karp isn’t happy about Burry’s short position, calling it “market manipulation”. He told CNBC the following this morning: “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird. The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats**t crazy. … I do think this behavior is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” Is this the beginning of the crash? Or just a correction after a parabolic move, and there’s more upside ahead? I’m not taking a bet either way, for now. My advice: don’t bet the house on an AI collapse. As Keynes famously said, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this story.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage. With recent deals signed with NVDA, META, and an OpenAI expansion, we estimate ~85% QoQ backlog growth,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “As Blackwell + customer ramps come online in 4Q, we expect a revenue reacceleration into year-end and outsized (~$100M+) revenue beats.” The image featured for this article is © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Latest Podcast Episode OpenAI Signs Two Massive Deals and Two New Portfolio Buys 51 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Live Nov 4, 2025 Live Oct 30, 2025 The broad markets are mixed to kick off trading today.
