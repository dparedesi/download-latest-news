Title: Nvidia stock jumps after the AI titan says it can sell some of its top chips to China again

The move: Nvidia stock jumped as much as 5% on Tuesday morning, rising to $172.39 a share. After bottoming in April, the stock has regained momentum and is currently up more than 27% year-to-date. The chart: Why: The company said that the US government will clear it to start shipping its H20 chips to China again. In a July 14 blog post, Nvidia announced that it had begun filing applications to resume selling the H20 GPU in China. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," it added. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently met with policymakers in both the US and China, including President Donald Trump, to discuss the importance of supporting artificial intelligence infrastructure. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said in an interview on Tuesday morning that multiple Chinese firms are currently at work on similar chips, which could pose a threat to America's AI dominance. This decision is a stark contrast from the Trump administration's previous position on Chinese trade relations. In April 2025, NVDA stock fell as the White House announced strict controls on selling AI-enabling chips to China. What it means: Morgan Stanley CIO and chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson said he sees the development as a highly bullish indicator for the broader AI sector. He said that the AI capital expenditure (capex) cycle has been significant for the market's recovery, although it often doesn't receive much attention. "This deal is just more fuel to that fire," he said. Wilson also noted that the new Chinese revenue would be a "huge, positive kick to margins" for Nvidia. Reports indicate that Chinese firms are already rushing to buy the Nvidia chip when H20 sales resume. Jump to

CoreWeave (CRWV) shares extended gains this week after the Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it would invest more than $6 billion in a new AI data center in Pennsylvania. The AI cloud provider’s stock jumped over 8% to above $143 in early trading Tuesday, building on a 5% gain a day earlier. Shares have more than tripled since CoreWeave went public in March but are down about 14% from last week, when the company announced a $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific. CoreWeave plans to announce the data center investment as part of a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump and other lawmakers and industry leaders at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit. “The demand for high-performance AI compute is relentless, and CoreWeave is scaling a cloud purpose-built for AI to meet it and strengthen US leadership,” CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said. “This data center will accelerate innovation and drive economic growth across the region.”

Title: Bernstein Analyst Declares NVIDIA H20 Ban Was “Unnecessary And, Frankly, Somewhat Nonsensical,” Another Analyst Sees Broader Strokes Of A Rare Earths Deal

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. It appears that the US has eased some of its heretofore stringent restrictions on China's access to advanced silicon chips, unlocking a huge windfall for NVIDIA and AMD in the process, with a Citi analyst now theorizing that the reprieve could have been part of a broader rare earth magnets deal with China. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, NVIDIA published a blog post earlier today, announcing the imminent filing of an application with the US government to resume the sale of its China-specific H20 GPUs. As we noted in our post on this topic, NVIDIA now claims that it has received assurances from US officials that it will receive the requisite authorization promptly. As such, the company hopes to commence deliveries of the H20 GPUs to China "soon." Meanwhile, AMD has also announced its intention to seek the requisite US approvals to resume the shipments of its China-specific MI308 GPUs This brings us to the crux of the matter. While commenting on this major breakthrough, a Bernstein analyst has noted that NVIDIA lost around $4.5 billion in its April-ending quarter from inventory write-offs and the associated purchase commitments after the Trump administration communicated to the chipmaker on the 09th of April that its H20 GPUs were to be subjected to an "indefinite" export licensing requirement. What's more, these licensing requirements also cost NVIDIA around $8 billion in potential revenue during the ongoing quarter. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has previously stated that its annual revenue opportunity in China stood at $50 billion. While Bernstein is uncertain whether all customers behind NVIDIA's pre-ban quarterly revenue run-rate in China would receive the requisite US authorizations, the firm calculates that "every ~$10B of recovered NVDA China revenues would drive roughly 25 cents in additional EPS." The Bernstein analyst concludes: "We always saw the H20 ban as unnecessary and, frankly, somewhat nonsensical." Meanwhile, Citi has theorized that the broader strokes of a rare earth magnets deal with China might have prompted this major breakthrough: "While US/China has patched up recently post EDA ban removal and a rare earth magnets deal, we believe this reversal could be part of the deal too."

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: American chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) says it plans to resume sales to China of an artificial intelligence chip that’s become part of a global race pitting the world’s biggest economies against each other. The company’s announcement on Monday comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week. Huang has argued that restricting sales of American technology to China could put the US position as a global AI leader at risk — and the company had also said the restrictions were causing it to miss out on billions of dollars in lost revenue. AMD, another major chipmaker, said on Tuesday that it too was planning to restart sales of its AI chips to China. “We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review,” the company said in a statement to CNN. “We plan to resume shipments as licenses are approved. We applaud the progress made by the Trump Administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg in an interview Tuesday that the Nvidia export controls have been a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks, in which the two countries have made a deal to lower tariffs charged on one another. The same day Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the resumption of Nvidia’s AI chip sales to China was part of the trade agreement with Beijing on rare earths. “We put that in the trade deal with the magnets,” he told Reuters, referring to rare earth magnets. China’s controls on rare earth exports became a major focus in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington in London last month. In exchange for increasing shipments of the critical resources, the US also agreed to lift export curbs on microchip designing software, ethane and jet engines. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, and last week became the first publicly traded firm to reach a valuation of $4 trillion, thanks to its role in the artificial intelligence market. The company’s chips are used to power technologies ranging from AI chatbots to robotics and self-driving cars. Nvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company’s sales in 2024 — in the face of strict US export controls. But in April, the White House told the company it would need a special license to export the H20 to China, forcing the company to halt sales. The H20 is widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model. On Monday, Nvidia said that it had applied to sell the H20 in China again and received assurances from the US government that those licenses will be approved, allowing the company to “start deliveries soon.” Related article Nvidia’s CEO says the US should ‘reduce’ dependency on other countries, onshore technology manufacturing The US government has sought to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. But Huang has argued that if American technology companies are restricted from selling to China, Chinese developers will simply create their own, which could undermine US leadership. “In order for America to be the world leader, just like we want the world to be built on the American dollar, using the American dollar as a global standard, we want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” Huang told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. “We love that the internet is created by American technology and is built on American technology, and so we should continue to aspire to that.” The chipmaker said in May that it missed out on $2.5 billion in additional revenue that would have come from H20 sales to China during the first quarter of 2025 and expected another $8 billion revenue loss during the second quarter. Last month, Nvidia said it would no longer include China in its sales and profit forecasts because of uncertainty surrounding export controls. Huang is scheduled to hold a media briefing in Beijing on Wednesday when he attends a supply chain expo, his second visit to China after a trip in April where he stressed the importance of the Chinese market.

Title: NVIDIA Successfully Negotiates The Resumption Of H20 GPU Sales In China, Unveils A New GPU For The Chinese Market

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In a dramatic turn of events, NVIDIA's Jensen Huang seems to have achieved unparalleled success during his recent meeting with President Trump at the White House, winning for his company a dual reprieve in relation to the prevailing restrictions on the sale of American silicon chips in China. Nvidia $NVDA CEO Jensen Huang just said:Nvidia will resume H20 sales to China 🇨🇳 with a new compliant GPU which the US 🇺🇸 has reportedly assured Nvidia it will grant licenses forHere is the full statement from Nvidia:"This month, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang… pic.twitter.com/MKZwdHnplg To wit, NVIDIA has just announced that it is filing an application with the US government to resume the sale of H20 GPUs in China. NVIDIA claims that it has been assured by US officials that it will receive the requisite authorization promptly. As such, the company hopes to "soon" commence deliveries of the H20 GPUs to China. Moreover, NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has also announced a new, dedicated AI GPU for China - an RTX PRO variant - that reportedly meets the requirements of the Trump administration and "is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics." As a refresher, the Trump administration had formally communicated to NVIDIA on the 09th of April that it's China-specific H20 GPU was to be subjected to an "indefinite" export licensing requirement. This development had then prompted NVIDIA to announce charges of up to $5.5 billion for its fiscal Q1 2026 (which concluded on the 27th of April), incurred from writing off "inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves" for the H20 GPU. Additionally, NVIDIA completely wrote off its China-origin TAM following the imposition of US licensing requirements on its country-specific H20 GPU, vowing to treat any residual sales in China as an undiscounted windfall instead of a solid figure factored into its guidance. Of course, NVIDIA has been firing on all cylinders even without the Chinese tailwind. For instance, as per a recent assessment by UBS (detailed here), NVIDIA currently has visibility into a whopping $1.5 trillion in data center revenue! This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Coming back, while speaking to reporters in Washington DC, Huang just delivered the following remarks: "General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation." He went on to note: "We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America."

US Stock futures slide as President Donald Trump announces 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, set to begin August 1, raising fresh concerns over trade tensions. While markets dipped early, they rebounded slightly as investors hoped the tariffs would be negotiated down. Traders are also focused on this week’s second-quarter earnings reports from big banks like JPMorgan and upcoming inflation data, both of which could impact sentiment. Meanwhile, Trump’s growing rift with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adds pressure to markets already on edge. Also, Bitcoin hits another record, and Tesla eyes a potential xAI investment vote.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. I can’t understandably describe the more recent history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia 16 posted on 07/13/2025 7:19:33 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Hopper architecture was the first Nvidia architecture to implement the transformer engine. The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) 17 posted on 07/13/2025 7:24:58 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, it is also a good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties. Initialize the scoring matrix. The dimensions of the scoring matrix are 1+length of each sequence respectively. All the elements of the first row and the first column are set to 0. The extra first row and first column make it possible to align one sequence to another at any position, and setting them to 0 makes the terminal gap free from penalty. Scoring. Score each element from left to right, top to bottom in the matrix, considering the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). If none of the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used and the source of that score is recorded. Traceback. Starting at the element with the highest score, traceback based on the source of each score recursively, until 0 is encountered. The segments that have the highest similarity score based on the given scoring system is generated in this process. To obtain the second best local alignment, apply the traceback process starting at the second highest score outside the trace of the best alignment. The Smith–Waterman algorithm finds the segments in two sequences that have similarities while the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm aligns two complete sequences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm 18 posted on 07/13/2025 7:31:19 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970. The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm 19 posted on 07/13/2025 7:34:08 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep Maybe he buy a sport jacket. 20 posted on 07/14/2025 2:25:03 AM PDT by minnesota_bound (Making money now.

Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance.

The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) 17 posted on 07/13/2025 7:24:58 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, it is also a good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties. Initialize the scoring matrix. The dimensions of the scoring matrix are 1+length of each sequence respectively. All the elements of the first row and the first column are set to 0. The extra first row and first column make it possible to align one sequence to another at any position, and setting them to 0 makes the terminal gap free from penalty. Scoring. Score each element from left to right, top to bottom in the matrix, considering the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). If none of the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used and the source of that score is recorded. Traceback. Starting at the element with the highest score, traceback based on the source of each score recursively, until 0 is encountered. The segments that have the highest similarity score based on the given scoring system is generated in this process. To obtain the second best local alignment, apply the traceback process starting at the second highest score outside the trace of the best alignment. The Smith–Waterman algorithm finds the segments in two sequences that have similarities while the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm aligns two complete sequences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm 18 posted on 07/13/2025 7:31:19 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences.

The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm 19 posted on 07/13/2025 7:34:08 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep Maybe he buy a sport jacket. 20 posted on 07/14/2025 2:25:03 AM PDT by minnesota_bound (Making money now.

The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm Maybe he buy a sport jacket.

Title: With Markets At All-Time Highs, A First-Time Investor Hesitates. The Fear Of Buying At The Top Is Hard To Shake

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. A Reddit user recently opened up about a common fear many new investors face: buying into the stock market when prices are peaking. “I feel weird about starting investing when companies are in an all-time high,” wrote the poster, who said they’re ready to invest a lump sum this month but are second-guessing the timing. Today's Best Finance Deals The person, who isn’t currently invested outside of a 401(k), said they believe in the long-term potential of AI and tech companies. They’re not expecting massive short-term gains, but they do hope that “the current top companies with a combined market cap of 10T might be worth 2-3x more 20 years from now.” Don't Miss: Their hesitation comes at a time when the markets continue to break records. On July 10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed roughly 0.4% in a continuation of recent gains across major indexes. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% to finish at a new record high of 6,280.46, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.1% to mark its second consecutive all-time high. AI chipmaker Nvidia NVDA closed slightly higher, ending the day just above a $4 trillion market cap, making it the first public company in history to surpass that milestone. The post triggered many responses from Reddit’s r/stocks community, most urging the user to stop overthinking and just start investing. “If you bought at the all time highs for each year, you wouldn’t be far from those who perfectly timed the bottoms,” one investor said, referencing data that shows time in the market typically beats trying to time the market. Another pointed out that the market is almost always at a high. “Zoom out, the market is usually near or at ATH,” they wrote. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. Plenty of commenters acknowledged the fear of losing money right after a big buy. While many recognized that lump sum investing performs better most of the time, others recommended a slower approach known as dollar-cost averaging. “DCA isn't to get the most gains, it's to remove the possibility of buying a large sum and having it crash right after,” one person wrote. “It's like buying insurance.” Others were more straightforward. “There's always a reason not to buy,” one person said. “When you lose out on thousands years from now, not getting in, you'll regret it.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now One Redditor shared their own anxiety-ridden journey as a new investor who inherited money from a parent: “Sometimes I feel like the more informed I am, the worse my returns have become.” There was also plenty of humor in the thread. “Just know that as soon as you buy, the market will crash. That’s the law of this subreddit,” joked one top comment. Despite the jokes and differing strategies, most commenters echoed the same long-term philosophy: invest early, stay consistent, and don't let fear paralyze you. As one put it, “You can buy at all time highs today or at all time highs five years from now. Your choice.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Preview
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/07/13/second-quarter-earnings-season-preview/
Time Published: 2025-07-13T12:23:53Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The second-quarter earnings season begins this week, with 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. ... More This week has a heavy emphasis on banks including: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (AP Photo/File) The second-quarter earnings season begins this week. 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, with a heavy emphasis on the large banks. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Blackrock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs (GS), PepsiCo (PEP), Netflix (NFLX), 3M (MMM), and American Express (AXP). With only a few companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 4.8% year-over-year, slightly below the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings growth rate is 9.0% and 2026’s expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Tariff worries led to a slight decline in the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results next week. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth According to FactSet data, the earnings expectations for the financial sector are deceptively low due to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). JPM reported a significant gain from sales of Visa (V) stock in the same quarter last year, so the company has challenging year-over-year comparisons. If JPM is excluded from the financial sector, year-over-year earnings growth improves to 9.3% from 2.4%. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector On the other side of the ledger, earnings growth rate expectations within the communication services sector are being flattered by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). According to FactSet, WBD reported a significant loss last year due to a goodwill impairment charge, so it is benefiting from extremely easy comparisons. If WBD is excluded, the expected growth of the communication services sector falls from 29.4% year-over-year to 8.2%. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Energy Commodities Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be some upside to sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.2% is meeting expectations. GDP Growth Fuels S&P 500 Sales Consistent with the earnings picture, revenues in the energy sector should see the most significant year-over-year decline. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. US Dollar The economic calendar also heats up this week with consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales. Tuesday’s June CPI is expected to be hotter, increasing to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.4%. The Federal Reserve already expects some inflation impact from tariffs and is likely on the sidelines until at least September. The retail sales report on Thursday is expected to show a modest rebound for the US consumer. Since consumers are a crucial driver of the US economy, this rebound will be essential for economic growth expectations. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to be implemented on August 1, barring an acceptable trade agreement. With financials dominating the first week of earnings season, the headline earnings should begin on a positive note. With the tariff overhang and consensus expecting an acceleration in earnings growth for the third quarter, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched closely.

Title: Wall Street’s Deepest Values: 5 Cheap CEFs Yielding 7%+
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/07/13/wall-streets-deepest-values-5-cheap-cefs-yielding-7/
Time Published: 2025-07-13T11:45:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Travel Destination The last bargains on the big board? Discounted closed-end funds (CEFs). CEFs are often the “last stop” for dividend deals. We are talking about an inefficient corner of the income universe, which is just great for us contrarians—we love the discounts. And these funds can trade for less than “fair value” for months and even years on end. When the markets washed out in April, these CEFs were discarded by their vanilla dividend owners. Let’s pick up the pieces for up to 12% off, or 88 cents on the dollar. And in the process secure yields up to 9.7%. Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX)Distribution Rate: 8.4% We’ll start with the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), an example of a strategy that thrives in CEF land: covered calls. DIAX’s five fund managers attempt to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but with less volatility, by owning the DJIA’s components while also selling call options on between 35% and 75% of the notional value of the equity portfolio. Covered-call funds generally offer the exact same tradeoff: Receive lower volatility and a higher percentage of returns coming from distributions in exchange for lesser overall performance than the underlying index (because DIAX’s holdings are being “called away” as they rise). Unfortunately, in the case of DIAX, the underperformance is stark, even when considering a distribution rate that’s more than 5x the Dow’s dividend yield. We’re generally better off buying funds like DIAX when we think the Dow is toppy. The fund trades at an 11% discount as I write, more than its recent average of 9%. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 8.3% Numerous CEFs turn income-unfriendly segments of the market into distribution funnels. Take the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG), which generates an 8%-plus monthly payout from a few dozen technology, communications, and consumer stocks. While thematic ETFs are a dime a dozen, thematic CEFs like NBXG are few and far between. This Neuberger fund’s theme is next-generation connectivity; managers Hari Ramanan, Yan Taw Boon, and Timothy Creedom seek out stocks that “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But if we take a quick look, it’s pretty apparent NBXG can also stand in as a play on artificial intelligence (AI). Mag 7 holdings such as Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are pretty direct plays on AI at this point. The fund even invests in private companies, such as AI-powered Grammarly. It also engages in options trading to generate gains from options premiums and tamp down on risk. Neuberger’s CEF has trailed the tech sector since inception, though that’s not a terribly fair comparison given its exposure to other sectors. Still, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past 18 months or so: The fund’s discount to NAV is generous, at 11.2% currently, so we have NBXG’s assets selling for 89 cents on the dollar..) Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT)Distribution Rate: 7.5% Another place we might not expect a high-single-digit yield? Small-cap stocks. But that’s exactly what we get from Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT). RMT—managed by Jim Stoeffel and Andrew Palen—is a micro-cap value fund in name, though given an average market cap of about $750 million, it’s truly closer to small-cap in nature. Still, not exactly a who’s who of ballyhooed dividend names. Holdings include the likes of electronic component maker Bel Fuse (BELFA), which pays a fractional yield, and online advertising firm Magnite (MGNI), which pays no dividend whatsoever. So, what’s with the big distribution? RMT doesn’t really trade options, nor does it use debt leverage. Instead, it’s just a quarterly distribution of predominantly long-term capital gains. Not ideal, but RMT pulls it off. I’ve previously pointed out that RMT always trades at a discount, and indeed, it’s trading right around its five-year average discount to NAV (12%). That’s not exactly a good thing—ideally, management should have a plan to close that discount at some point. But it’s hard to knock Royce too much given RMT’s consistent outperformance. Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR)Distribution Rate: 9.7% Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR) is a “portfolio in a can,” capable of investing in stocks and a wide array of bonds and other fixed income, both domestically and internationally. ZTR’s four-manager team has currently built a 75/25 stock/bond portfolio. The equity sleeve is both lopsided and defensive in nature; half of its weight is in utilities, while the rest is largely taken up by industrials and energy firms. On the debt side, ZTR owns investment-grade and junk corporates, emerging-market bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, Treasuries, and more. Like many closed-end funds (but unlike the CEFs above), ZTR amplifies its bets through debt; it currently has 130% of assets invested thanks to debt leverage. Virtus Total Return is considered a “moderate allocation” fund, which refers to funds that typically have between 50% and 70% of their assets invested in stocks (with the rest in bonds and/or cash). While this CEF currently has a 75/25 blend, I’ve seen it as low as 60/40 when looking at it in the past. Still, for comparison’s sake, it’s worth looking at ZTR against a couple different allocation benchmarks—in this case, a 60/40 ETF and a more aggressive 80/20 ETF. Virtus’ fund has enjoyed pockets of outperformance in the past, but the fund has lost an enormous amount of ground recently. Its dips have been harsher than the plain-vanilla ETFs, which is normal for a leveraged CEF, but its recoveries have been more muted—the opposite of what we’d expect. Unfortunately, that blunts the appeal of ZTR’s nearly 10% distribution (paid monthly), as well as a roughly 11% discount to NAV that’s cheaper than its five-year average (8%). Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW)Distribution Rate: 8.4% Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) is a global fund that can invest not just in common stock, but investment-grade corporates, junk corporates, preferred stock, bank loans, convertible debt, asset-backed securities, US government securities, options, and more. At the moment, about two-thirds of assets are invested in common stock, with another 15% in convertibles, 10% in corporate debt, and the rest scattered around the other categories. Geographically speaking, the US accounts for a little more than half of the fund’s assets, with the rest in developed markets like Germany, Japan, and Canada, as well as emerging markets like China and India. On top of all of that, CHW’s five-manager team also utilizes a hefty amount of debt leverage: just south of 30% currently. There aren’t many global allocation funds out there, and those that are simply aren’t built the way CHW is—especially given that management has a long leash and a lot of assets they can explore. But comparisons against the SPDR SSGA Global Allocation ETF (GAL)—an ETF in the same category (global moderate allocation)—are favorable, albeit bumpier. CHW is also trading at a tasty 10.7% discount to NAV that’s more than twice as deep as its five-year average, and it’s doling out an 8%+ distribution, paid monthly.

Bitcoin is flexing its muscle. The S&P 500 Index closed at 6,280 on July 10, 2025, marking a 6% year‑to‑date gain in dollar terms. The benchmark even set fresh records this week. Yet priced in Bitcoin, that same index sits about 15% lower so far this year. That gap shows just how strong crypto’s rally has been. According to market analyst The Kobeissi Letter, measuring the S&P 500 against BTC highlights a dramatic shift. Since 2012, the index has fallen almost a whopping 100% versus Bitcoin, based on data from Bitbo. Investors who stuck with Bitcoin instead of stocks over the past decade would be sitting on massive gains. That contrast has become impossible to ignore. Truly incredible: The S&P 500 in Bitcoin terms is now DOWN -15% year-to-date. Since 2012, the S&P 500 in Bitcoin terms is down -99.98%. We are all witnessing history. https://t.co/DsoHhJQXvo pic.twitter.com/UHETngTqGy — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 11, 2025 Based on figures from CoinMarketCap, BTC pushed past $118,800, Friday. The digital asset climbed 6% in the previous 24 hours and gained 10% over the past week. Overall, BTC is up 26% in 2025. Those numbers have drawn fresh attention from traders who once treated crypto as a fringe bet. In 2025, money has flooded into crypto via exchange‑traded funds in the US. As of this week, the 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs hold a combined 1.26 million BTC—about $148 billion at current prices. That stash represents over 6% of all Bitcoin in circulation, according to Bitbo data. Inflows into digital asset ETFs landed them as the third‑largest fund category in the first half of the year, trailing only short‑term government debt and gold, State Street data shows. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their second‑largest single‑day inflow ever, pulling in over $1 billion. Traders view these ETFs as a simpler way to tap into BTC gains without dealing directly with wallets or exchanges. At the time of writing, Coingecko data shows BTC trading at $118,038—still holding most of its recent upside. Last 10 Years… Bitcoin $BTC: +40,450% NVIDIA $NVDA: +34,815% Tesla $TSLA: +1,702% Netflix $NFLX: +1,206% Microsoft $MSFT: +1,199% Amazon $AMZN: +926% Meta $META: +751% Apple $AAPL: +691% Google $GOOGL: +556% S&P 500 $SPY: +262% Gold $GLD: +175% US Inflation (CPI): +35% — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) July 11, 2025 Bitcoin’s surge hasn’t just outperformed broad stock indexes. Analyst Charlie Bilello has pointed out that BTC has climbed far more than big tech names like Nvidia, Tesla, and Netflix over the past decade. That wider outperformance has added fuel to the argument that digital currency belongs in major portfolios. With US equities near record highs in greenbacks but lagging in Bitcoin terms, some investors are weighing how to balance their bets. The rush into spot ETFs speaks to a growing belief that crypto deserve a spot alongside stocks and bonds.

European Wax Center, Inc. EWCZ has made a decisive pivot to revamp its marketing engine and early signs point to meaningful traction. After implementing a modern advertising effectiveness platform in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, EWCZ reported sequential improvements in new guest trends compared with the same period two years ago. While the lift remains modest, this directional movement is critical for a brand that has struggled to grow traffic in recent quarters.At the core of this transformation is a push toward data-driven, digital-first marketing. With upgraded measurement tools now in place, EWCZ is able to link media impressions to in-center behavior, enabling smarter allocation of marketing dollars and a lower cost per acquisition. Creative and messaging tests are underway, with initial feedback suggesting the brand’s updated identity is resonating, especially among higher-value, more loyal guest segments.This effort goes beyond surface-level branding. Marketing execution is being tightly integrated with franchisee operations through new support tools, enhanced guest communication platforms like email and SMS, and the planned launch of a champion ad campaign during the peak summer season. These coordinated efforts aim to strengthen traffic recovery and unlock additional guest visits. While the initiative is still in early stages, management is confident that the company is gaining momentum and its sharpened marketing engine will drive meaningful traffic and sales growth in the second half of 2025. Coty Inc. COTY continues to evolve its marketing strategy by shifting resources toward high-ROI categories like mass fragrances while scaling back in lower-return color cosmetics. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Coty emphasized influencer-driven content and campaigns, such as its viral Rimmel UK push, to optimize digital reach with lower spend. However, inconsistent category demand and global channel fragmentation are still impacting Coty’s campaign efficiency.Another peer, Helen of Troy Limited HELE, is focusing on simplifying its marketing execution and prioritizing investments that deliver the highest returns. Helen of Troy is refining its paid media funnel, driving more earned media and reducing content costs across brands like Drybar and Curlsmith. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Helen of Troy reported traction in influencer-backed launches and direct-to-consumer growth, but tariff disruptions and pricing pressure continue to weigh on media performance. Shares of European Wax Center have gained 64.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 50.1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, EWCZ trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.61X, below the industry’s average of 27.7X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EWCZ’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 35.6% and 8.2%, respectively.
