Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft can 'breathe a huge sigh of relief' after Trump's China tariff exemptions

The ever-growing U.S. tariffs on imports from China won’t bite Big Tech so badly after all, after the Trump administration late Friday laid out significant exemptions from its wider trade war that include smartphones, laptop computers, chips, and more. The exemptions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, amount to a huge break for tech giants such as Apple (AAPL+4.00%), Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%), and Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%), and for the broader tech industry, even as uncertainty persists over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war. It means some of the most crucial and high-end technology imports — which overwhelmingly aren’t made in the U.S. — won’t be subject to Trump’s 125% tariff on China, or his baseline 10% tariff on almost every other country. A Wall Street analyst quickly called it “the best news possible for tech investors.” “The U.S. tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House, the reality of the situation was finally recognized in the Beltway,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Saturday. “There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations. Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday.” The exemptions follow a pattern from Trump’s first term, when Apple in particular saw significant success in lobbying Trump for trade war carveouts. Making products such as the iPhone in America would be almost economically impossible. Wedbush had warned earlier this month that Apple faced a “complete disaster” from the China tariffs. And the Trump administration’s move came as its trade war has driven days of volatility in financial markets, as well as cratering consumer confidence and growing recession fears. Ives called the exemptions “a big step forward for U.S. tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend. ... Big Tech is back off the cliff with these exemptions and this changes the entire situation for tech stocks with this black swan event for the industry removed.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: UBS: Taiwan’s Surging Exports Imply A Data Center Revenue Of $42 Billion For NVIDIA’s April-Ending Quarter
URL: https://wccftech.com/ubs-taiwan-surging-exports-imply-a-data-center-revenue-of-42-billion-for-nvidia-april-ending-quarter/

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With President Trump's global trade war rapidly morphing into a tit-for-tat tariff-related one-upmanship between the US and China, NVIDIA is now finding itself at the very center of this maelstrom, replete with opportunities and challenges that such a strategic position almost always entails. We got a glimpse of NVIDIA's elevated negotiating power recently when it was able to win an unfettered exemption from the Trump administration to continue selling AI-critical H20 GPUs in China. Now, UBS is out with a fresh note that leverages Taiwan's surging exports - presumably boosted by tariff-related pull-ins - to quantify the upside for NVIDIA's data center sales in the April-ending quarter. To wit, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri notes that Taiwan's exports of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) equipment ex laptops clocked-in at $12.03 billion for March 2025, corresponding to a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 20.6 percent relative to February's export figure of $9.97 billion. Arcuri points out that March is historically the strongest export month for Taiwan, typically recording MoM growth of mid-20 percent over February's figures. This means that Taiwan's export figures for March were a tad weaker than what historical analogs would imply. The UBS analyst, however, takes pains to note that Taiwan just witnessed its "strongest February in over a decade (+14% M/M relative to -15% historical seasonality)." The analyst then asserts: "Assuming April constitutes a "normal" 36% of total F1Q (Apr Q) would imply ~$34B of exports - a large step-up of ~58% Q/Q - although it is unclear to what extent this reflects tariff pull-ins rather than underlying strength." Basically, if Taiwan's April exports follow their historical pattern, the country would likely record a quarter-over-quarter export growth of 58 percent. According to Arcuri, this level of exports would imply an 18 percent quarter-over-quarter growth in NVIDIA's data center revenues: "We model NVDA's data center revenue up 18% Q/Q to $42B in Apr Q." While the UBS analyst cautions that Taiwan's export data has not been predictive of NVIDIA's data center sales for the past few quarters, his overall thesis is bolstered by TSMC recently reporting "above-seasonality" sales for March 2025. Of course, this comes as Citi has just lowered its total GPU sales forecast for NVIDIA by 3 percent for the ongoing CY 2025, and 5 percent for the CY 2026, citing "mostly lower Microsoft capex concerns and higher risk of pause in enterprise investments amid uncertainty around the global economy due to ongoing trade war." Meanwhile, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." Accordingly, Lynx Equity now expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Is NVDA Stock A Bargain At $110?

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

Title: Bitcoin’s Recent Drawdown Proves Its More Than Just a Leveraged Tech Play

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has fallen below 100 and gold has surged to new all-time highs as escalating tariffs have heightened global economic uncertainty. Consequently, asset prices have taken a hit—most notably in the tech sector and cryptocurrencies. Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, bitcoin’s drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown. To highlight bitcoin’s resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly. This comparison underscores how bitcoin has grown more resilient over time as its market cycles progress and the asset continues to mature.

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%), Apple (AAPL+4.00%), Amazon (AMZN+1.90%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-0.59%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+5.21%), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC-1.85%), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR-0.16%), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA+2.68%). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares were brutally bruised in the recent tariff-related turmoil. However, now as President Trump seems to have stepped away from the proverbial precipice, Lynx Equity expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs, accruing outsized benefits for its key supply chain partners - the provider of high-performance memory and storage solutions, Micron, and the retailer of servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI). For the benefit of those who might not be aware, President Trump has now instituted a 10 percent baseline tariff for all major trading partners of the US except China, which is currently subjected to a 125 percent tariff. This situation is expected to persist for the next 90 days, during which the US now expects to conclude agreements with its major trading partners. Bear in mind that the tariffs on the import of vehicles and auto parts into the US persist at 25 percent, as do the import levies on aluminum and steel. For its part, China has imposed a tariff of 84 percent on all imports from the US. .@AnnaEconomist's work suggests roughly similar levels of tariffs under the new announcement. Certainly not looking like a big relief here. pic.twitter.com/C4sRzDv014 — Bob Elliott (@BobEUnlimited) April 10, 2025 Despite the prevailing euphoria, we note that the average tariff rate that the US applies to its imports has not decreased materially despite Trump's off-ramp. This is primarily due to the punitive levies that imports from China still remain subjected to. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." The firm goes on to note: "Due to tariff mitigation plans NVDA has in place, we are now calling for NVDA to return to recent highs, despite potential downside to data center capex expectations." Specifically, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA can viably reach a stock price target of $140, which corresponds to a multiple of 31x to the consensus EPS expectations for the calendar year 2025. Lynx Equity also believes that Micron and Super Micro Computer would accrue outsized benefits from NVIDIA's tariff mitigation strategy: "As part of the NVDA supply chain, we reiterate our preference for MU at $125 PT and SMCI at $60 PT." Finally, the research house also expects Dell to emerge as a relative winner in the prevailing situation. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound Wednesday after President Donald Trump abruptly hit pause on sweeping tariffs for most countries. The 90-day delay — announced shortly after the duties took effect — whipsawed stocks and rocked major indices. But a little more than an hour before markets opened Thursday, stocks looked poised to slump again. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 537 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 futures were off 1.7% and Nasdaq futures were off 2.1%. After Trump announced the pause on Wednesday, the Nasdaq surged 12.1% — its second-biggest daly gain on record — while the Dow jumped more than 3,000 points for the first time in history, closing up 8%. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%. Some of the market’s most battered names led the charge, with Apple (AAPL+4.00%) stock rising 15%, both Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) and Intel (INTC-1.85%) jumping more than 18%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) rallying 23%. Meta (META-0.59%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) also logged double-digit gains, underscoring how sudden, top-down policy reversals don’t just move markets. They redistribute billions of dollars to those positioned — and in fact publicly encouraged — to capitalize. Here’s what to watch on Thursday. CarMax (KMX+1.95%) reports earnings Thursday morning, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.66 on $5.97 billion in revenue — up sharply from $0.32 per share a year ago. As the top U.S. used car seller, CarMax is a key gauge of consumer health. Used car sales straddle interest rates, credit access, and household budgets, making them a prime barometer of macro pressure. Softening demand or tighter lending could flag middle-class strain, especially among subprime buyers. And with CarMax offering in-house financing, any signs of rising delinquencies or tightened credit standards may echo the recessionary signals analysts fear could appear in bank earnings Friday. The first major financial firms to report, BlackRock (BLK+3.01%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+2.05%), will kick off bank earnings season Friday morning. BlackRock’s results are expected to shed light on investor risk appetite and ETF flow trends in a choppy bond market. That’s because few institutions offer a clearer window into where money is actually moving. BlackRock reflects bond market demand primarily through its fixed income fund flows. As the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion AUM, it runs a massive range of ETFs and mutual funds that track everything from short-term Treasuries to junk bonds. If investors are running from risk — or chasing yield — BlackRock’s books may demonstrate the shift. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, offers a read on the health of deal-making and IPO activity — both of which have slowed amid rising rates and global uncertainty. Together, the two are likely to set the tone for how Wall Street is navigating 2025’s volatile whiplash economy.

The sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration — including a 104% duty on Chinese imports — have one analyst calling the move an “Armageddon scenario” for the U.S. technology sector. That’s according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who warned Wednesday that President Donald Trump’s tariffs “will go down as the worst U.S. policy mistake” since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which deepened the Great Depression. Ives said the tariffs will significantly affect the U.S. tech sector because the “hearts and lungs of the supply chain are cemented in Asia.” He wrote, “A U.S. tech company CEO cannot decide last night... ‘Lets call Smith Semi Fab Operations in the Midwest to get those semi chips’... as there is one slight problem... IT DOES NOT EXIST... and would take 4-5 years to build a manufacturing plant... and the labor force does not support this in the U.S.... the IP of the supply chain is cemented in Asia after 30 years of making U.S. tech products... and the products will go up 3x-4x once implemented after years... being paid by the U.S. consumers/companies.” Ives added, “‘Debacle’ is an understatement for this tariff policy.” The “self-inflicted uncertainty” of the tariffs has “turned the global supply chain upside-down, and U.S. consumers are the ones paying,” according to Ives. He doesn’t expect any tech companies to give guidance on first-quarter conference calls, given all the uncertainty. Still, he recommends owning stocks in Apple (AAPL+4.00%) and Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) because “despite this massive, near-term uncertainty, it does not change their installed base, technology leadership, and long-term growth opportunities, especially with Nvidia leading the AI industry.” Apple is down 20% since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on the so-called “Liberation Day” on April 2 and 28% year-to-date. Nvidia is down 10% since the recent tariff announcement and 26% year-to-date. Ives said Wedbush will stay fluid. The firm work under the assumption that the tariffs in their current form will stick around for a few months and will adjust its numbers as the tariffs change or remain. The Wedbush analyst recommends tossing out the next few quarters (June and September) and working with new financial models for 2026 for valuations as the tariff situation gets negotiated. Ives said his firm has a worst-, base-, and bull-case framework that it’s using to screen tech stocks; that’s how Wedbush will “navigate this unprecedented situation” and hold investors’ hands over the coming days and weeks. “Market volatility and nervousness has been one of the highest I have seen in 25 years on this job covering tech stocks on the Street,” Ives said. “Now, the question is what is next and how to navigate this Category 5 storm tariff coming to the U.S economy.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Investors were digesting the latest volley in the U.S.-China trade fight early Wednesday, with a 104% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and other tech goods taking effect overnight. The renewed trade tension added fresh anxiety to a day already packed with earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL+3.51%) and Constellation Brands (STZ+0.70%), worrying signals from Walmart (WMT+2.42%) and Apple (AAPL+4.00%), and a wave of big-bank results on deck. Premarket moves among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were broadly lower Wednesday, with Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) off 1% and Apple slipping 2% in early trading. Amazon (AMZN+1.90%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%), and Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum. Bond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.” Delta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading. But while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses. Constellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool. Early Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers. Meanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen. Once a national discount heavyweight, Big Lots was delisted from the NYSE late last year and now trades as a penny stock. Its collapse adds to the growing wave of “retail wreckage” — from Red Lobster’s closures to Macy’s and Foot Locker (FL-4.28%), both of which are shuttering hundreds of stores across the country. Together, these developments highlight the pressure facing retailers: rising input costs, unpredictable trade policy, and a consumer base increasingly cautious about spending. The first-quarter results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) and Wells Fargo (WFC-0.63%) land Friday. Analysts will be watching for loan growth, consumer credit quality, and recession contingency plans. With rate cut expectations pushed deeper into the year, margin commentary will be critical. These earnings may also help set the tone for Q2 investor sentiment.

Title: Google's 'Ironwood' TPU aims squarely at the high cost of inference

During its Google Cloud Next 25 event Wednesday, the search giant unveiled the latest version of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the custom chip built to run artificial intelligence -- with a twist. Also: Why Google Code Assist may finally be the programming power tool you need For the first time, Google is positioning the chip for inference, the making of predictions for live requests from millions or even billions of users, as opposed to training, the development of neural networks carried out by teams of AI specialists and data scientists. The Ironwood TPU, as the new chip is called, arrives at an economic inflection point in AI. The industry clearly expects AI moving forward to be less about science projects and more about the actual use of AI models by companies. And the rise of DeepSeek AI has focused Wall Street more than ever on the enormous cost of building AI for Google and its competitors. The rise of "reasoning" AI models, such as Google's Gemini, which dramatically increases the number of statements generated by a large language model, creates a sudden surge in the total computing needed to make predictions. As Google put it in describing Ironwood, "reasoning and multi-step inference is shifting the incremental demand for compute -- and therefore cost -- from training to inference time (test-time scaling)." Also: Think DeepSeek has cut AI spending? Think again Thus, Ironwood is a statement by Google that its focus on performance and efficiency is shifting to reflect the rising cost of inference versus the research domain of training. Google has been developing its TPU family of chips for over a decade through six prior generations. However, training chips are generally considered a much lower-volume chip market than inference. That is because training demands rise only as each new, gigantic GenAI research project is inaugurated, which is generally once a year or so. In contrast, inference is expected to meet the needs of thousands or millions of customers who want day-to-day predictions from the trained neural network. Inference is considered a high-volume market in the chip world. Google had previously made the case that the sixth-generation Trillium TPU, introduced last year, which became generally available in December, could serve as both a training and an inference chip in one part, emphasizing its ability to speed up the serving of predictions. In fact, as far back as the TPU version two, in 2017, Google had talked of a combined ability for training and inference. Also: Google reveals new Kubernetes and GKE enhancements for AI innovation The positioning of Ironwood as mainly an inference chip, first and foremost, is a departure. It's a shift that may also mark a change in Google's willingness to rely on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia as the workhorse of its AI computing fleet. In the past, Google had described the TPU as a necessary investment to achieve cutting-edge research results but not an alternative to its vendors. In Google's cloud computing operations, based on the number of "instances" run by customers, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia chips make up a combined 99% of processors used, versus less than a percent for the TPU, according to research by KeyBanc Capital Markets. That reliance on three dominant vendors has economic implications for Google and the other giants, Microsoft and Amazon. Also: 10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next Wall Street stock analysts, who compile measures of Google's individual lines of business, have, from time to time, calculated the economic value of the TPU. For example, in January, stock analyst Gil Luria of the boutique research firm DA Davidson wrote that "Google would have generated as much as $24 billion of revenue last year if it was selling TPUs as hardware to NVDA [Nvidia] customers," meaning in competition with Nvidia. Conversely, at a time when the cost of AI escalates into multi-hundred-billion-dollar projects such as Stargate, Wall Street analysts believe that Google's TPU could offer the company a way to save money on the cost of AI infrastructure. Also: DeepSeek's new open-source AI model can outperform o1 for a fraction of the cost Although Google has paid chip-maker Broadcom to help it take each new TPU into commercial production, Google might still save money using more TPUs versus the price it has to pay to Intel, AMD, and Nvidia to consume ever-larger fleets of chips for inference. To make the case for Ironwood, Google on Wednesday emphasized the technical advances of Ironwood versus Trillium. Google said Ironwood gets twice the "performance per watt" of Trillium, as measured by 29.3 trillion floating-point math operations per second. The Ironwood part has 192GB of DRAM memory, dubbed HBM, or high-bandwidth memory, six times as much as Trillium. The memory bandwidth transmitted is 4.5 times as much, 7.2 terabits per second. Also: Nvidia dominates in gen AI benchmarks, clobbering 2 rival AI chips Google said those enhancements are supposed to support much greater movement of data in and out of the chip and between systems. "Ironwood is designed to minimize data movement and latency on chip while carrying out massive tensor manipulations," said Google. The memory and bandwidth advances are all part of Google's emphasis on "scaling" its AI infrastructure. The meaning of scaling is to be able to fully use each chip when grouping together hundreds or thousands of chips to work on a problem in parallel. More chips dedicated to the same problem should lead to a concomitant speed-up in performance. Again, scaling has an economic component. By effectively grouping chips, the TPUs can achieve greater "utilization," the amount of a given resource that is actually used versus the amount being left idle. Successful scaling means higher utilization of chips, which is good because it means less waste of an expensive resource. Also: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles That's why, in the past, Google has emphasized Trillium's ability to "scale to hundreds of thousands of chips" in a collection of machines. While Google didn't give explicit details on Ironwood's scaling performance on inference tasks, it once again emphasized on Wednesday the ability of "hundreds of thousands of Ironwood chips to be composed together to rapidly advance the frontiers of GenAI computation." Also: Intel's new CEO vows to run chipmaker 'as a startup, on day one' Google's announcement came with a significant software announcement as well, Pathways on Cloud. The Pathways software is code that distributes parts of the AI computing work to different computers. It had been used internally by Google and is now being made available to the public.

It's a shift that may also mark a change in Google's willingness to rely on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia as the workhorse of its AI computing fleet. In the past, Google had described the TPU as a necessary investment to achieve cutting-edge research results but not an alternative to its vendors. In Google's cloud computing operations, based on the number of "instances" run by customers, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia chips make up a combined 99% of processors used, versus less than a percent for the TPU, according to research by KeyBanc Capital Markets. That reliance on three dominant vendors has economic implications for Google and the other giants, Microsoft and Amazon. Also: 10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next Wall Street stock analysts, who compile measures of Google's individual lines of business, have, from time to time, calculated the economic value of the TPU. For example, in January, stock analyst Gil Luria of the boutique research firm DA Davidson wrote that "Google would have generated as much as $24 billion of revenue last year if it was selling TPUs as hardware to NVDA [Nvidia] customers," meaning in competition with Nvidia. Conversely, at a time when the cost of AI escalates into multi-hundred-billion-dollar projects such as Stargate, Wall Street analysts believe that Google's TPU could offer the company a way to save money on the cost of AI infrastructure. Also: DeepSeek's new open-source AI model can outperform o1 for a fraction of the cost Although Google has paid chip-maker Broadcom to help it take each new TPU into commercial production, Google might still save money using more TPUs versus the price it has to pay to Intel, AMD, and Nvidia to consume ever-larger fleets of chips for inference. To make the case for Ironwood, Google on Wednesday emphasized the technical advances of Ironwood versus Trillium. Google said Ironwood gets twice the "performance per watt" of Trillium, as measured by 29.3 trillion floating-point math operations per second. The Ironwood part has 192GB of DRAM memory, dubbed HBM, or high-bandwidth memory, six times as much as Trillium. The memory bandwidth transmitted is 4.5 times as much, 7.2 terabits per second. Also: Nvidia dominates in gen AI benchmarks, clobbering 2 rival AI chips Google said those enhancements are supposed to support much greater movement of data in and out of the chip and between systems. "Ironwood is designed to minimize data movement and latency on chip while carrying out massive tensor manipulations," said Google. The memory and bandwidth advances are all part of Google's emphasis on "scaling" its AI infrastructure. The meaning of scaling is to be able to fully use each chip when grouping together hundreds or thousands of chips to work on a problem in parallel. More chips dedicated to the same problem should lead to a concomitant speed-up in performance. Again, scaling has an economic component. By effectively grouping chips, the TPUs can achieve greater "utilization," the amount of a given resource that is actually used versus the amount being left idle. Successful scaling means higher utilization of chips, which is good because it means less waste of an expensive resource.

While Google didn't give explicit details on Ironwood's scaling performance on inference tasks, it once again emphasized on Wednesday the ability of "hundreds of thousands of Ironwood chips to be composed together to rapidly advance the frontiers of GenAI computation."

The Pathways software is code that distributes parts of the AI computing work to different computers. It had been used internally by Google and is now being made available to the public.
