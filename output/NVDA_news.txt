Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to grow further. Shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led gains on the S&P 500, adding to their recent rally in the wake of a deal with OpenAI. Dell Technology (DELL) also jumped, after the server maker reported yesterday that it sees a “massive” growth opportunity in AI as it raised its outlook. AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) shares soared to a record high as the provider of space-based cellphone service and Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed on a partnership to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. Credit score data provider Fair Isaac (FICO) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after score reporter Equifax (EFX) slashed prices in response to Fair Isaac providing its information directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage companies. Equifax shares advanced. DaVita (DVA) shares declined as Barclays lowered its price target for the kidney dialysis service provider's stock, pointing to a cyberattack that disrupted operations in August. Gold prices high a fresh high, and oil futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar was higher versus the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.

Title: The 6%+ Dividends To Buy As AI Surges And Layoffs Arrive

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. By now, it’s glaringly obvious: AI is replacing workers. And it’s boosting corporate bottom lines as it does. I call this the “growth-without-hiring” trend, and it’s accelerating. Today we’re going to grab our share in the form of big dividends (up to 8.1%) and upside, too. The latest evidence that “growth without hiring” is the real deal? The September ADP payrolls report, which showed that companies cut 32,000 positions. The August numbers were also revised to 3,000 losses, not the 54,000 gains originally reported. With numbers like those, you’d expect the US to be in recession, or close to it. Nope. According to the Atlanta Fed’s up-to-the-minute GDPNow indicator, the economy grew a fit 3.8% annualized in the just-completed third quarter. Numbers from companies themselves back up this shift. IT consulting firm Accenture plc (ACN), for example, laid off more than 11,000 employees in the last three months and has said more cuts are coming as part of its AI-focused restructuring. But while Accenture’s workers pack their banker’s boxes, its profits are soaring: In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, revenue jumped 7%. For fiscal 2026, it expects a 2% to 5% revenue boost and a 5% to 8% increase in adjusted EPS. (Too bad ACN’s 2.6% divvie isn’t enough to get our hearts racing.) We’ve talked about this trend before, first in tech and then as it’s spread into other industries, including insurance and even agriculture. And this is where our dividend opportunity comes in, including that shot at payouts up to 8.1%. To be sure, that payout is not coming from the popular AI plays. I probably don’t have to tell you that NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) pay somewhere between nothing and almost nothing. Instead, we’re buying through closed-end funds (CEFs), for three reasons: That last point is vital because most of the profits from AI will flow to companies that use the tech, rather than those that develop it. Accenture is a good example, but think of insurers using AI to read medical records and process claims in minutes. Or banks using it to make better decisions on exactly who they want to lend to—and who they don’t. With that, here are three CEFs that come at it through developers, users and (our sweetest dividend deal of the three) firms feeding AI’s bottomless power demand. QQQX, as the name says, holds the stocks in the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: to the tune of 8.1%. The fund can pay that high divvie thanks to its strategy of selling call options on its portfolio. Under this scheme, it sells option buyers the right to buy its stocks in the future at a fixed price. It keeps the fee it charges for that right. Hence, that healthy 8.1% payout. This strategy generates the most cash when markets are volatile, and more volatility is likely, considering the rocket ride stocks have been on. QQQX’s portfolio includes all the big tech kingpins, plus some firms on the user side of AI, too, like travel-site operator Booking Holdings (BKG), which uses AI to help travelers save time by letting them ask specific questions about a vacation property—like whether it has a beach view, for example. It also offers an AI summary of reviews. No more endless scrolling. The fund also sports an 8.2% discount as I write this, which is good … but not quite as good as it was earlier this year, when it sunk to double digits: That’s why I rate QQQX, a holding in my Contrarian Income Report advisory, a hold for now. Once it flips to a buy in our portfolio, members of the service will know right away. “Growth-Without-Hiring” Dividend #2: Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund (KYN) Artificial intelligence is supposed to be graceful, just code humming in the cloud. Yet it’s anything but lightweight. AI is an energy hog. Every time a chatbot like ChatGPT spits out an answer, it pulls from enormous racks of servers running in data centers. Those servers draw power on the scale of small cities. AI can’t happen without natural gas. Renewables are growing, for sure, but most new data centers are still tied to gas-fired plants. Gas is abundant and reliable, and it fires up quickly when demand surges. Which means every new AI deployment is more business for the gas lines feeding those power plants. KYN is a savvy CEF play on this situation, sporting a portfolio that reads like a who’s-who of big US pipeline operators, including Kinder Morgan (KMI), ONEOK (OKE) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) like Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). (Bonus: With KYN, you get a simple form 1099 for reporting your dividends at tax time, not the complicated K-1 package you—or your accountant—would have to deal with if you bought these MLPs “direct”.) KYN collects “tolls” on the gas flowing through its holdings’ pipes and hands them to us as a 7.5% divvie. And while plenty of investors have made the connection between AI’s power needs and utility stocks, they haven’t yet made the leap to pipelines. That’s handed us “second-level” thinkers a likely-time-limited chance to buy KYN an 11%-off deal that’s actually gotten cheaper this year: My take? It’s only a matter of time before the “first-level” crowd realizes just how good AI will be for gas pipelines—and sends that discount hurtling toward a premium. GDV focuses on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses. Top holdings include Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and American Express (AXP). GDV yields 6.2% and hasn’t cut its payout since the 2008 financial crisis. The fund’s discount had been narrowing lately, but it recently widened to 11%, giving us another chance to get in cheap: I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance. GDV is an especially sweet deal when you consider that the fund has been outperforming the S&P 500 on a total-return basis this year: 18% to 15% as I write this. Throw in a tailwind from “growth-without-hiring”—especially as the trend spreads from tech to other parts of the economy—and you get a sense of the opportunity for upside (and high, steady dividends) here.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a number of partners that could be set to benefit from its big deal with OpenAI, according to Wall Street analysts. The ChatGPT maker committed to buying several generations of AMD's AI chips, sending shares of the semiconductor firm up 24% yesterday and another 4% on Tuesday. The announcement also boosted shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), Dell Technologies (DELL), and others that have business with AMD. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see current AMD partners and AI server makers Supermicro, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as poised to gain from the deal. They also highlighted Arista Networks (ANET) and Sanmina (SANM), which earlier this year agreed to buy ZT Systems’ Data Center Infrastructure manufacturing business from AMD and became a preferred manufacturing partner as part of the agreement. Several analysts suggested AMD's deal could be taken as a positive signal for the semiconductor sector and AI trade broadly, though they pointed to some of AMD's networking partners as more direct beneficiaries. The deal underscores the wide-ranging impact of the surge in AI demand on companies and stocks, with analysts likening the AI boom to a rising tide that lifts all boats. "While the announcements till date from OpenAI have largely focused on tight partnerships with semiconductor companies, we expect to see similar partnerships with Hardware and Networking companies as critical to scaling infrastructure," J.P. Morgan said. Citi analysts said they see AMD's OpenAI agreement as presenting a positive read-through for memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) and Astera Labs as well. Astera, which supplies connectivity solutions for AI data centers and counts Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD as customers, saw its stock pop 10% Monday, before pulling back Tuesday.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares rose Tuesday after soaring yesterday to a 19-month high on news that the chip designer and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have inked a multi-year supply deal. Under the agreement, OpenAI is committing to buying several generations of AI chips from AMD in a long-term deal that could see it take a 10% stake in the Nvidia (NVDA) rival. AMD said it anticipates the ripple effect of the deal to net it more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers. AMD shares, which jumped 24% on Monday, were up more than 5% at around $215 in recent trading, putting the stock on pace for a record closing high. The stock is up 77% since the start of the year, handily outpacing Nvidia’s 40% return over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify critical price levels worth watching out for. AMD shares staged a dramatic breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Monday, laying the groundwork for follow-through buying. While the surge coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below peaks that preceded drawdowns in November 2021 and March 2024. However, the stock closed near its low for the day yesterday, indicating a short-term over-extension. Let’s point out two critical overhead areas to watch on AMD’s chart if the shares continue their bullish run and also identify support levels worth monitoring during potential pullbacks. If the chipmaker’s shares regain their upward momentum, investors should initially keep track of the $227 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near Monday's high, which coincidently sits just below the stock’s record intraday high set in March last year. Investors can project an overhead area to watch above the stock’s all-time high by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the study to AMD’s chart, we calculate the distance from the inverse head and shoulders’ head to neckline in points and add that amount to the pattern’s neckline. For example, adding $98 to $174 projects a bullish target of $272, about 34% above Monday's closing price. During retracements, it’s worth watching for a potential fill of yesterday's stock gap down to around $174. Investors would likely see this as a high probability buying area near the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which could flip from prior resistance to future support. Finally, a steeper pullback would open the door to a retest of the $150 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the inverse head and shoulders’ two shoulders, which closely align with the December 2023 high.

Title: Nvidia Stock 2x To $350?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/07/nvidia-stock-2x-to-350/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T09:30:26Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Will Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) reach $350 in the upcoming years? This likelihood is more than mere speculation. In the last six months alone, Nvidia’s share price has almost doubled, soaring from around $94 per share to nearly $185. At first sight, trading at approximately 42x consensus adjusted FY’26 earnings and 62x for FY’25, the stock may seem expensive. However, considering Nvidia's remarkable earnings growth (with EPS anticipated to increase by nearly 50% this year), its leading role in accelerated computing, and the substantial potential for AI adoption, the valuation begins to appear more justifiable. CEO Jensen Huang foresees that spending on AI infrastructure could rise to $4 trillion by the decade's conclusion, and if artificial general intelligence (AGI) materializes even partially, the need for high-performance computing could soar. Below, we illustrate a possible path indicating how Nvidia’s revenue, profitability, and valuation multiples could elevate its stock to over $350 per share, nearing a $10 trillion market cap. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia’s revenues have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, while achieving an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the previous three years, and this momentum could persist. If Nvidia increases its sales at an average annual rate of approximately 60% for the next two years and around 45% in the third year—its revenues could rise from about $131 billion in FY’25 to roughly $486 billion by FY’28, or nearly 3.7x. Several trends could continue to fuel Nvidia’s growth. While the initial AI models implemented by companies like OpenAI in 2022 were mainly text-based, AI is increasingly evolving to be multimodal—handling speech, images, video, and even 3D—which necessitates greater computing power and a higher quantity of GPU shipments. Activity in AI deal-making shows no signs of deceleration. In the past three months, Nvidia has completed some of its most significant AI-related agreements, including a $100 billion investment and partnership with OpenAI, covering the provision of advanced AI chips and an equity stake, a $6.3 billion cloud capacity agreement with CoreWeave, and Microsoft’s $19.4 billion contract with Nebius, which secures access to nearly 100,000 of Nvidia’s latest GPU chips to boost its AI capabilities. Separately, see How SOUN Stock Falls To $2? The next significant tech revolution could be AGI—Artificial General Intelligence—and Nvidia is positioned at the core of it. Though the timeline is uncertain, the objective is to enable AI to reason, plan, and learn new tasks without requiring retraining. Artificial General Intelligence could conduct scientific research, generate innovative insights, or design complete products independently. This potential could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across various industries, with some models suggesting that AGI could elevate global GDP growth from low single-digit percentages to over 20% annually. [1] As the world approaches AGI, Nvidia stands to gain significantly. AGI will require immense computing power to train and operate, far exceeding current AI models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are the gold standard for these high-performance functions. Combining this robust revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, expressed as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trend—they increased from approximately 25% in FY’19 to around 51% in FY’25 as the company benefited from enhanced economies of scale and a more favorable product mix biased toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also on the rise. We can assume that margins will remain stable at current levels since Nvidia's introduction of pricier high-end products, such as the latest Blackwell chips, is offset by potentially increased costs and competition in the low-end market from competitors like AMD. With margins staying steady and revenue increasing 3.7x, we could witness earnings rise 3.7x. If earnings increase by 3.7x, the PE multiple will decline by 3.7x to approximately 18x, assuming the stock price remains constant. But that’s precisely what Nvidia investors are betting will not occur. If earnings grow 3.7x over the next few years, instead of the trailing PE decreasing from around 62x currently to roughly 18x, a situation where the PE metric remains around 32x appears quite probable. For context, Apple—a company experiencing low single-digit growth—trades at 30x. This scenario could mean Nvidia's stock could grow by approximately 1.9x within the next three years or so, a tangible possibility, leading to a share price exceeding $350. What about the timeline for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t significantly matter whether it takes three years or four, as long as Nvidia continues on this revenue growth trajectory, coupled with margins holding steady, the stock price could respond accordingly. As always, investing in a single company stock carries risk. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a blend of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns for investors. The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a flexible approach to capitalize on bullish markets while minimizing drawdowns, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Little Movement Predicted For Malaysia Shares

The Malaysia stock market on Friday snapped the five-day winning streak in which it had rallied more than 35 points or 2.2 percent. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index now sits just above the 1,635-point plateau and it figures to remain in that neighborhood again on Monday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion. The KLCI finished slightly lower on Friday following losses from the telecoms and mixed performances from the financial shares and property stocks. For the day, the index slipped 2.74 points or 0.17 percent to finish at 1,635.06 after trading between 1,631.43 and 1,658.73. Among the actives, 99 Speed Mart Retail rallied 1.39 percent, while AMMB Holdings sank 0.68 percent, Celcomdigi lost 0.54 percent, CIMB Group climbed 1.05 percent, Gamuda dipped 0.18 percent, IHH Healthcare tanked 1.57 percent, IOI Corporation gathered 0.25 percent, Kuala Lumpur Kepong stumbled 1.66 percent, Maxis rose 0.27 percent, Maybank and PPB Group both perked 0.20 percent, MISC added 0.54 percent, MRDIY jumped 1.20 percent, Nestle Malaysia and Hong Leong Bank both eased 0.10 percent, Petronas Chemicals advanced 0.94 percent, Petronas Dagangan increased 0.78 percent, Petronas Gas gained 0.43 percent, Press Metal shed 0.67 percent, Public Bank dropped 0.69 percent, QL Resources improved 0.92 percent, Sunway fell 0.34 percent, Telekom Malaysia slumped 0.70 percent, Tenaga Nasional tumbled 1.34 percent and YTL Corporation, YTL Power, RHB Bank, Sime Darby, SD Guthrie and Axiata were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street offers little clarity as the major averages opened higher on Friday but went off in different directions to finish mixed. The Dow jumped 238.58 points or 0.51 percent to finish at a record 46,758.28, while the NASDAQ sank 63.59 points or 0.28 percent to end at 22,780.51 and the S&P 500 perked 0.44 points or 0.01 percent to close at 6,715.79, also a record. For the week, the NASDAQ rallied 1.3 percent, while the Dow and the S&P both rose 1.1 percent. The NASDAQ sank on weakness from technology shares such as Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). The lackluster performance by the broader markets came as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to the indefinite delay of key U.S. economic data, including Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report. However, weak data from non-government sources has increased confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates in the coming months. Crude oil prices advanced on Friday amid U.S. dollar weakness as the government shutdown persisted. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up $0.41 or 0.68 percent at $60.89 per barrel. For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com October 03, 2025 16:10 ET First half of this week the focus was on efforts to avoid a government shutdown in the U.S. However, talks to avert one failed and an almost total blackout of federal government began on October 1, Wednesday. The weekly claims data due on Thursday and the job report on Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not released. In Europe, inflation data in the euro area raised concern and the latest interest rate decision from India was among the main news in Asia.

Micron Technology's (MU) stock has had a strong run in 2025 so far, and some Wall Street bulls say it's set to move. higher, as AI-driven orders grow. The memory chip maker's shares were up about 3% to around $193 in recent trading, extending their recent rally and putting them on track to top Friday's closing record. The stock has added more than half its value since the year began, making it one of the S&P 500's top performers for 2025. Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from a neutral rating on Monday, and lifted their price target to $220 from $160, a bit above the $196 average target compiled by Visible Alpha, pointing to booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory to support AI. "Conviction from our purchasing contacts is very high," the analysts said, adding "we see more room to run." Many of the S&P 500's top performers this year are companies that make data storage or memory products needed to support AI data centers, like Micron, and stand to benefit from the same tailwinds. Micron, which counts leading AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) among its partners, last month posted record quarterly sales, thanks in large part to growth from its data center business. AMD announced a massive deal on Monday with OpenAI that sent its stock soaring nearly 30% in recent trading. The news also helped lift shares of partner stocks like Micron and Astera Labs (ALAB), which saw its stock jump 11%.
