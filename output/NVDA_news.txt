ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 02: (L to R) U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as his nominee for the ... More chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Fire Powell? Keep him around? The question never seems to go away—and the markets, fueled by the so-called “TACO” trade (“Trump always chickens out,” as the acronym goes), are shrugging it all off. But what if Trump calls Wall Street’s bluff? Luckily, there are not one but three ways for us to hedge ourselves from the “TACO trade” going cold. Below, we’ll look at all three and I’ll name my favorite of this trio. Plus we’ll grab ourselves tidy dividends of 7%+, too. If you’re experiencing déjà vu, it’s because this same story happened back in April, and it sent stocks plunging back then. This latest time, however, it’s had little impact at all. But why would stocks sell off based on Powell’s firing in the first place? It’s because of the Federal Reserve’s independence. Its operation of the country’s banking and financial system without intervention from the executive branch has been a mainstay since the central bank’s creation a century ago. And Wall Street wants things to stay that way. So, can we march forward into the future without worrying that Powell will be replaced and a new Fed chair will be inserted who bows to political pressure? This, after all, could increase the odds that interest rates will be cut too much—as low rates are popular—potentially goosing inflation in the process. In the long term, yes—the chances of a “new normal,” where the Fed just does what the president says, are basically zero. But in the short term, a selloff driven by this risk is a distinct possibility. That’s because, over the last few weeks, markets have become increasingly complacent, and stocks have gone from volatile to solidly positive. As I write this, the S&P 500 is up 7.8% for 2025, which is about where it should be, in my view. And I expect it to end 2025 higher still. But the VIX, the market’s “fear gauge,” soared in April, slowly fell back down, and is now a bit lower than where it started the year. In other words, the markets are now saying that stocks are less risky than they were at the start of 2025—even after all the talk about tariffs firing Powell, neither of which have fully gone away. Why? Because now the markets are banking on the TACO trade: If Trump keeps “chickening out,” as the acronym goes, he can be easily ignored. However, this is, paradoxically, a risk. Whatever your politics, it’s undeniable that Trump follows the equity markets and responds to them. Stocks recovered only after Trump backed off on the tariffs in April, which he did only after stocks fell. Stock market performance clearly matters a lot to Trump. As a result, we’re in a weird situation where a continued stock rally could encourage Trump to reverse moves that caused the market to tumble in the past. That would likely cause another drop, which could then prompt Trump to reverse course. As of now, stocks are simply jumping to the last step, rising on the assumption Trump will always back off. Which, ironically, gives him exactly the room he needs to do things that will cause stocks to fall, like firing Powell, for example. It’s all a bit exhausting! But this is where those funds I mentioned earlier come in. Right now, volatility itself is low, and that means any kind of “insurance” on the market hitting another storm is cheaper than normal. The “insurance” I want to tell you about today comes in the form of closed-end funds (CEFs) that buy or sell options on the stocks they hold. Under this strategy, these funds charge a fee, called a “premium,” to option traders for the right to buy the stocks in their portfolios at a fixed date and price in the future. They then use the premiums they collect to fund their dividends, which, as we’ll see shortly, are well north of 7%. This strategy works best in volatile markets—which means today’s lower volatility has put many of our favorite covered-call funds on sale. The three “go-to” covered-call CEFs out there are the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), which, as the name says, holds the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average; the S&P 500–focused Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX); and the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Between them, they provide broad exposure to the biggest companies in America, like Visa (V), Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). In other words, many of the same names you’d get if you bought an index fund. But with this trio, we’re getting much higher yields than any index fund pays. And second, unlike ETFs, CEFs (including these three) can trade at a “discount to NAV,” or net asset value. That’s another way of saying we can buy shares of their portfolios for less than they’re actually worth. Covered Call CEFs QQQX tends to be my favorite of these because it often yields the most and has the highest discount. But right now, it yields essentially the same as DIAX, while DIAX offers a much wider discount. That makes DIAX the best buy of the lot today. SPXX, with its 7.5% yield, isn’t generous enough with its dividend, and its discount of 1.3% is almost nonexistent. So if you want to stay in stocks (or stock-focused funds—which we do!) and hedge for future volatility, DIAX is the way to go. Consider also this chart. DIAX Lags On a NAV basis (or going by the performance of its underlying portfolio), DIAX (in purple above) was pretty closely matching its underlying Dow Jones Industrial Average index (in orange) until late April, when a sudden drop in volatility caused DIAX’s portfolio to underperform, and its underperformance has widened since. That’s an opportunity for a contrarian pickup, especially given the fund’s unusually large discount. DIAX Discount to NAV Back in 2022, when volatility was peaking, DIAX saw a flurry of demand. But as stocks have recovered, more money has flowed to alternatives, setting this fund’s discount roughly between 11% and 13%, where it’s been for over a year now. That’s unusual for DIAX, whose average discount has been 6.7% over the last decade. That makes DIAX a timely contrarian play on a rise in volatility, since its covered-call strategy makes it rise as markets get more skittish—and investors look for more “insurance” from the next big plunge.

Intel (INTC) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating a sizable move from the struggling chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Intel's stock could move more than 7% from its recent level near $23 by the end Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares above $24 at the upper end, their highest level since March, or drag them down to $21 at the lower end, about where they were a month ago. Intel's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 11% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. In April, shares fell 7% the day after earnings as the chipmaker issued a quarterly forecast below analysts’ expectations. Heading into Thursday's report, all 11 brokers covering Intel tracked by Visible Alpha have a neutral rating for the stock, with an average price target near $23. Analysts on average expect Intel’s quarterly revenue and profits to have declined year-over-year, with attention squarely on how new CEO Lip-Bu Tan will manage—or sell off—the chipmaker’s struggling foundry business. Tan is reportedly considering changing what manufacturing process the foundry business focuses on, a move that would cost the company hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, but could help win major customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Intel's stock had added about 13% in 2025 so far, but has still lost more than one-quarter of its value from this time last year.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is set to post second-quarter earnings after the market closes today, with investors likely to be watching its cloud and advertising revenue growth for signs of the tech giant's competitiveness amid the AI boom. Jefferies analysts said they expect Google's cloud business to benefit from strong enterprise demand and AI momentum, while analysts at Wedbush recently cautioned that the Magnificent Seven member’s advertising revenue could face challenges from a shift to generative AI search. Wall Street broadly expects Google Cloud revenue to have jumped 26% year-over-year to $13.14 billion, according to Visible Alpha, while the Street projects revenue from Google’s Search and Other division to have risen about 9% to $52.93 billion. Total revenue is expected to have increased 11% to $94.01 billion. Of the 19 analysts covering Alphabet tracked by Visible Alpha, 15 have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, alongside four "hold" ratings. Shares of Alphabet were down about 1% in recent trading, and the stock is roughly flat for 2025. Options pricing data suggests traders expect Alphabet stock could see a sizable move by the end of the week. Alphabet is joined by fellow Mag 7 company Tesla (TSLA) in reporting earnings Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are set to report next Wednesday, with Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) expected to follow a day later. Nvidia (NVDA) isn't slated to report until late August.

Title: Meme Stocks Are Back—Should You Be Worried?

Meme stocks are back in the spotlight. Shares of apparel retailer Kohl’s (KSS) opened nearly 90% higher Tuesday and online home buying website Opendoor’s (OPEN) shares popped nearly 20% at the open. Neither shared any business updates, but both were major topics of conversation on r/wallstreetbets, the subreddit that fueled the meme stock craze of 2021. As in 2021, a short squeeze may have been the culprit for the Tuesday morning spike. Nearly 50% of Kohl’s shares were sold short at the end of June, according to data from FactSet. The stock’s rising price could have forced some short sellers to cover their position by buying the stock, adding to the demand driving up its price. Tuesday's squeeze was relatively short-lived. Kohl’s stock pared its gains throughout the session’s first 30 minutes and ended the day 38% higher. Opendoor, which more than doubled in value last week and gained another 40% Monday, finished Tuesday's session down 10%. Come Wednesday morning, meme traders were hunting for new opportunities. Shares of Krispy Kreme (DNUT) and GoPro (GPRO) jumped 27% and 60%, respectively, in early trading, while Kohl's and Opendoor slumped. The return of meme stocks may have something to do with the stock market’s recent success. Stocks hit a series of record highs in recent weeks as Wall Street cheered tax cuts and pro-crypto legislation, and looked forward to trade deals. The Magnificent Seven rode AI excitement to trade near record highs, with Nvidia (NVDA) becoming the first company to ever reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. Speculative assets like cryptocurrencies have performed particularly well in recent months. Bitcoin traded at $120,000 on Tuesday afternoon, not far from its all-time high of about $123,000. Ethereum has rallied nearly 60% in the last month. Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) skyrocketed about 750% in the two weeks after its IPO in early June. There have been signs for some time that retail investors were losing interest in the Magnificent Seven after their run-up that started in late 2022. Mom-and-pop investors looking for big gains pivoted into riskier corners of the market, like small caps and more obscure AI plays, in the second quarter, according to data from Vanda Research. That trend accelerated in July, with high-beta equities like Joby (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), BigBear.ai (BBAI) among the most bought stocks by retail investors this month. Flurries of speculative activity like that seen Tuesday are sometimes interpreted as signs of market frothiness, and thus precursors to pullbacks. Though that's not always the case, and even with stocks at record highs, investors have yet to pile into equities at alarming rates. Deutsche Bank's measure of equity positioning only rose from "neutral" to "overweight" last week. "In the absence of a clear negative catalyst, there is room for positioning to continue trending higher," according to strategist Parag Thatte. Update—July 23, 2025: This story has been updated with additional share prices after markets opened on Wednesday.
