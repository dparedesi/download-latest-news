Sarah Burris is a long-time veteran of political campaigns, having worked as a fundraiser and media director across the United States. She transitioned into reporting while working for Rock the Vote, Future Majority and Wiretap Magazine, covering the Millennial Generation's perspective during the presidential elections. As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com. Women in Media Center The Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since April this week, numbers show. Market Watch attributed the flop to the tech industry and the government shutdown. Yahoo Finance cited "seesaw stretches for 'Magnificent Seven' stalwarts Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 and the Dow also closed out the bumpy week in the red as persistent worries about an AI bubble and Big Tech valuations run high." MSNBC VP of editorial and bookings, Jesse Rodriguez, wrote on X, "US stock indexes are on track for their worst five-day start to November since 2008." "The Warren Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP), the Shiller CAPE ratio (stock prices to earnings), and my Dr. X bubble detector are at record highs. WHEN WILL THE BUBBLE BURST?" asked Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "You can get people to believe a lot of things, but I guarantee you can't get them to believe grocery prices are down," said chief economist Tim Duy at SGH Macro Advisors, referring to President Donald Trump's argument that prices for everything are better. Stock associate Mike Bostic flagged concerns over the labor market, shutdown and AI bubble as the possible cause. "Ping! Is that the bubble bursting?! Bad day for American AI and tech stocks today..." said academic researcher Dr. Ian McCormick. He later added, "The selloff seems to be driven by anxiety over the ongoing US government shutdown, the resulting dearth of economic data, and warnings that an AI bubble might burst soon." In the background, "Elon will be a trillionaire. Wild," said Certified Financial Education Instructor Kalu Aja. "Thanks, Donald!" blamed media executive John Goodman.

Title: Elon Musk says 'TeraFab' chip fab may be the only answer to Tesla's colossal AI semiconductor demand — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warns against 'extremely hard' challenge

A new approach to chipmaking? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk is thinking about outsourcing some of Tesla’s chip production to Intel Foundry and even establishing the company’s own chip production operation, he said at the company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting event. Musk is perhaps the first executive of a big company to consider building an entire semiconductor production facility due to the extreme complexities and costs associated with such a project. Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, already reacted to Musk’s musings, noting that the head of Tesla may be underestimating the challenge. “I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab,” Musk said. “It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger.” TSMC calls its fab complexes with production capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month ‘Megafabs’, whereas fab complexes with production capacities of over 100,000 WSPM are referred to as ‘Gigafabs.’ A ‘Terafab’ would mean capacity way beyond 100,000 WSPM, which would transform Tesla into one of the industry’s biggest chipmakers. To put the capacity into context: TSMC’s Fab 21 complex in Arizona — which will cost the foundry $165 billion in total — is expected to become a Gigafab with six fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. Apparently, Musk is eyeing something bigger. But let us decode the whole story first, as it takes more than money to become a chipmaker these days. “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard,” Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said at a TSMC event on Thursday. “It is not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science, and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard.” 3/5 Jensen on Elon Musk’s chip fab plan: “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard. It’s not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard. $NVDA $TSLA $TSMNovember 7, 2025 As a major carmaker that also owns some of the industry's largest AI supercomputers, Tesla needs a steady supply of high-performance processors to power its artificial intelligence efforts. The company already uses tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, and now that its Dojo project has been cancelled, it plans to use its AI5 processors for cars and robots in its data centers as well. To get plenty of these processors, Tesla plans to double-source them from TSMC and Samsung. Musk also mentioned tapping Intel for chip production, though this might be a bit challenging as the company does not have any automotive-grade process technologies. “One of the things I am trying to figure out is how do we make enough chips,” Musk asked rhetorically during his keynote speech at the Tesla event. “So, I have a lot of respect for the Tesla partners, TSMC and Samsung, you know, maybe we will do something with Intel. We have not signed any deal, but it is probably worth having discussions with Intel.” However, he believes that his company will need more AI processors in the long term, which will necessitate building its own chipmaking operations, essentially becoming an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a role that even established chip designers like AMD, Fujitsu, IBM, and Panasonic gave up in recent decades. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “Even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it is still not enough,” Musk told the audience. “So, I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab. It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger. I cannot see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we are looking for, so I think we are probably going to have to build a gigantic chip fab. It’s gotta be done.” It costs leading-edge chipmakers billions of dollars to develop a fabrication process and tens of billions to build a single fab with a 20,000 WSPM capacity capable of making chips on a state-of-the-art process technology. Rapidus — Japan’s first new chipmaker with plans to build chips on advanced nodes in decades — estimates that it needs around ¥5 trillion (about $32 billion) in total investment to develop a process technology and build a fab capable of commercial production of 2 nm-class chips in 2027. While we can only applaud this ambitious project, it remains to be seen whether becoming a leading chipmaker from scratch is possible in the 2020s and with leading-edge nodes. Developing a new process technology from scratch is a particularly complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that takes 5 or more years these days, from inception to yield ramp. A development cycle of a fabrication technology begins with pathfinding, materials research, transistor structure development, and then running countless TCAD simulations to model doping, strain, and leakage for a new transistor. Rapidus has licensed its 2nm GAA transistor structure from IBM, but it is also possible to license a chunk of similar technologies from imec and CEA-Leti, public-private R&D institutes. But while it is hard to overestimate the importance of the right transistor structure, this is only the start. Once transistor technology is complete, engineers build thousands of tightly coupled process steps organized into FEOL, MOL, and BEOL modules — covering transistor formation, interconnects, and metallization. Each of these steps demands atomic-level precision in deposition, etch, lithography, and anneal. Tuning those steps (each with hundreds, if not thousands, of parameters) for manufacturability, uniformity, reliability, defectivity, power, and performance requires decades of engineering experience and time from the team. At this point, technology providers like IBM, Imec, or CEA-Leti cannot really help. Once each deposition, etch, implant, lithography, and anneal step is stable in isolation, engineers start combining modules (e.g., transistor gate stack and source/drain) on test wafers and tune their sequencing and temperature budgets to prevent cross-contamination or material degradation. This is essentially when the ordered stack of hundreds of steps that define the node — the process flow — takes shape. Again, these integration recipes are not available for licensing from R&D companies or institutes. After device performance, power, and yield meet targets, the process must be made design-usable by generating PDKs, SPICE models, verified standard-cell libraries for EDA tools, and IPs for chip designers. At the same time, engineers begin implementing the fabrication process in actual fabs and production lines. That implementation and setting the right parameters for equipment is another challenge that demands experience, not something money can buy.

Title: Disaster Ensues After AI Behemoth Floats Idea Of Stealing Your Tax Dollars If They Fail
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/06/openai-wall-street-journal-article-too-big-to-fail-bailout-china-tech-race/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T21:39:00Z

AI behemoth OpenAI tried to lay the groundwork for a taxpayer-funded bailout Wednesday and was met with swift condemnation. The Wall Street Journal published a story Sunday suggesting that OpenAI has now become “too big to fail.” In other words, if the company were to go under, it would be such a blow to the U.S. economy that the government would have to intervene and save it; otherwise, there might be a spiraling drain effect that sucks down the entire system. A domino effect from hell. OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, seemed to test-pilot the idea at a Wall Street Journal conference Wednesday, saying that the company wants to build up an ecosystem of banks, private equity groups, and a federal government “backstop” or “guarantee” to help build and finance the crucial data centers. (RELATED: Battle Against Data Centers Driving Up Electric Bills Unites Republicans, Democrats) There was swift backlash on social media, however, which forced OpenAI to do some cleanup. Friar later clarified her comment, saying that the mention of a “backdrop” muddied her point that “American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.” OpenAI wants federal taxpayer backstop for new investments, per Bloomberg. CFO has clarified this was a “misspeak.” — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) November 6, 2025 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a long statement Thursday on X, claiming they are not looking for “government guarantees,” or a handout from Uncle Sam. I would like to clarify a few things. First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or… — Sam Altman (@sama) November 6, 2025 “First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work,” he said. Sam just wrote a 1,500-word essay explaining why he absolutely doesn’t want government guarantees… while outlining a $1.4 trillion moonshot that somehow needs them in spirit, if not on paper. It’s performance art at this point. 😂 He’s basically saying: “We don’t want… — Void Freud (@voidfreud) November 6, 2025 Altman went on to say that OpenAI has discussed government-subsidized loans to help build semiconductor factories in the U.S. “The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply),” Altman said. “The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts,” he goes on. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks joined the mop-up, as well. (Sacks is essentially Silicon Valley’s lobbying voice in the Trump White House.) There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025 But, if there were a real market meltdown soon, why should we take these people’s statements that they don’t want a guaranteed federal bailout as true at face value? Clearly, they have been mulling over the idea. And it would be much easier to finance a mass buildout of data centers if investors knew that the federal government and taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill. In other words, if they knew the risk and downside of the whole AI bubble blowing up in their faces was passed on to the public. Altman recently got snappy when Brad Gerstner, an American investor, dared to ask him how OpenAI is going to pay for $1.4 trillion of long-term spending commitments on hardware and data center infrastructure from 2025-2035, even though the company’s revenue still is middling. “First of all. We’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough. I think there’s a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell your shares or anybody else’s to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman claimed. Of course, the “people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this” just seem to be those with common sense, an ability to do basic math, and a growing skepticism that AI technology will actually be worth the investment. One MIT study found that 95% of organizations that have tried to implement generative AI, like OpenAI’s technology, ChatGPT, got zero in return. Another study from the Rand Corporation revealed that 80% of AI implementations fail. All of it is beginning to reek of … ‘Just give me more money, and this time, there will be a major breakthrough, and it will all be worth it. The best is yet to come!’ I don’t know exactly how many times Altman and other tech CEOs have said something to this effect over the years, but I know it’s more than once. And something of note: the famous investor who shorted the U.S. housing market ahead of the 08/09 financial crisis, Michael Burry, now has a short position on tech behemoths Palantir and Nvidia. He’s betting that these stocks are overvalued and will soon crash. 🚨 BREAKING: Michael Burry goes short on $PLTR and $NVDA in his latest 13F filing Scion Capital just bought put options on 1M Nvidia shares and 5M Palantir shares 👀 The Big Short is feeling bearish on AI pic.twitter.com/Kn6EcINm20 — Michael Burry Stock Tracker ♟ (@burrytracker) November 3, 2025 News of the trade sparked a big selloff in tech, as speculation that AI is a bubble ready to burst is running rampant.

Title: OpenAI’s Government Lifeline: A $1T Ask Amid Wall Street’s AI Doubts

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI has reportedly requested U.S. government loan guarantees to support what could become one of the largest private infrastructure buildouts in history, an AI expansion valued at more than $ 1 trillion. The plan also aligns with OpenAI’s broader effort to reduce its dependence on Nvidia’s costly GPU ecosystem, as it explores alternative financing and chip-sourcing strategies to sustain its trillion-dollar expansion into large-scale AI infrastructure. The timing is notable. While OpenAI seeks federal backing, segments of Wall Street are growing cautious about the sustainability of the AI rally. Hedge fund manager Michael Burry has reportedly taken substantial put positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting on a correction in overextended AI equities. Meanwhile, banks such as Deutsche Bank are exploring hedges against their data-center exposure, anticipating a possible cooling period in AI infrastructure spending. It marks a clear divergence between Silicon Valley’s aggressive capital expansion and Wall Street’s tightening risk appetite—a contrast that could define the next phase of the AI investment cycle. Since its launch, OpenAI has attracted substantial private and corporate investment, led by its deep partnership with Microsoft. That backing has helped fuel its rapid expansion in both research and cloud-based AI services. Now, however, the company’s ambitions extend beyond traditional venture and corporate funding. OpenAI is pursuing federal loan guarantees, effectively positioning its AI infrastructure strategy as a public-private partnership. The move would shift part of the financial burden and risk of scaling artificial intelligence from private investors to the U.S. government, marking a significant evolution in how frontier technology projects are financed. At a recent conference, CFO Sarah Friar said the company is building “an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” participants. In a typical scenario, technology companies raise debt through private markets, paying interest rates that reflect their credit risk. OpenAI’s proposal departs from that model. By seeking a federal loan guarantee, the company would transfer much of the default risk from lenders to the U.S. government. This backing would allow OpenAI to borrow at significantly lower rates and negotiate higher loan-to-value terms, reducing the overall cost of capital for its ambitious infrastructure plans. According to OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, government participation could “materially lower the cost of financing” while broadening the base of lenders willing to fund the project. For policymakers and taxpayers, the optics are complicated. A private technology firm seeking state-backed financing to build infrastructure that could accelerate automation (and potentially displace jobs) poses a political and ethical dilemma. Analysts have compared OpenAI’s proposal to historical frameworks, such as the Defense Production Act and Department of Energy loan programs, which supported the early electric vehicle and solar sectors. The difference this time lies in the asset class: AI infrastructure, not physical manufacturing. If the plan proceeds, the financial risk would be borne by the public, rather than the venture capital community that traditionally funds frontier technology. By tying its AI build-out to federal support, OpenAI is effectively redefining the boundary between public and private investment in computing infrastructure, hinting at a state–Silicon Valley hybrid model for the next era of technological expansion. In recent filings and market moves, the relentless AI bull run is starting to show visible signs of losing steam. Two very different actors are showing varying degrees of scepticism about the AI boom’s outlook: one a famed contrarian investor, and the other a multinational bank with significant exposure to the hardware boom. According to Scion Asset Management’s Q3 2025 13F filing, hedge fund manager Michael Burry has taken substantial put option positions against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), with a combined notional value of roughly $1.1 billion. These bearish bets account for approximately 80% of Scion’s disclosed U.S. equity portfolio, indicating a strong conviction that the current AI rally may have extended beyond its fundamentals. Burry’s positioning suggests he expects a significant correction in both AI hardware and software valuations, a contrarian view amid the sector’s explosive growth. However, it’s worth noting that 13F filings don’t include cash or foreign holdings, meaning Scion could be holding sizable reserves outside of its reported U.S. equity positions. Still, Burry’s track record invites caution in interpretation. His legendary short against the U.S. housing market in 2008 proved highly profitable but was long-dated and capital-intensive, requiring substantial collateral to maintain open positions. More recently, in 2023, Burry expressed a bearish outlook on social media platform X just before a major market rebound, a call he quietly deleted afterward. The takeaway? Undoubtedly, there is a risk that the AI bubble could pop. However, timing it correctly is the risky part; the market may well run a lot higher before a meaningful downturn. On a different front, Deutsche Bank is quietly rebalancing its exposure. The bank is reportedly exploring hedges and short baskets targeting AI-linked stocks and data center debt, as it evaluates its exposure to multibillion-dollar financing for compute infrastructure. With lenders themselves beginning to hedge their bets, the frenzy that only recently dominated AI investment may be beginning to morph into something more measured and cautious. OpenAI’s request for government-backed loan guarantees raises questions that go far beyond corporate finance. If Washington agrees to underwrite even a portion of a $1 trillion AI infrastructure plan, it would mark a defining shift for the industry, the point at which advanced computing transitions from a private enterprise to a state-subsidized utility. Economists warn that data centers and GPUs depreciate significantly faster than traditional infrastructure, creating a mismatch between the short lifespan of these assets and the long-term liabilities that taxpayers may be asked to support. Supporters counter that such a partnership could represent a digital-era form of industrial policy, ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and artificial general intelligence before global competitors, particularly China and emerging state-backed players in the Middle East, can scale comparable systems. The push reflects not just the scale of infrastructure but also a shift in how AI is delivered, from strictly enterprise systems to increasingly personalized, user-facing models that are being tailored for everyday interaction, featuring modular personalities and adult-mode customization. Critics, however, see a familiar pattern emerging: socialized risk and privatized rewards. Either way, the proposal forces a deeper question for the decade ahead — can the AI revolution sustain itself on private capital alone, or has it already grown too big to fail?

Title: Here's How Hot Quantum Stocks Have Been Lately—And What to Know About Them

Move over, AI. Quantum computing stocks—those representing a technology that teases vast computing power—have soared in the past year, making even the artificial-intelligence rally look tame. Shares of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) have soared 2,700% and 3,100%, respectively, over that period. Quantum Computing (QUBT) is up 1,100%. IonQ (IONQ), up 250%, is the laggard of the bunch. Only a few of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks have posted comparable gains in the past 12 months. Software companies Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), lauded for their AI-driven growth, have risen roughly 300% in the past year. Nvidia (NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, has gained about 44%. Rallies typically slow with age, so it's understandable that the fresher theme has more momentum behind it—particularly at a time when investors have been willing to lean into speculative concepts and companies. But compare quantum stocks over the past year and AI stocks in the year after ChatGPT was released, and quantum still dramatically outpaces AI: Nvidia shares rose 206% in the 12 months starting Nov. 30, 2022, while server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) soared 212%. Everyday investors often fear they're missing out when they see asset prices skyrocketing the way quantum computing stocks have. That fear can drive investors to make risky bets on poorly understood stocks that they panic sell at a loss when the rally hits a rough patch. Granted, Wall Street didn’t immediately grasp how significant ChatGPT would be for Nvidia, and the chipmaker’s stock gains accelerated in 2023. But even in the yearlong period that Nvidia rose the fastest—between March 2023 and March 2024—its approximately 300% return still pales in comparison to most quantum stocks in the last 12 months. A string of technological breakthroughs and Big Tech investments has raised quantum computing’s visibility on Wall Street over the past year. Last December, Google (GOOG) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that it claims can solve a problem in 5 minutes that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years to complete. (That’s 714 trillion times the estimated age of the universe.) Microsoft (MSFT) debuted its own quantum chip in February, and Nvidia last month unveiled hardware designed specifically to connect quantum computers and the accelerated computing chips that power AI. As with the early days of the AI rally, quantum investors are betting the nascent technology will have profound implications for the economy and business. Quantum computing is expected to drive advancements in drug discovery, advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, financial modeling, and logistics, to name just a few of its possible commercial applications. Due to the speculative nature of quantum investments, the stocks swing dramatically on the slightest shift in sentiment. Shares of Rigetti plummeted 45% one day in January when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he believed a “very useful” quantum computer was still about 20 years out. Quantum stocks, despite their recent run-up, are relatively small compared with AI darlings. The four aforementioned companies have market capitalizations ranging from $2.5 billion (D-Wave Quantum) to $18.5 billion (IonQ)—valuations that are by no means small, but which are dwarfed by Nvidia's $5 trillion market cap. Another factor driving the stocks higher in recent months: the Trump administration's hands-on approach to public-private partnerships. The Wall Street Journal recently reported the White House was in talks to invest in several quantum computing companies. The Trump administration, which has struck similar deals with chipmaker Intel (INTC) and rare earths miners, denied the reports, but that didn't stop quantum stocks from soaring. Huang’s 20-year quantum timeline may be one of the most pessimistic forecasts out there, but the technology does face hurdles to commercialization. Quantum computers are too error-prone to achieve “quantum advantage"—the point at which a quantum computer can solve a real-world problem faster than a classical computer—according to a recent Bank of America report. Last month, IonQ announced it had achieved fidelity—a measure of computational accuracy—of 99.99%, a record for quantum computers that essentially means the computer would make one mistake for every 10,000 computations. But the binary computers we use today boast much higher fidelity, making a mistake in one out of every 10 quintillion computations, according to BofA. To achieve “quantum advantage,” BofA estimates quantum will need to reach fidelity of 99.9999%. And it may be difficult to integrate quantum computers with existing digital infrastructure like data centers and software, according to BofA. Nonetheless, consulting firm McKinsey estimates the quantum computing market could reach $97 billion by 2035, and nearly $200 billion by 2040. And monetization by leading technology companies may not be that far off: Bank of America analysts in a note last month said they expect quantum computing to have a material impact on computing pioneer IBM’s (IBM) results by 2030.

Title: DayTrading.com's Head Analyst Issues Warning That US Stock Market Is Priced For Impossible Perfection

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.
