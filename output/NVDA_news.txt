According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility. Among the most popular ETFs offered on the platform are VUAA and SXR8 (S&P 500), the domestic AETF.GR, as well as thematic ETFs linked to oil, bonds and volatility. Greeks are strengthening their investment profile by making an investment shift to foreign stocks with an emphasis on ETFs and technology, choosing stocks such as Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and Google that are among their main international choices. In the domestic market, they prefer Metlen, OPAP, National Bank, Jumbo, Piraeus, Motor Oil, Alpha Bank and PPC. However, data shows that participation in the domestic market remains limited, with only 30 million euros directed to Greek products out of a total turnover of 682 million euros of the platform, a fact that confirms the international orientation of the average Greek investor of Freedom24, who is on average 35 years old, active in investments, with a systematic monthly presence, steadily building his portfolios with a long-term perspective and not occasionally. As emphasized by George Karageorgos, Head of Representative Office in Greece, “our goal is to strengthen the investment culture in Greece. We warmly thank the 100,000 Greek investors for their trust. This is a milestone that confirms the dynamic development of the company in our country and the trust of Greek investors in modern, transparent and easy-to-use digital investment solutions. We are committed to continuing to innovate, offer reliable solutions and support investment progress in Greece.” The Freedom24 office in Greece began operations in 2021 and has grown from 3 to 16 people in the last two years. In 2024, the company recorded a 71.6% increase in its client base compared to the previous financial year, and its client funds reached 330 million euros. It is the first international investment platform with ATHEX membership, with healthy client growth and fully coordinated with the preferences of Greek investors. The Greek office’s plans include connecting as a representative with the parent company in Cyprus, with the aim of expanding its investment portfolio. At the same time, it plans to offer fund transfer and card linking services to portfolios. Freedom24 is the European subsidiary of Freedom Holding Corp., a NASDAQ-listed international investment group with operations in the US, Europe and Central Asia. The group serves 555,000 clients worldwide and has a market capitalization of 9 billion dollars. As a European-based retail broker, Freedom24 offers access to over 40,000 stocks, 1,500 ETFs and 800,000 options on US stocks on the largest exchanges in the US, Europe and Asia. The platform has been awarded with awards such as “Best Multi-product Broker” in Italy and “Best ETF Broker” in Portugal, while it has also received the gold medal “Champion of Service” in Germany for two consecutive years.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo and rising stock graph are seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK :Traders in the options markets are bracing for industry-wide volatility when AI-chipmaker Nvidia reports results on Wednesday, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy trading. For VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the largest semiconductors ETF with some $22 billion in assets, about 2.4 put options changed hands daily over the last 10 days against every call option traded, the most defensive the trading has been in about 10 months, according to Trade Alert data. Call options convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future while put contracts offer the right to sell the shares at a given price. "The put buying in SMH ahead of Nvidia's earnings reflects growing concern about potential volatility for the entire sector following the report," said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.

Title: 'Full hit from China': Analysts are staying bullish on Nvidia ahead of earnings, but tariffs loom large

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: Piper Sandler Warns Of The “Last Wave Of Negative News” Ahead Of NVIDIA’s Pivotal Q1’25 Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares have been firmly pegged on a dizzying roller-coaster ever since DeepSeek released its R1 model back in January, having contended with peak AI fears, a full-fledged global war and the ensuing rapid de-escalation, and the fallout from the ongoing decoupling between the US and China. Yet, NVIDIA seems to have emerged from these Sisyphean obstructions relatively unscathed, and is on the cusp of clearing its last remaining negative catalysts for the year, as per a new investment note from Piper Sandler. To wit, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has reiterated an 'Overweight' rating and $150 share price target for NVIDIA, while noting: "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week. We think that April quarter is poised for a miss in revenues largely from macro uncertainty and from the H20 ban." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the Trump administration recently imposed licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPUs, which is expected to translate to a $5.5 billion inventory-related charge in Q1. As per an estimation by Susquehanna analysts, these licensing requirements cost NVIDIA $1 billion in China-related sales over the last three weeks of the company's April-ending quarter. For the rest of the year, these lost sales are likely to amount to $3.5 billion per quarter. What's more, the H20-related write-downs might depress NVIDIA's margins by 11 percentage points to 67.7 percent in Q1, as per an analysis by Wedbush. Last week, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang declared that his company had walked away from $15 billion in potential annual sales in China following the imposition of licensing requirements. Concurrently, Huang predicted that the market for AI GPUs in China would swell to $50 billion in 2026. Of course, NVIDIA has been working on a China-specific, watered-down version of its Blackwell GPUs to comply with existing US export controls. However, given Washington's mercurial temperament towards all things China-related, the world's second-largest economy remains a persistent point of concern for NVIDIA. Coming back, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar believes NVIDIA's new China-specific Blackwell GPU will only launch in the latter half of its July-ending quarter. Kumar also believes that the factors responsible for NVIDIA's underperformance in Q1 are largely "outside" its control. The analyst goes on to note: "Despite this, we see a strong back half of the year given HPC capex coming on strong coupled with macro forces improving driven by sovereign investments following the announcements of several large deals over recent weeks." Kumar ends his note with solid advice: "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." Of course, while Piper Sandler appears cautious heading into NVIDIA's Q1 earnings print on Wednesday, Lynx Equity is anything but, boldly declaring that the stock could break out to new highs. "After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations." Lynx Equity also took pains to note the resurgence of CoWoS capacity build at TSMC, which strongly suggests recovery in NVIDIA's supply chain. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Trump's relationship with Apple in souring

The president floated a 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the U.S. on Friday, adding that Apple (AAPL-0.39%) would foot the bill. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,” President Trump said in a TruthSocial post on Friday morning. Shares in Apple were down almost 4% by market open. The threat followed a report by the Financial Times that Foxconn (HNHPF-1.69%), Apple’s supplier, would spend $1.5 billion on a plant in India for iPhones. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during business roundtable in Qatar last week. I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Cook was absent from the president’s Middle East tour, which was attended by Big Tech’s leaders. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Trump said to Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The spat over Apple’s plans for Indian manufacturing marks a shift in Trump and Cook’s relationship, as the pair have historically been close allies. The president mistakenly called the CEO “Tim Apple” in 2019. That same year, the president told reporters that Cook is a “great executive because he calls me and others don’t.” Cook even donated $1 million of his personal money to Trump’s inauguration. On top of that, Apple committed to spend more than half a trillion dollars in the U.S over the next four years, with a focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, winning an exemption from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs. That exemption has since been made temporary, however. The possible 25% tariff comes at a bad time for Apple. It’s is the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, dropping 22%.

Title: The luxury housing market is cracking — and tech-heavy cities are getting hit hardest

Luxury home sales fell 10% in April from a year earlier, according to new data from Redfin (RDFN+0.64%). While prices remain near record highs — with the median sale hitting $1.35 million, up nearly 7% since 2024 — beneath the surface, demand is cracking. The 10% drop in sales makes for the steepest decline since 2023 and the lowest April level in over a decade. Rising prices and rates on jumbo mortgages stubbornly stuck near five-year highs help to explain the sales decline. But this isn’t just a housing story. It’s a broader signal. For years, wealthy Americans bought the dip and shrugged off volatility. Now, they’re blinking. Evidence from the housing market and beyond suggests that the top 5% of U.S. households are growing skittish. Consider the location of the steepest declines — San Francisco, an extraordinarily tech-heavy market, but with its own finance-sector presence, too. Since 2022, nearly 500,000 tech workers have been laid off as major tech companies and smaller players have quietly offshored high-paying roles, from engineers to product managers. Even Walmart (WMT+0.77%) is trimming corporate headcount — not out of desperation, but arguably because it can. The Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.90%) recently captured the new mood in boardrooms: “Everybody’s replaceable.” Such attitudes are likely to particularly affect white-collar workers in the wealthiest 5% who rely on their corporate salaries for the bulk of their income. In short, if such workers are anxious, they’re right to be. So they’re not buying mansions or rushing to close — they’re wondering if the floor beneath them is as solid as it felt a year or two ago. It’s a quiet kind of panic: the pullback of those who still have money, but no longer feel safe. The result is weakening demand in what should be the most interest-rate-immune and resilient segment of the market. There’s other evidence to suggest that the wealthy are parking capital, not deploying it. Numerous news reports, ahead of Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) earnings expected Wednesday, are pointing out that some $7 trillion is sitting in money-market funds. While not all this cash reflects U.S. upper-middle-class wealth, a portion of it certainly does, suggesting affluent Americans may currently see more risk than reward in assets such as stocks and housing. At the other end of the market, would-be buyers are priced out by 7% mortgage rates and $400,000 median homes, an affordability crisis devouring some 43% of median household income. When the housing market locks up at both ends, cost alone can’t explain the crisis. You have to look to confidence, and how that has gone missing.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Reuters (TRI+0.10%), citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company is preparing to release a stripped-down version of its popular Blackwell AI chips that have been specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules. The news comes days before Nvidia prepares to release its first-quarter 2025 earnings. The Blackwell-based, China-only chip will reportedly cost from $6,000 to $8,000 and use conventional GDDR7 memory, a step down from the high-bandwidth tech in Nvidia’s flagship models. The previous H20 chips offered in the country sold for between $10,000 and $12,000. This coming chip also would ditch packaging in technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.63%) An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the company is looking at its “limited” options: “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.” This isn’t Nvidia’s first regulatory rodeo. After the U.S. blocked chip exports to China in 2022, the company responded with watered-down versions. When those got swept up in restrictions in late 2023, Nvidia developed chips with further reduced performance to comply with regulations. And that regulatory merry-go-round has continued. In April, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China. Now, Nvidia is hoping that this China-specific chip variant will thread the needle. CEO Jensen Huang has been increasingly vocal about his frustrations with U.S. policy. At an event earlier this month, he called the export controls “a failure,” saying they’ve only accelerated China’s push to develop domestic AI hardware — sidelining U.S. players in the process. Tech has become the next battleground in the trade war between the U.S. and China. As a result of Nvidia’s export restrictions, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is gaining ground with its AI chips, which are quickly becoming the preferred alternative for Chinese tech firms. Nvidia’s market share in China has reportedly fallen from 90% to around 50% since 2022. But China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. And this new chip is expected to help the company keep pace overseas despite its market share loss — because as good as Huawei is becoming, Nvidia is still considered better.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock A Buy Ahead Of Earnings?

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand as Nvidia remains at the forefront of ... More next-gen computing. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stands at a pivotal moment as it prepares to release its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on May 28, 2025. The semiconductor giant has transformed from a gaming graphics company into the backbone of AI infrastructure worldwide. However, recent stock performance and mounting geopolitical challenges have investors questioning whether Nvidia remains a compelling investment opportunity. This analysis examines Nvidia's year-to-date performance, key earnings metrics, macroeconomic headwinds and expert sentiment. With Wall Street projecting record revenue of $43.3 billion alongside a significant $5.5 billion writeoff related to China restrictions, the earnings report promises to be closely watched. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering their position before results are unveiled. Nvidia's 2025 journey has been marked by volatility, with shares trading approximately 5% lower year-to-date as of late May. The year began with turbulence when Chinese startup DeepSeek released a cost-effective AI model that challenged Big Tech's AI infrastructure spending assumptions. This development and signals from Microsoft regarding potential slowdowns in AI data center investments created uncertainty about Nvidia's growth sustainability. Geopolitical tensions have further complicated the stock performance under the Trump administration. Trade restrictions resulted in export bans on Nvidia's specialized chips to China, with CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging these policies cost the company approximately $15 billion in sales. The subsequent $5.5 billion write-off of H20 inventory designed for the Chinese market represents a tangible impact on Nvidia's financials. Despite challenges, Nvidia maintains exceptional financial strength, with $38.5 billion in cash versus $8.5 billion in debt. Recent developments, including expansion into Saudi Arabia and the UAE and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeal of certain chip trade restrictions, have provided positive momentum. Options traders are pricing in potential movements of up to 7.4% following earnings, reflecting continued volatility expectations. Nvidia's earnings will be scrutinized across multiple dimensions, with investors seeking insights into near-term performance and long-term positioning. The company has historically beaten quarterly guidance while providing forward estimates exceeding consensus. However, these "beat-and-raise" scenarios have become less dramatic as Wall Street caught up with Nvidia's trajectory. The earnings call will be crucial for understanding how to navigate geopolitical challenges while capitalizing on AI demand. Supply constraints remain the primary U.S. growth limitation, while international expansion strategies are critical for offsetting substantial China revenue loss. CEO Jensen Huang's commentary on competitive positioning and customer diversification will provide vital future insights. Wall Street projects record quarterly revenue of $43.3 billion for Q1 fiscal 2026, representing 66% growth versus $26 billion last year. While impressive, this means decelerating from the prior year's 262% revenue growth. Earnings per share are expected at $0.73, up from $0.61 year-over-year, with some analysts projecting adjusted EPS of $0.88, a 44% increase. These projections must consider the $5.5 billion H20 inventory write-off impacting reported results despite underlying business strength. Historical data shows that Nvidia shareholders who purchased before earnings and held for 12 months achieved median returns of 120% over the past decade. However, as always, given evolving competitive and regulatory landscapes, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Data center revenue represents Nvidia's crown jewel, growing from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $115 billion in fiscal 2025. This segment exited recent quarters with $35.6 billion revenue and $142 billion annualized run rate. Morningstar models $40 billion for April 2025, but reduced July estimates from $44 billion to $37.6 billion due to China restrictions. Supply constraints continue limiting Nvidia's demand fulfillment ability. Analysts expect incremental quarterly growth of approximately $4 billion through fiscal 2026, driven by additional supply and continued AI adoption. Growth sustainability depends on broader AI infrastructure investment trends and customer base diversification beyond hyperscale cloud providers. AI demand remains Nvidia's fundamental growth driver, dominating GPU provision for AI training and inference workloads. The CUDA software platform creates significant switching costs, establishing competitive advantages beyond hardware. However, recent developments, including DeepSeek's model and scaling law debates, have introduced questions about AI investment sustainability. Nvidia's unique position provides superior AI trend visibility across industries. The earnings call will reveal whether AI investment slowdown concerns are materializing or demand remains robust across customer segments and regions. Expansion beyond cloud providers into government and sovereign initiatives, particularly in the Middle East, could provide significant diversification benefits. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell architecture represents a critical future growth strategy, offering significant performance improvements over Hopper chips. Launch timing and execution face competitive pressure from semiconductor rivals and custom cloud provider chips. Early adoption, production schedules, and pricing will indicate Nvidia's ability to maintain technological leadership and premium positioning. Blackwell's strategic importance extends beyond immediate revenue, demonstrating continued innovation and commitment to evolving AI workload requirements. Supply chain execution is critical, given that historical demand exceeds supply for new generations. Success could offset China revenue headwinds while reinforcing Nvidia's preferred AI infrastructure provider position. The AI chip competitive landscape evolves rapidly, with major cloud providers investing in custom silicon while traditional semiconductor companies expand AI portfolios. Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Google's TPUs, and Microsoft/Meta design plans represent direct threats. AMD aggressively expands GPU lineups for cloud customers, while Intel develops AI accelerator products. Nvidia's competitive strategy extends beyond hardware to software, networking and services, creating comprehensive ecosystems that are difficult to replicate. However, major customers' desire to diversify suppliers and reduce single-vendor dependence represents structural challenges. Maintaining the pace of innovation while preserving switching costs through software advantages will determine sustained market position and premium valuations. U.S.-China geopolitical tensions represent the most significant macroeconomic headwind, with trade restrictions fundamentally altering Nvidia's addressable market. The Trump administration's export controls effectively blocked access to one of the world's largest AI markets. The $15 billion in lost sales represents just the beginning, as China's domestic semiconductor industry develops competitive alternatives like Huawei. Broader trade tension implications extend beyond direct restrictions to supply chain vulnerabilities and technology transfer concerns. Given Taiwan tensions, Nvidia's TSMC reliance on advanced production creates additional geopolitical risk. Middle East expansion attempts to diversify geographically, but newer markets may not offset the Chinese business scale. Reciprocal tariff threats could impact broader technology sector sentiment. Global economic conditions influence Nvidia through enterprise IT spending and AI startup venture capital impacts. Higher interest rates can reduce speculative AI investment appetite while slowing industry adoption. However, Nvidia shows remarkable economic cycle resilience, with AI infrastructure investment appearing relatively insensitive to traditional indicators. Well-capitalized customer bases provide some economic downturn insulation. Morningstar assigns Nvidia a 3-star "fairly valued" rating based on a $125 fair value estimate, suggesting the current $132-135 trading represents a slight overvaluation. The analysis acknowledges the potential for a higher fundamental value if geopolitical concerns diminish or AI demand proves more durable. The wide economic moat rating reflects confidence in competitive advantages, while the "Very High" uncertainty rating acknowledges AI market nascency and geopolitical complications. Wall Street sentiment remains generally positive despite challenges, with $43.3 billion consensus revenue projections showing continued growth confidence. However, decelerating growth rates and a focus on execution challenges suggest the "easy money" AI expansion phase may be ending. Analysts increasingly focus on navigating supply constraints, competitive pressures and geopolitical headwinds while maintaining premium pricing. Market indicators suggest continued volatility, with options pricing implying significant post-earnings movement potential. Historically strong 12-month pre-earnings buyer returns provide long-term investor comfort, but changing competitive and regulatory environments may limit historical trend applicability. Given concentrated Nvidia holdings among major index funds, institutional investor behavior will be closely watched. Bottom Line Nvidia looks like a clear buy heading into earnings, with strong fundamentals, dominant AI leadership and the potential to outperform if growth holds steady. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand, and despite its $5.5 billion China write-off, the company remains at the forefront of next-gen computing. Still, risks remain. Geopolitical pressures, export restrictions and growing competition could affect future performance. While the stock appears reasonably valued, any upside will depend on Nvidia’s ability to maintain its technological edge and weather a more complex global environment.

Title: This 1 Simple Trick Can Make CEF Management Fees Vanish
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/05/27/this-1-simple-trick-can-make-cef-management-fees-vanish/

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Wooden Blocks with the text: Fees Plenty of investors miss out on the huge yields (often north of 8%) that closed-end funds (CEFs) offer. There’s one simple reason why: They get way too hung up on management fees. We’re going to look at a few reasons why that is today—and one easy way you can make those fees disappear entirely. But first, just how high are the fees we’re talking about? Well, the average fee for all CEFs tracked by my CEF Insider service is 2.95% of assets. In contrast, the largest ETF on the planet, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has a fee of just 0.09%. So, to be sure, we are talking about a big gap here. But although CEFs’ fees are much higher, there are many reasons why we shouldn’t put too much weight on them when making buying decisions. Let’s talk about those now. SPY holds every stock in the S&P 500—in other words, the 500 large-cap companies that represent the biggest public firms in America. And while these stocks do well in good times, they can have rough runs, like we saw in April, for example. That’s why we want to make sure we’re investing in assets beyond stocks, like corporate bonds. CEFs let us do that, and they give us access to smart human managers (not to mention high dividends), too. An actual person at the helm is vital in a lot of these asset classes, and in particular corporate bonds, because deep connections are key to getting access to the best new issues. We all know deep down that diversification works. But using CEFs to do it really can take things to another level, thanks in part to their high dividends. Look at the performance of the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), in purple below, since the start of 2025 to the time of this writing. GHY is a CEF Insider holding that yields an outsized 9.8%. GHY Total Returns As you can see, GHY outran SPY (in orange) while diversifying its shareholders beyond stocks and the US, too. In addition, the bond CEF barely fell below breakeven in April, while stocks were down 15%. And bear in mind, as well, that these numbers are net of fees. Speaking of which, GHY’s fees are far higher than those of SPY (1.5% of assets compared to 0.09%) All that said, some CEFs do focus on S&P 500 companies, and still have higher fees, which brings me to my second point… GHY, as mentioned, has total expenses of 1.5%, better than the CEF average but still quite high. Compare that to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), an S&P 500–focused CEF whose fees are much less, at 0.97%. But wait, if SPXX is focused on US large caps, why are its fees around 10 times those of SPY? It’s largely because SPXX also sells call options on its holdings—or rights for investors to buy them at a fixed date and price in the future. The fund gets paid for these rights (and uses those fees to help fund its 7.7% dividend). There’s some cost and work attached to that strategy, hence the higher fees. But it’s a small price to pay to get a dividend that’s nearly six times that of SPY. Currently, all CEFs covered by CEF Insider have an average yield of 9.1%, while SPY, as mentioned, yields 1.3%. In other words, a million dollars spread across all CEFs would get you over $90,000 in annual income, or $7,572 a month, versus less than $13,000, or about $1,075 monthly, from SPY. Income Potential This is why many investors use CEFs to fund an early, or partial, retirement; if it takes $682,286 in savings to replace the average paycheck in America (as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ median weekly earnings survey) with CEFs but a staggering $4.8 million saved with SPY, you can see why CEFs could attract more attention—and thus, CEF issuers can charge higher fees. Now, here’s the kicker: CEFs have an unusual structure that means they often trade for less than their assets are actually worth. Let’s say you have a CEF that has $100,000 spread across shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), among others, and the CEF has 10,000 shares in total. Each share is worth $10. Easy enough. But CEFs are, as the name says, closed. That means CEF issuers can’t issue new shares to new investors, so all of the shares trade on the public market, like stocks, and their market prices fluctuate based on investor demand, sometimes diverging from the actual value of the underlying holdings. If that demand is higher than the actual market value of the CEF, it’ll trade at a premium to its portfolio’s net asset value, or NAV; if lower, it’ll trade at a discount. On average, CEFs trade at a 6% discount, according to CEF Insider data. So if your CEF trades at a discount wider than its annual management fee, the discount can effectively offset the cost of that fee. And bear in mind that some CEFs are steeply discounted, with discounts of 10% or more. It’s worth pointing out that the fees are taken out of the CEF’s portfolio by managers automatically as a matter of course; investors don’t have to mail off a check. Let’s wrap with a quick recap, then: CEFs give you access to discounted, high-quality assets, far higher income than most ETFs, and they give you a high-income, low-cost way to diversify, too. Plus, the best CEFs outperform their benchmarks—including the S&P 500. This is why CEFs are a passive income weapon that many wealthy investors are happy to keep in their arsenal.

Title: Markets soar after Trump walks back EU trade threats

U.S. stocks rose sharply Tuesday, with the S&P 500 climbing over 2%, the Nasdaq gaining 2.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 740 points, or 1.8%, in a rebound from last week’s selloff. Bond yields declined around the globe, including in the U.S., where the 10-year Treasury dipped below 4.5%. Gold tumbled 2%. The catalyst: President Donald Trump announced a delay in his threatened 50% tariff hike on European imports, opting instead for expedited trade talks with the E.U. The move followed a weekend call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and marks a sharp turn from Friday’s rhetoric, which had markets on edge — especially after Trump warned Apple that foreign-assembled iPhones could soon face steep levies. Consider the actual events: Trump escalated a conflict by threatening 50% tariffs on the E.U., including on Apple’s (AAPL-0.39%) foreign-assembled iPhones, essentially manufacturing a crisis. Then, after a phone call, he announced a delay on those tariffs, positioning the pause as a negotiated victory or goodwill gesture. But since he created the crisis in the first place, the “deal” or “pause” is just Trump backing off his own threat. Another weird twist in the story? In the same social media post that kicked off the weekend’s trade crisis, Trump threatened a specific 25% tariff on iPhones not assembled in the U.S. This prompted critics — including hedge fund manager Spencer Hakimian in a widely shared tweet — to point out that such policy would mean firms like Samsung, which fully produce their products abroad, would in fact face lower levies and effectively be granted a price advantage vs. actual American companies like Apple. After the tweet went viral, Trump pivoted, issuing a similar tariff warning to Samsung. Markets have been whipsawed again and again in 2025 as the White House pivoted, then pivoted again, repositioning global trade policy in posts and offhand comments. The current reprieve hinges on progress in fast-tracked talks between now and July 9, the new deadline Trump has set for potential tariff implementation. For now, though, stocks are flying — helped along by rallying bonds and the hope that this latest tariff scare will end not with a bang but a negotiation. The rest of the week promises more market-moving news. Semiconductor giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) reports after the bell tomorrow, with investors watching closely and the results likely to dominate headlines for several days. The results of the Fed’s early May meeting will also be released Wednesday. While no surprises are expected, every word is still likely to be parsed for any clues on inflation and potential rate cuts in the back half of 2025.

Title: Nvidia's $43 billion question: Can Jensen Huang keep the AI hype train on track?
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-q1-2025-earnings-stock-jensen-huang-ai-chips-1851782018
Time Published: 2025-05-27T09:00:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) has become the almost undisputed poster child of the AI boom — and now it’s time to show the receipts. The $3.3 trillion chipmaker will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2026 on Wednesday, and expectations are enormous. Analysts forecast a revenue surge to $43.26 billion, nearly 66% higher than the same quarter a year ago, with adjusted earnings per share jumping to $0.88 from $0.61, a growth of about 44%. Still, those forecasts might be selling the semiconductor giant short. The company has a habit of surpassing earnings expectations — topping earnings estimates by an average of about 7% in the last two quarters. Nvidia, whose chips have become the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, has been on a staggering run. But with stakes this high, investors are laser-focused on whether Nvidia’s latest bets — such as its next-gen Blackwell platform, deepening cloud partnerships, and response to U.S.-China chip tensions — will deliver the kind of blockbuster quarter the markets have come to expect. At the heart of Nvidia’s revenue machine is its Data Center business, which has grown into its largest and most profitable segment thanks to insatiable demand from cloud providers, AI startups, and enterprise customers building foundation models. Analysts expect this division alone to generate $21.27 billion in Q1 revenue. CEO Jensen Huang has positioned Nvidia not just as a chipmaker but as the infrastructure layer powering the AI revolution. The company is hoping that narrative continues with Blackwell, the GPU architecture introduced in March that Huang says will unlock the training and deployment of models that are orders of magnitude more powerful than current systems. The flagship GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip is already being integrated by hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN-2.87%), Google Cloud (GOOGL-1.57%), Microsoft Azure (MSFT-0.92%), and Oracle (ORCL-0.97%). Nvidia may be dominant, but it’s not operating in a vacuum. Rival chipmakers like AMD (AMD+0.47%) and Intel (INTC-1.50%) are racing to close the performance gap, while companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on custom silicon to reduce reliance on third-party GPUs. At the same time, a wave of Chinese AI chipmakers is emerging as Nvidia contends with export restrictions, creating fresh competitive pressure in one of its most important markets. But Nvidia isn’t just about GPUs anymore. As investor expectations climb, the company is quietly broadening its AI stack — moving beyond silicon into networking, software, and cloud integration in a bid to become the full-stack backbone of AI infrastructure. Nvidia is deepening its economic moat and creating more stable, recurring revenue streams that could smooth earnings volatility over time. Through partnerships with major cloud providers, Nvidia is embedding itself into the very platforms AI developers rely on. Basically: Nvidia is trying to become more than just a supplier of AI tools. The company wants to become a critical platform for AI development itself. Investors will be watching closely for clear evidence that Nvidia’s expansion beyond GPUs is starting to pay off in revenue. Wall Street wants to see whether the company’s networking products are contributing to meaningful growth within the data center segment. Margins will also be a key focus. Networking and software typically deliver higher profitability than hardware, so any signs of margin expansion would support the narrative that Nvidia is transforming into a more durable, high-margin platform business. (Which could reassure investors that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable and not just tied to cyclical chip demand.) Finally, Wall Street will listen for signs that Nvidia’s AI software stack is gaining adoption among large enterprises outside the hyperscaler ecosystem — into sectors such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing — which would highlight the long-term potential of Nvidia’s platform strategy and reinforce the company’s role as the backbone of AI development. There is, of course, a major x-factor: China. Nvidia is ground zero in the U.S.-China tech rivalry — its GPUs might just be the most valuable components in the AI arms race, and its position is increasingly shaped by policy, not just engineering. Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue, but that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs. Huang said recently that years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang has said. To defend — and expand — its foothold, Nvidia is looking to establish an R&D center in Shanghai and is reportedly preparing further downgraded chip models that comply with U.S. rules. Investors will be looking to see the impact of U.S. export controls: how much they’ve dented sales, whether downgraded chips can sustain demand in China, and more. Wall Street will also be watching for any supply chain stress; Nvidia relies heavily on TSMC (TSM+0.63%) for manufacturing, and its capacity constraints remain a gating factor. While the company remains dominant in many global markets — and is expanding into the Middle East through Saudi Arabia, in what one analyst called a “watershed moment,” and the United Arab Emirates — Wall Street will be looking for updates on how Nvidia plans to navigate what could be its most challenging international landscape in years. Nvidia is the poster child of the AI trade, and its financial performance serves as a high-frequency indicator of how far the generative AI economy has progressed from hype to hard returns. A strong beat would signal that tech giants (see: Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are continuing to pour billions into AI infrastructure, reaffirming the AI investment thesis that has largely powered the Nasdaq’s rally. Nvidia’s valuation is rich, but so are many other AI-linked names. If Nvidia meets or beats expectations, it could justify the current risk appetite for high-growth names. But a miss, even a tiny one, could trigger a sentiment reset. If forward guidance is strong, it’ll show that enterprises are starting to spend on AI beyond experiments — e.g., in areas such as software integration, inference, and LLM deployment. Nvidia’s stock has been on quite a wild ride in 2025. After hitting a high earlier in the year, shares fell amid broader market turbulence and investor anxiety about whether the AI trade had gotten overheated. President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement sent the stock into a sharp dip, but it has since rebounded. Now, this quarter’s results could be a clearing event that could reestablish momentum. One looming concern: supply chain capacity. Demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to exceed supply, and while the company has worked to scale production, it may still be leaving money on the table simply due to how long it takes to manufacture and deliver its most advanced products. Investors will also be watching closely for details on capital expenditures and supply chain resilience. Wall Street will want to see how aggressively Nvidia is investing to expand capacity, whether through additional foundry partnerships or securing more critical components. Any signs that supply constraints are easing — or worsening — could influence how sustainable current growth trajectories appear. But the big question now is whether Nvidia can not only meet but beat expectations — something it has done consistently. While Nvidia remains possibly the most important company in the world’s hottest tech sector, that also means the pressure is greater than ever.

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

Time Published: 2025-05-26T09:55:01Z
Full Content:
You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

Zvi Mowshowitz of the Don't Worry About the Vase substack did an excellent job writing up the key dynamics of the deal. I’ll be running excerpts from his post with some comments of mine interspersed. Our government, having withdrawn the new diffusion rules, has now announced an agreement to sell massive numbers of highly advanced AI chips to UAE and Saudi Arabia (KSA). This post analyzes that deal and that decision. It is possible, given sufficiently strong agreement details (which are not yet public and may not be finalized) and private unvoiced considerations, that this deal contains sufficient safeguards and justifications that, absent ability to fix other American policy failures, this decision is superior to the available alternatives. Perhaps these are good deals, with sufficiently strong security arrangements that will actually stick. Perhaps UAE and KSA are more important markets and general partners than we realize, and the rest of the world really is unable to deploy capital and electrical power the way they can and there is nothing we can do to change this, and perhaps they have other points of strategic importance, so we have to deal with them. Perhaps they are reliable American allies going forward who wouldn’t use this as leverage, for reasons I do not understand. There are potential worlds where this makes sense. The fact remains that the case being made for this deal, in public, actively makes the situation seem worse. David Sacks in particular is doubling down and extending the rhetoric I pushed back against last week, when I targeted Obvious Nonsense in AI diffusion discourse. Even within the White House, the China hawks are questioning this deal, and Sacks responded by claiming to not even understand their objections and to all but accuse such people of being traitorous decels wearing trench coats. I stand by my statements last week that even if accept the premise that all we need care about are ‘America wins the AI race’ and how we must ‘beat China,’ our government’s policies, on diffusion and elsewhere, seem determined to lose an AI race against China. The point of the diffusion rules is to keep the AI chips secure and out of Chinese hands, both in terms of physical security and use of their compute via remote access. It is possible that the agreements we are making with UAE and KSA will replace and improve upon the functionality, in those countries in particular, of the diffusion rules. It’s not about a particular set of rules. It is about the effect of those rules. Give me a better way to get the same effect, and I’m happy to take it. When I say ‘something similar’ below, I mean in the sense of sufficient safeguards against the diversion of either the physical AI chips or the compute from the AI chips. Access to those chips is what matters most. Whereas market share in selling AI chips is not something I am inclined to worry about except in my role as Nvidia shareholder. I do not consider them reliable allies going forward, and there are various reasons that even the best version of these agreements would make me deeply uncomfortable, but it is possible to reach an agreement that physically locates many data centers in the Middle East and lets them reap the financial benefits of their investments and have compute available for local use, but does not in the most meaningful senses ‘hand them’ the compute in question. As in, no I do not trust them, but we could find a way that we do not have to, if they were fully open to whatever it took to make that happen. I also would highlight the implicit claim I made here, that the pool of American advanced AI chips is essentially fixed, and that we have sufficient funding available in Big Tech to buy all of them indefinitely. If that is not true, then the UAE/KSA money matters a lot more. Then there is the similar question of whether we were going to actually run out of available electrical power with no way to get around that. A lot of the question comes down to: What would have counterfactually happened to those chips? Would we have been unable to deploy them? [Jordan: See ChinaTalk’s recent coverage of an excellent IFP report that explored what a policy agenda to rapidly increase the energy available for AI deployment would look like] Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity With that in mind, here are the central points I highlighted last week: America is ahead of China in AI. Diffusion rules serve to protect America’s technological lead where it matters. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not reliable American allies, nor are they important markets for our technology. We should not be handing them large shares of the world’s most valuable resource, compute. The exact diffusion rule is gone but something similar must take its place, to do otherwise would be how America ‘loses the AI race.’ Not having any meaningful regulations at all on AI, or ‘building machines that are smarter and more capable than humans,’ is not a good idea, nor would it mean America would ‘lose the AI race.’ AI is currently virtually unregulated as a distinct entity, so ‘repeal 10 regulations for every one you add’ is to not regulate at all building machines that are soon likely to be smarter and more capable than humans, or anything else either. ‘Winning the AI race’ is about racing to superintelligence. It is not about who gets to build the GPU. The reason to ‘win’ the ‘race’ is not market share in selling big tech solutions. It is especially not about who gets to sell others the AI chips. If we care about American dominance in global markets, including tech markets, stop talking about how what we need to do is not regulate AI, and start talking about the things that will actually help us, or at least stop doing the things that actively hurt us and could actually make us lose. Diffusion controls on AI chips we’ve enforced on China so far have had a huge impact. DeepSeek put out a highly impressive AI model, but by their own statements they were severely handicapped by lack of compute. Chinese adoption of AI is also greatly held back by lack of inference compute. China is competing in spite of this severe disadvantage. It is vital that we hold their feet to the fire on this. China has an acute chip shortage, because it physically cannot make more AI chips, so any chips it would ship to a place like UAE or KSA would each be one less chip available in China. Whenever you see arguments from David Sacks and others against AI diffusion rules, ask the question: Is an argument for a different set of export controls and a different chip regime that still protects against China getting large quantities of advanced AI chips? Or is it an argument, as it often is, that to preserve our edge in compute we should sell off our compute, that to preserve our edge in tech we should give away our edge in tech? As in, that what matters is our market share of AI chips, not who uses them? This is not a strawman, for example Ben Thompson argues exactly this very explicitly and repeatedly. Ben Thompson’s recent interview with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, made it clear both of them have this exact position. That to maintain America’s edge in AI, we need to sell our AI chips to whoever wants them, including China, because ‘China will not be held back’ as if having a lot more chips wouldn’t have helped them. And essentially saying that all Nvidia chips everywhere support the ‘American tech stack’ rather than China rather obviously turning around and using them for their own tech. He explicitly is yelling we need to ‘compete in China’ or else. Complete Obvious Nonsense talking of his own book, which one must remind oneself is indeed his job, what were you really expecting him to say? Well, what he is saying is that the way we ‘lose the AI race’ is someone builds a CUDA alternative or steals Nvidia market share. That his market is what matters. It’s full text. Not remotely a strawman. I would disagree with arguments of form #2 in the strongest possible terms. If it’s arguments of form #1, we can talk about it. We should keep these facts in mind as we analyze the fact that the United States has signed a preliminary chip deal with the UAE. There is a 5GW AUE-US AI campus planned, and is taking similar action in Saudi Arabia. The deals were negotiated by a team led by David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. Lennart Heim: To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi (UAE) into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far. In exchange for access to our chips, we get what are claimed to be strong protections against chip diversion, and promises of what I understand to be a total of $200 billion in investments by the UAE. That dollar figure is counting things like aluminum, petroleum, airplanes, Qualcomm and so on. It is unclear how much of that is new. The part of the deal that matters is that a majority of the UAE investment in data centers has to happen here in America. I notice that I am skeptical that all the huge numbers cited in the various investment ‘deals’ we keep making will end up as actual on-the-ground investments. As in: Walter Bloomberg: UAE PRESIDENT SAYS UAE TO INVEST $1.4T IN U.S OVER NEXT 10 YEARS At best there presumably is some creative accounting and political symbolism involved in such statements. Current UAE foreign-direct-investment stock in the USA is only $38 billion, their combined wealth funds only have $1.9 trillion total. We can at best treat $1.4 trillion as an aspiration, an upper bound scenario. If we get the $200 billion we should consider that a win, although if the deal is effectively ‘all your investments broadly are in the West and not in China’ then that would indeed be a substantial amount of funds. Nor is this an isolated incident. The Administration is constantly harping huge numbers, claiming to have brought in $14 trillion in new investment, including $4 trillion from the recent trip to Arabia, or roughly half of America’s GDP. Jason Furman (top economic advisor, Obama White House): That’s nuts and baseless. I doubt the press releases even add up to that. But, regardless, press releases are a terrible way to determine the investment or the impact of his policies on it. Justin Wolfers: Trump has claimed a $1.2 trillion investment deal from Qatar. Qatar’s annual GDP is a bit less than $250 billion per year. So he’s claiming an investment that would require every dollar every Qatari earned over the next five years. UAE’s MGX will also be opening Europe’s largest data center in France, together with Nvidia, an 8.5 billion Euro investment, first phase to be operational in 2028. This has been in the works for a while. Not that the numbers ultimately matter all that much. What does matter is: How will we ensure the chips don’t fall literally or functionally into Chinese hands? It comes down to the security provisions and who is going to effectively have access to and run all this compute. I don’t see here any laying out of the supposed tough security provisions. Without going into details, if the agreements on both physical and digital security are indeed implemented in a way that is sufficiently tough and robust, if we are the ones who both physically and digitally control and monitor things on a level at least as high as domestically, and can actually have confidence none of this will get diverted, then that goes a long way. We don’t yet have enough of that information to say. The public explanations for the deal, and the public statements about what safety precautions are considered necessary, do not bring comfort. I very much do not like comments like this, made in response to the Bloomberg piece above. David Sacks (US AI Czar): If the concern [about the deal] is about diversion of advanced semiconductors to China, that’s an important policy objective but one that is easily addressed with a security agreement and a “trust but verify” approach. Modern AI supercomputers are 8 feet tall and weigh two tons; these are not like diamonds smuggled in a briefcase. To verify that chips are where they’re supposed to be, an auditor can just visit the data center and count server racks. Semianalysis: As such, physical inspections are key to ensuring the GPUs are where they are supposed to be. The White House is aware of the risks and is prepared to ensure the chips are where they are supposed to be. As Bloomberg reported (quotes David Sacks’s statement above). I’m sorry, what? You can ‘just visit the data center and count server racks’? It terrifies me to see so many people arguing for the deal explicitly saying that this is a good statement, rather than a terrifying statement that we are hoping no one involved in the actual work believes to be true. [Jordan: In 2022 I did a show with Kevin Wolf, the former head of BIS, who mentioned off-hand that there were literally only two people Commerce had in China to do site inspections. Since then BIS’ budget has barely budged and faced DOGE cuts in the early days of this administration. There is not the capacity to do datacenter inspections in a serious way today.] Jordan Schneider: Let's start with the last thing first. This 60-day unverified list: is there a potential that the impact of this could actually be a lot bigger than what we currently see, if some of these big names on the unverified entity list end up graduating to full entity-list status? Kevin Wolf: It's really up to the Chinese government. If they allow access, give the information that the Commerce Department is seeking, and allow the two people in China that do inspections and site visits to do their jobs… Jordan Schneider: Whoa, wait, two? There are, like, 30 firms on there! Kevin Wolf: Yeah, I know, but no other country has any, and the Commerce Department is the only export control organization on the planet with its own enforcement agents who are subject matter experts in export controls. I think diversion via remote access is far more likely than physical diversion, and this response does not address the remote access issue at all, but even simply treating this as a physical diversion issue, o3, is the quoted statement accurate? o3 (full one shot, full response quoted, in response to literally quoting Sacks without attribution and asking ‘is this accurate?’): Short version: Mostly wrong. Chips are tiny and high-value, so diversion is hard to stop with “count the racks.” Physical audits help but they are far from sufficient. High value-to-weight ratio.At ~$30 k per H100, a single 20 kg carry-on full of GPUs is > $1 m. That’s an attractive target. Racks are heavy; the payload isn’t. Modularity.GPUs slide out in minutes. An auditor sees the enclosure; they cannot tell if the trays were swapped yesterday or will be tomorrow. Dummy blanks cost <$10. Front companies & trans-shipping.Chips often leave the compliant data-center before any inspection window. Paperwork shows them installed; reality changes after the auditor flies home. Remote lease risk.Even if the hardware stays in the U.S., Chinese entities can simply rent time on it. Export-control rules treat “deemed exports” (remote access by restricted users) as violations. Limited audit frequency & competence.Meaningful verification requires random, intrusive, technically savvy inspections plus cryptographic attestation of firmware. Counting racks is neither. My best estimate: ≤ 30 % that “security agreement + occasional rack counting” alone keeps advanced GPUs out of China for > 3 years. ≥ 70 % that significant leakage continues absent tighter controls (HW tracking, cryptographic attestation, and supply-chain tagging). So the quoted claim is misleading: rack-level audits are helpful but nowhere near “easily addresses” the diversion problem. When I asked how many chips would likely be diverted from a G42 data center if this was the security regime, o3’s 90% confidence interval was 5%-50%. Note that the G42 data center is 20% of the total compute here, so if we generously assume no physical diversion risk in the other 80%, that’s 1%-10% of all compute we deploy in the UAE. Is that acceptable? The optimal amount of chip diversion is not zero. But I think this level of diversion would be a big deal, and the bigger concern is remote access. I want to presume, for overdetermined reasons, that Sacks’s statement was written without due consideration or it does not reflect his actual views, and we would not actually make this level of dumb mistake where they could literally just swap the chips out for dummy chips. I presume we are planning to use vastly superior and more effective precautions against chip diversion and also have a plan for robust monitoring of compute use to prevent remote access diversion. But how can we trust an administration to take such issues seriously, if their AI Czar is not taking this even a little bit seriously? This is not a one time incident. Similar statements keep coming. That’s why I spent a whole post responding to them. David Sacks is also quoted extensively directly in the Bloomberg piece, and is repeatedly very dismissive of worried about diversion of chips or of compute, saying it is a fake argument and an easy problem to solve, and he talks about these as if they were reliable American allies in ways I do not believe are accurate. Sacks also continues to appear to view winning AI to be largely about selling AI chips. As in, if G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, is using American AI chips, then it essentially ‘counts as American’ for purposes of ‘winning,’ or similar. I don’t think that is how this works, or that this is a good use of a million H100s. Bloomberg reports 80% of chips headed to the UAE would go to US companies, 20% to G42. I very much want us to think about the actual physical consequences of various actions, not what those actions symbolize or look like. I do think, despite everything else, it is a very good sign that David Sacks is ‘urging people to read the fine print.’ This is moderated by the fact that we do not have the fine print, so we can’t read it. The true good news there requires one to read all that fine print, and one also should not assume that the fine print will get implemented. Nor do we yet have access to what the actual fine print says, so we cannot read it. Dylan Patel and others at Semianalysis offer a robust defense of the deal, saying clearly that ‘America wins’ and that this benefits American AI infrastructure suppliers on all levels, including AI labs and cloud providers. They focus on three benefits: money, tying KSA/UAE to our tech stack, and electrical power, and warn of the need for proper security, including model weight security, a point I appreciated them highlighting. Those seem like the right places to focus, and the right questions to ask. How much of their money is really up for grabs and how much does it matter? To what extent does this meaningfully tie UAE/KSA to America and how much does that matter? How much do we need their ability to provide electrical power? How will the security arrangements work, will they be effective, and who will effectively be in charge and have what leverage? Specifically, on their three central points: They call this macro, but a better term would be money. UAE and KSA (Saudi Arabia) can make it rain, a ‘trillion-dollar floodgate.’ This raises two questions. Question one: Was American AI ‘funding constrained’? The big tech companies were already putting in a combined hundreds of billions a year. Companies like xAI can easily raise funds to build giant data centers. If Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft wanted to invest more, are they really about to run out of available funding? Are there enough more chips available to be bought to run us out of cash? Semianalysis seems to think we should be worried about willingness of American companies to invest here and thinks we will have trouble with the financing. I am not convinced of this. Have you seen what these companies (don’t have to) pay on corporate bonds? Did we need to bring in outside investors? Should we even want to, given these investments look likely to pay off? This is a major crux. If indeed American big tech companies are funding constrained in their AI investments, then the money matters a lot more. Whereas if we were already capable of buying up all the chips, that very much cuts the other way. Question two: As we discussed earlier, is the trillion-dollar number real? We keep seeing these eye-popping headline investment numbers, but they don’t seem that anchored to reality, and seem to include all forms of investment including not AI, although of course other foreign direct investment is welcome. Do their investments in US datacenters mean anything, and are they even something we want, given that the limiting factor driving all this is either constraints on chip availability or on electrical power? Will this be crowding out other providers? If these deals are so positive for American tech companies, why didn’t the stock market moves reflect this? No, I will not accept ‘priced in.’ They call this geopolitical, that UAE and KSA are now tied to American technology stacks. As they say, ‘if Washington enforces tight security protocols.’ We will see. David Sacks is explicitly dismissing the need for tight security protocols. Classically, as Trump knows well, when the bank loans you a large enough amount and you don’t pay it back, it is the bank that has the problem. Who is being tied to whose stack? They will be able to at least cut the power any time. It is not clear from public info what other security will be present and what happens if they decide to turn on us, or use that threat as leverage. Can they take our chips and their talents elsewhere? This can almost be looked at as a deal with one corporation. G42 seems like it’s going to effectively be on the UAE side of the deal, and it is going to have a lot of chips in a lot of places. A key question is, to what extent do we have the leverage on and control over G42, and to what extent does this mean they will act as a de facto American tech company and ally? How much can we trust that our interests will continue to align? Who will be dependent on who? Will our security protocols extend to their African and European outposts? Why does buying a bunch of our chips tie them into the rest of our stack? My technical understand is that it doesn’t. They’re only tied to the extent that they agreed to be tied as part of the deal (again, details unknown), and they could swap out that part at any time. In my experience you can change which AI your program uses by changing a few lines of code, and people often do. It is not obvious why KSA and UAE using our software or tech stack is important to us other than because they are about to have all these chips. These aren’t exactly huge markets. If the argument is they have oversized effect on lots of other markets, we need to hear this case made out loud. Seminanalysis points out China doesn’t even have the capacity to sell its own AI chips yet. And I am confused about the perspectives here on ‘market share’ and the implied expectations about customer lock-in. They call this infrastructure, I’d simply call it (electrical) power. This is the clearly valuable thing we are getting. It’s rather crazy that ‘put our most strategic asset except maybe nukes into the UAE and KSA’ was chosen over ‘overrule permitting rules and build some power plants or convince one of our closer allies to do it’ but here we are. So the question here is, what are the alternatives? How acute is the shortage going to be and was there no one else capable of addressing it? Also, even if we do have to make this deal now, this is screaming from the rooftops, we need to build up more electrical power everywhere else now, so we don’t have this constraint again in the future. Semianalysis also raises the concern about model weight security, but essentially think this is solvable via funding work to develop countermeasures and use of red teaming, plus defense in depth. It’s great to see this concern raised explicitly, as it is another real worry. Yes, we could do work to mitigate it and impose good security protocols, and keep the models from running in places and ways that create this danger, but will we? I don’t know. Failure here would be catastrophic. There are also other concerns even if we successfully retain physical and digital control over the chips. The more we place AI chips and other strategic AI assets there, the more we are turning UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Qatar into major AI players, granting them leverage I believe they can and will use for various purposes. David Sacks continues to claim to not understand that others think that ‘winning AI’ is mostly not about who gets to sell chips, who uses our models and picks up market share, or about superficially ‘winning’ ‘deals.’ He not only thinks it is about market penetration, he can’t imagine an alternative. He doesn’t understand that many, including myself, this is about who has compute and who gets superintelligence, and about the need for proper security. David Sacks: I’m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed “China Hawk” can claim that President Trump’s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren’t hugely beneficial for the United States. As leading semiconductor analyst Dylan Patel observed, these deals “will noticeably shift the balance of power” in America’s favor. The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch. Sam Altman: this was an extremely smart thing for you all to do and i’m sorry naive people are giving you grief. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): One Trump administration official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that with the G42 deal, American policymakers were making a choice that could mean the most powerful A.I. training facility in 2029 would be in the United Arab Emirates, rather than the United States. [Jordan: this is a wild line to be giving to the NY Times—I thought all the China hawks already got purged!] But Trump officials worried that if the United States continued to limit the Emirates’ access to American technology, the Persian Gulf nation would try Chinese alternatives. The hawks are concerned, because the hawks largely do not think that the key question is who will get to sell chips, but rather who gets to buy them and use them. This is especially true given that both America and China are producing as many top AI chips as they can, us far more successfully, and there is more than enough demand for both of them. One must think on the margin. Given that so many China hawks are indeed on record doubting this deal, if you are perplexed by this I suggest reading their explanations. Here is one example. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): Mr. Goodrich said the United States still had the best A.I. engineers, companies and chips and should look for ways to speed up permitting and improve its energy grid to hold on to that expertise. Setting up some of the world’s largest data centers in the Middle East risks turning the Gulf States, or even China, into A.I. rivals, he said. “We’ve seen this movie before and we should not repeat it,” Mr. Goodrich said. Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the huge chip sales did “not feel consistent with an America First approach to A.I. policy or industrial policy.” “Why would we want to offshore the infrastructure that will underpin the key industrial technology of the coming years?” he asked. This does not seem like a difficult position to understand? There are of course also other reasons to oppose such deals. Here is Jordan Schneider of China Talk’s response, in which he is having absolutely none of it, explicitly rejecting that either America or China has chips to spare for this. rejecting that UAE and KSA are actual allies, not expecting us to follow through with reasonable security precautions, and saying if we wanted to do this anyway we could have held out for a better deal with more control than this, I don’t know why you would be confused how someone could have this reaction based on the publicly available information: Jordan Schneider: It’s going to cannibalize US build-out and leave the world with three independent power-centers of AI hardware where we could’ve stuck to our guns, done more power generation at home, and only had China to deal with not these wild-card countries that are not actual allies. If this really is as important as we believe, why are we letting these countries and companies we deeply distrust get access to it? The Gulf’s BATNA wasn’t Huawei chips, it was no chips. Whatever we’re trying to negotiate for, we can play harder to get. BIS can just say they can’t buy Ascends and it’s not like there’s enough capacity domestically in China to service global demand absent the TSMC loophole they charged through. Plus, we’re offering to sell them 10× the chips that Huawei could conceivably sell them anytime soon even if they use the TSMC-fabbed wafers. Where’s the art-of-the-deal energy here? Right now I only see AMD and NVDA shareholders as well as Sama benefiting from all of this. I thought we wanted to raise revenue from tariffs? Why not charge 3× the market rate and put the premium into the US Treasury, some “Make America Great Again” industrial-development fund, use it to triple BIS’ budget so they can actually enforce the security side, put them on the hook for Gaza…I don't know literally anything you care about. How about a commitment not to invest in Chinese tech firms? Do we still care about advanced logic made in America? How about we only let them buy chips fabbed in the US, fixing the demand-side problem and forcing NVDA to teach Intel how to not suck. Speaking of charging through loopholes, all of the security issues Dylan raises in his article I have, generously, 15 % confidence in USG being able to resolve/resist industry and politicians when they push back. If it’s so simple to just count the servers, why hasn’t BIS already done it / been able to fight upstream industry lobbying to update the chips-and-SME regs to stop Chinese build-outs and chip acquisition? What happens when the Trump gets a call from the King when some bureaucrat is trying to stop shipments because they see diversion if they ever catch it in the first place? Why are we doing anything with G42 again? Fine, if you really decide you want to sell chips to the UAE, at the very least give American hyperscalers the off-switch. It’s not like they would’ve walked away from that offer! America has a ton to lose in the medium term from creating another cloud provider that can service at scale, saying nothing of one that has some deeply-discomforting China ties pretty obvious even to me sitting here having never gotten classified briefings on the topic. Do the deal’s details and various private or unvoiced considerations make this deal better than it looks and answer many of these concerns? Could this be sufficient that, if looked at purely through the lens of American strategic interests, this deal was a win versus the salient alternatives? Again: That is all certainly possible! Our negotiating position could have been worse than Jordan believes. We could have gotten important things for America we aren’t mentioning yet. The administration could have limited room to maneuver including by being divided against itself or against Congress on this. On the flip side, there are some potentially uncharitable explanations for all of this, that would be reasonable to consider. Instead of understanding and engaging with such concerns and working to allay them, Sacks has repeatedly decided to make this a mask off moment, and engage in a response that I would expect on something like the All-In Podcast or in a Twitter beef, but which is unbecoming of his office and responsibilities, with multiple baseless vibe and ad hominem attacks at once that reflect that he either is willfully ignorant of the views, goals and beliefs of those he is attacking and even who they actually are, or he is lying and does not care, or both, and a failure to take seriously the concerns and objections being raised. Here is another illustration of this: David Sacks (May 17): After the Sam Bankrun-Fraud fiasco, it was necessary for the Effective Altruists to rebrand. So they are trying to position themselves as “China Hawks.” But their tech deceleration agenda is the same, and it would cost America the AI race with China. There are multiple other people I often disagree with on important questions but whom I greatly respect who are working on in administration on AI policy. There are good arguments you can make in defense of this deal. Instead of making those arguments in public, we repeatedly get this. Everything Sacks says seems to be about vibes and implications first and actual factual claims a distant second at best. He doesn’t logically say ‘all so-called China hawks who don’t agree with me are secret effective altruists in trench coats and also decels who hate all technology and all of humanity and also America,’ but you better believe that’s the impression he’s going for here. Would China have preferred to ‘do this deal’ instead? That at best assumes facts, and arguments, not in evidence. It depends what they would get out of such a deal, and what we’re getting out of ours, and also the security arrangements and whether we’ve formed a long lasting relationship in which we hold the cards. I’m also not even sure what it would mean for China to have ‘done this deal,’ it does not have what we are offering. Semianalysis says they don’t have similar quantities of chips to sell, and might not have any, nor are their chips of similar quality. I do agree China would have liked to ‘do a deal’ in some general sense, where they bring UAE/KSA into their orbit, on AI and otherwise, although they don’t need access to electrical power. More capital and friends are always helpful. It’s not clear what that deal would have looked like. [Jordan: the fact that the administration is citing some old news of Huawei promising to gift just $75m in chips to the Malaysian government (and not even today! Over two years!) is policy malpractice. Plus, this administration just made clear that using Huawei Ascend chips violates US export controls, giving America an enormously powerful lever to dissuade fence-sitting countries not to buy into what is already an inferior tech offering.] Here’s Tyler Cowen being clear eyed about some of what we are selling so cheap. The most powerful AI training facility could be in the UAE, and you’re laughing? Tyler Cowen: Of course Saudi and the UAE have plenty of energy, including oil, solar, and the ability to put up nuclear quickly. We can all agree that it might be better to put these data centers on US territory, but of course the NIMBYs will not let us build at the required speeds. Not doing these deals could mean ceding superintelligence capabilities to China first. Or letting other parties move in and take advantage of the abilities of the Gulf states to build out energy supplies quickly. Energy and ability to overcome NIMBYs is only that which is scarce because America is refusing to rise to this challenge and actually enable more power generation. Seriously, is there nowhere in America we can make this happen at scale? If we wanted to, we could do this ourselves easily. We have the natural gas, even if nuclear would be too slow to come online. It is a policy choice not to clear the way. And no, I see zero evidence that we are pulling out the stops here and coming up short. I think this frame is exactly correct - that this deal makes sense if and only if all of: The security deal is robust and we retain functional control over where the compute goes. We trust our friends here to remain our friends at a reasonable price. We counterfactually would not have been able to buy these chips and build data centers to power these chips. As far as I can tell China already has all the power it needs to power any AI chips it can produce, it is using them all, and its chip efforts are not funding constrained. So for want of electrical power, and for a few dollars, we are handing over a large amount of influence over the future to authoritarian powers with very different priorities and values? Tyler Cowen: In any case, imagine that soon the world’s smartest and wisest philosopher will soon again be in Arabic lands. We seem to be moving to a world where there will be four major AI powers — adding Saudi and UAE — rather than just two, namely the US and China. But if energy is what is scarce here, perhaps we were headed for additional AI powers anyway, and best for the US to be in on the deal? Who really will have de facto final rights of control in these deals? Plug pulling abilities? What will the actual balance of power and influence look like? Exactly what role will the US private sector play? Will Saudi and the UAE then have to procure nuclear weapons to guard the highly valuable data centers? Will Saudi and the UAE simply become the most powerful and influential nations in the Middle East and perhaps somewhat beyond? Yes. Those are indeed many of the right questions, once you think security is solid. Who is in charge of these data centers in the ways that matter? Won’t they at minimum have the ability to cut the power at any time? Who gets to decide where the compute goes? What are they going to do with all this leverage we are handing them? Is this what it means to have the future be based on American or Democratic values? Do you like ‘the values’ of the UAE and Saudi Arabian authorities? Tyler Cowen: I don’t have the answers to those questions. If I were president I suppose I would be doing these deals, but it is very difficult to analyze all of the relevant factors. The variance of outcomes is large, and I have very little confidence in anyone’s judgments here, my own included. Few people are shrieking about this, either positively or negatively, but it could be the series of decisions that settles our final opinion of the second Trump presidency. The administration thinks that the compute in question will remain under the indefinitely control of American tech companies, to be directed as we wish. Sriram Krishnan: Reflecting on what has been an amazing week and a key step in global American AI dominance under President Trump. These Middle East AI partnerships are historic and this “AI diplomacy” will help lock in the American tech stack in the region, help American companies expand there while also building infrastructure back in the U.S to continue expanding our compute capacity. This happens on top of rigorous security guarantees to stop diversion or unauthorized access of our technology. More broadly this helps pull the region closer to the U.S and aligns our technological interests in a very key moment for AI. It’s a very exciting moment and a key milestone. I hope that they are right about this, but I notice that I share Tyler’s worry that they are wrong. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Humain is going to get ‘several hundred thousand’ of Nvidia’s most advanced processors, starting with 18k GB300 Grace Blackwells. The justification given for rescinding the Biden diffusion rules is primarily that failure to do this would have ‘weakened diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.’ But, well, not to reiterate everything I said last week, but on that note I have news. One, we’re weakening diplomatic relations with essentially all countries in a series of unforced errors elsewhere, and we could stop. [Jordan: that feeling when you treat Dubai better than Canada] Two, most of the listed tier two countries have always had second-tier status. There’s a reason Saudi Arabia isn’t in Five Eyes or NATO. We can talk price about which countries should have which status, but no our relations are not all created equal, not when it comes to strategically vital national interests and to deep trust. I don’t share Sacks’s stated view that these are some of our closest and most trustworthy allies. Why does this administration seem to always want to make its deals mostly with authoritarian regimes, usually in places where Trump has financial ties? Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NY Times): The announcements of the two deals follow reports that $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies over the last month from the Middle East, including a Saudi-backed investment in Trump’s cryptocurrency and plans for a new presidential airplane from Qatar. There’s always Trust But Verify. The best solution, if you can’t trust, is often to set up things so that you don’t have to. This can largely be done. Will we do it? And what will we get in return? What is announced mostly seems to be investments and purchases, that what we are getting are dollars, and Bloomberg is skeptical of the stated dollar amounts. This deal is very much not a first best solution. It is, at best, a move that we are forced into on the margin due to our massive unforced errors in a variety of other realms. Even if it makes sense to do this, it makes even more sense to be addressing and fixing those other critical mistakes. Electrical power is the most glaring in the context of this particular. There needs to be national emergency level focus on America’s inability to build electrical power capacity. Where are the special compute zones? Where are the categorical exemptions? Where is DOGE with regard to the NRC? Where is the push for real reform on any of these fronts? Instead, we see story after story of Congress actively moving to withdraw even the supports that are already there, including plans to outright abrogate contracts on existing projects. The other very glaring issue is trade policy. If we think it is this vital to maintain trade alliances and open up markets, and maintaining market share, why are we otherwise going in the opposite direction? Why are we alienating most of our allies? And so on. The argument for this deal is, essentially, that it must be considered in isolation. That other stuff is someone else’s department, and we can only work with what we have. But this is a very bitter pill to be asked to swallow, especially as Sacks himself has spoken out quite loudly in favor of many of those same anti-helpful policies, and the others he seems to be sitting out. You can argue that he needs to maintain his political position, but if that also rules out advocating for electrical power generation and permitting reform, what are we even doing? If we swallow the entire pill, and consider these deals only on the margin, without any ability to impact any of our other decisions, and only with respect to ‘beating China’ and ability to ‘win the AI race,’ and assume fully good faith and set aside all the poor arguments and consider only the steelman case, we can ask: Do these deals help us? I believe that such a deal is justifiable, again on the margin and regarding our position with respect to China, if and only if ALL of the following are true: Security arrangements are robust, the chips actually do remain under our physical control and we actually do determine what happens with the compute. And things are set up such that America retains the leverage, and we can count on UAE/KSA to remain our friends going forward. This was essentially the best deal we could have gotten. This represents a major shift in our or China’s ability to stand up advanced AI chips, because for the bulk of these chips either Big Tech would have run out of money, or we would have been unable to source the necessary electrical power, or China has surplus advanced AI chips I was not previously aware of and no way to deploy them. Entering into these partnerships is more diplomatically impactful, and these friendships are more valuable, than they appear to me based on public info. ChinaTalk is a reader-supported publication.

I spent two years in a China Studies master’s program. It was fun reading Dream of the Red Chamber and Xi speeches — but I really wish I had come out of it with some hard skills, too. Had I only known about the University of San Francisco’s new Master of Science in Applied Economics Excellent commentary. I'm increasingly baffled by the inconsistencies in how the administration views AI. On one hand, it's the most important technology of the century, and will definitively decide the outcome of the U.S.-China competition. Yet we're willing to outsource and offshore data center development. I realize the analogy is flawed, but it has the same feeling as saying we want to outsource production of the B-21 because we have too many regulations, it will take too long to get permits and build, we can't afford it, and BTW we'll be able to provide oversight and monitoring of the manufacturing plant. Not something we would do in a million years. So if AI is that critical, why would we ever agree to this chip sales/data center deal--purported to result in what will become the largest cluster in the world? (While cutting BIS resources.) Rather than being about national self-interests, this has all the earmarks of a pure transactional agreement, centered on money and power. And while it's easy to be skeptical of the claims about AGI and ASI, if the assertion is that AI is going to be the most powerful, game-changing tech of the century, why should we ever stop states from trying to implement reasonable oversight and regulations? The states are doing it because there's a major gap at the federal level. The hyperbolic claims about over-regulation of AI during the previous administration are belied by the facts on the ground. In reality, the previous EOs directed very little regulation, outside mandating a number of actions within the government itself. I'm all for smart, tailored, less intrusive regulations. But it's really hard to justify scant or no regulatory actions, at the same time the administration is arguing that this technology will forever change the world. We're trying to create another Taiwan we have to protect lol No posts Ready for more?

Title: Bond Yields & Stocks: Something’s Happening Here
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/05/25/bond-yields--stocks-somethings-happening-here/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T12:24:45Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds Government bond yields in the U.S. have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the north has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the U.S. has seen slightly lower yields. 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the U.S. currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the U.S. dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The U.S. dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker U.S. dollar do not uniformly lead to higher U.S. Treasury bond yields. US Dollar Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend. Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the U.S. fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The U.S. Senate will almost certainly make some changes. So, the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the U.S. and global economy. President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields does not point to a U.S.-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the U.S. is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

With the bond-market selloff spooking investors across the board, stocks finished last week in the red. The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all fell. Disappointing retail data kept piling up, too, with Target’s earnings portraying a sharp drop in confidence among middle and high-income households, while Home Depot and Lowe’s showed a slowdown in home renovations. New data released by the National Association of Realtors added to the drama, as existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million in April — down 0.5% from March and 2.4% from a year ago. Now investors are set to return from Memorial Day barbecues to a shorter yet still jam-packed week. Here’s what to watch: U.S. markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. Tuesday kicks off the shortened trading week with a batch of earnings that should offer fresh data into how American consumers are faring — and feeling. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ+0.59%) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM-0.29%) both report before the bell. Analysts will be watching BJ’s for any signs of trading-down behavior or shrinking basket sizes, both windows into customers’ confidence levels. Okta (OKTA-0.92%) also reports Tuesday, with analysts expecting positive earnings vs. a quarterly loss this time last year. Wednesday is the marquee day of the week, with heavyweight earnings from Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), the third-largest company in America by market cap, as well as Salesforce (CRM-0.74%) and Veeva Systems (VEEV-0.13%), plus the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s report after the bell will surely be the most closely watched: The chipmaker has become a virtual stand-in for the AI wave and global chip war, and analysts are predicting as much as a 7% move in the price. Also after market close, Salesforce will offer updates on enterprise software spending amid growing economic uncertainty. Veeva will shed light on cloud-based trends in pharma and biotech. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS-3.06%) is also set to report. The biggest macro flashpoint comes at 2:00 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May 6-7 meeting. No surprises are expected, but with investors speculating whether rate cuts might come in the second half of 2025, you can expect articles analyzing the log for any insight into inflation, the labor market, or internal dissent. Costco (COST-0.22%), Dell, Zscaler (ZS+0.24%), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA-0.04%) all report Thursday. Investors will be watching Costco for traffic trends, membership retention, and its food versus discretionary sales mix, especially given Walmart’s (WMT+0.77%) recent gains in grocery. Ulta Beauty’s report will portray the health of mascara and shampoo spending — areas that often remain surprisingly strong even when consumers pull back in other categories. Gotta keep those highlights looking fresh, no matter the macro outlook. Dell Technologies (DELL-3.07%) and Zscaler round out the day’s marquee tech names. Dell’s outlook will be read for enterprise PC refresh cycles and demand for AI-capable hardware, while Zscaler’s earnings will offer a look at corporate cybersecurity priorities in an atmosphere of belt-tightening. With no major economic releases or U.S.-listed heavyweights reporting, Friday may make for a quieter session — a nice little reprieve after the flurry of earnings and macro headlines. Only Up Fintech (TIGR-0.42%), a large China-based brokerage firm, is scheduled to report. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Seattle-based ElastixAI, founded just months ago by veteran engineers behind Apple's AAPL $200 million acquisition of Xnor, has raised $16 million from top-tier investors, including Bellevue-based capital venture company FUSE. The stealth-mode startup with elite Apple pedigree is quietly tackling one of the most expensive pain points in artificial intelligence deployment: inference, GeekWire reports. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The founding team behind ElastixAI is no stranger to cutting-edge AI. According to GeekWire, CEO Mohammad Rastegari was co-founder and chief technology officer of Xnor, which was acquired by Apple in 2020 for its groundbreaking edge-based AI tools. He spent four years at Apple following the acquisition and most recently served as a distinguished scientist at Meta META. Rastegari is also an affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington and spent five years at the Allen Institute for AI, co-founded by the late Microsoft MSFT visionary Paul Allen, GeekWire says. Chief technology officer Saman Naderiparizi, who led hardware engineering at Xnor, was also a senior engineering manager at Apple. He's joined by third co-founder Mahyar Najibi, a former Apple engineer who also spent time at Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, GeekWire reports. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. While training AI models gets most of the headlines, inference is where the real-world costs pile up. According to TechTarget, every time a chatbot generates or replies to a question, a recommendation system suggests a new item or a smart device reacts to a real-world prompt, the model is performing inference. These post-deployment processes happen at scale and in real time, often thousands or millions of times a day. That volume drives up compute costs, latency concerns, and energy consumption. GeekWire says that ElastixAI is focused on flexibility and configurability, giving enterprises and hyperscalers the ability to tune their inference infrastructure to specific needs. Whether running on edge devices or large cloud environments, the company's software-centric platform is designed to reduce both compute load and operational cost. “We saw a gap when it comes to delivering AI inference at scale and at low cost,” Rastegari told GeekWire. The startup remains in stealth, but its positioning puts it in conversation with major players like Nvidia NVDA, Coreweave CRWV, and inference-focused startups such as Fireworks.ai and Together.ai, GeekWire says. See Also: Be part of the next med-tech breakthrough for only $350 — 500+ surgeries already done with nView's AI system. The $16 million round includes participation from Catapult, Tyche Partners, Liquid 2 Ventures, and DNX Ventures, according to GeekWire. Cameron Borumand, general partner at FUSE, told GeekWire the firm was "thrilled to back the elite technical founders at Elastix to solve the hardest problems around scaling compute and infrastructure in the fast-growing AI inference market." The company is also well-placed within Seattle's booming AI scene. With Apple's growing presence in the region and continued investment in foundational technologies, ElastixAI has access to both talent and infrastructure, according to GeekWire. As AI demand continues to surge, inference platforms are becoming critical infrastructure. ElastixAI's unique combination of flexibility, leadership, and investor confidence may position it as one of the most closely watched stealth startups of the future.
