Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Stock futures rose Sunday after a temporary reprieve from tariffs on electronic imports from China by the Trump administration. Dow futures were up 0.5%, or 212 points. The S&P 500 futures rose 0.75%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures gained 1.26%, as of 6:18 pm ET. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronic imports from reciprocal tariffs; any of those goods manufactured in China — like computers, phones and semiconductors — would still be subject to the 20% tariff Trump previously imposed on Chinese goods. The gains come after stocks have seesawed wildly in recent days, as President Donald Trump has levied massive tariffs on US trading partners, then backed off many of those import taxes. Still, confusion about how permanent or temporary some tariff moves could be has stoked uncertainty among investors and kept stocks, the dollar and even US Treasuries under pressure. Tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) rely on Chinese manufacturing, and the reciprocal tariffs would have made goods like iPhones and other consumer products more expensive. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the exemption was “not permanent.” Other administration officials said another slate of tariffs could be imposed after an investigation into the national security effects of semiconductor imports. Trump posted to his Truth Social platform that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” The back-and-forth on tariffs has caused many investors and others to hold off on major decisions until they get clarity. “Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing ‘red light, green light’ with tariffs and saying, ‘Oh, and for my special donors, you get a special exemption,’” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump has imposed various tariffs in recent weeks, after repeatedly postponing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and automotive imports. A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on all countries, and higher rates were imposed on roughly 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders,” including tariffs on Cambodia (49%), Vietnam (46%) and the European Union (20%). Stocks plunged on April 3 after the news, with two consecutive sessions of sell-offs that wiped nearly $6 trillion in market value and continued with another volatile day on Monday, April 7, as the tariff chaos continued.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft can 'breathe a huge sigh of relief' after Trump's China tariff exemptions

Time Published: 2025-04-12T17:39:00Z

The ever-growing U.S. tariffs on imports from China won’t bite Big Tech so badly after all, after the Trump administration late Friday laid out significant exemptions from its wider trade war that include smartphones, laptop computers, chips, and more. The exemptions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, amount to a huge break for tech giants such as Apple (AAPL+3.79%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%), and for the broader tech industry, even as uncertainty persists over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war. It means some of the most crucial and high-end technology imports — which overwhelmingly aren’t made in the U.S. — won’t be subject to Trump’s 125% tariff on China, or his baseline 10% tariff on almost every other country. A Wall Street analyst quickly called it “the best news possible for tech investors.” “The U.S. tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House, the reality of the situation was finally recognized in the Beltway,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Saturday. “There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations. Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday.” The exemptions follow a pattern from Trump’s first term, when Apple in particular saw significant success in lobbying Trump for trade war carveouts. Making products such as the iPhone in America would be almost economically impossible. Wedbush had warned earlier this month that Apple faced a “complete disaster” from the China tariffs. And the Trump administration’s move came as its trade war has driven days of volatility in financial markets, as well as cratering consumer confidence and growing recession fears. Ives called the exemptions “a big step forward for U.S. tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend. ... Big Tech is back off the cliff with these exemptions and this changes the entire situation for tech stocks with this black swan event for the industry removed.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: UBS: Taiwan’s Surging Exports Imply A Data Center Revenue Of $42 Billion For NVIDIA’s April-Ending Quarter

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With President Trump's global trade war rapidly morphing into a tit-for-tat tariff-related one-upmanship between the US and China, NVIDIA is now finding itself at the very center of this maelstrom, replete with opportunities and challenges that such a strategic position almost always entails. We got a glimpse of NVIDIA's elevated negotiating power recently when it was able to win an unfettered exemption from the Trump administration to continue selling AI-critical H20 GPUs in China. Now, UBS is out with a fresh note that leverages Taiwan's surging exports - presumably boosted by tariff-related pull-ins - to quantify the upside for NVIDIA's data center sales in the April-ending quarter. To wit, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri notes that Taiwan's exports of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) equipment ex laptops clocked-in at $12.03 billion for March 2025, corresponding to a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 20.6 percent relative to February's export figure of $9.97 billion. Arcuri points out that March is historically the strongest export month for Taiwan, typically recording MoM growth of mid-20 percent over February's figures. This means that Taiwan's export figures for March were a tad weaker than what historical analogs would imply. The UBS analyst, however, takes pains to note that Taiwan just witnessed its "strongest February in over a decade (+14% M/M relative to -15% historical seasonality)." The analyst then asserts: "Assuming April constitutes a "normal" 36% of total F1Q (Apr Q) would imply ~$34B of exports - a large step-up of ~58% Q/Q - although it is unclear to what extent this reflects tariff pull-ins rather than underlying strength." Basically, if Taiwan's April exports follow their historical pattern, the country would likely record a quarter-over-quarter export growth of 58 percent. According to Arcuri, this level of exports would imply an 18 percent quarter-over-quarter growth in NVIDIA's data center revenues: "We model NVDA's data center revenue up 18% Q/Q to $42B in Apr Q." While the UBS analyst cautions that Taiwan's export data has not been predictive of NVIDIA's data center sales for the past few quarters, his overall thesis is bolstered by TSMC recently reporting "above-seasonality" sales for March 2025. Of course, this comes as Citi has just lowered its total GPU sales forecast for NVIDIA by 3 percent for the ongoing CY 2025, and 5 percent for the CY 2026, citing "mostly lower Microsoft capex concerns and higher risk of pause in enterprise investments amid uncertainty around the global economy due to ongoing trade war." Meanwhile, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." Accordingly, Lynx Equity now expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

Title: Bitcoin’s Recent Drawdown Proves Its More Than Just a Leveraged Tech Play

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has fallen below 100 and gold has surged to new all-time highs as escalating tariffs have heightened global economic uncertainty. Consequently, asset prices have taken a hit—most notably in the tech sector and cryptocurrencies. Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, bitcoin’s drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown. To highlight bitcoin’s resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly. This comparison underscores how bitcoin has grown more resilient over time as its market cycles progress and the asset continues to mature.

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), Apple (AAPL+3.79%), Amazon (AMZN-1.08%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-1.69%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+2.02%), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC+4.31%), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR+6.03%), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA+2.20%). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: Lynx Equity: NVIDIA’s “Minimal-Tariff Status” Is A Win For Micron And Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares were brutally bruised in the recent tariff-related turmoil. However, now as President Trump seems to have stepped away from the proverbial precipice, Lynx Equity expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs, accruing outsized benefits for its key supply chain partners - the provider of high-performance memory and storage solutions, Micron, and the retailer of servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI). For the benefit of those who might not be aware, President Trump has now instituted a 10 percent baseline tariff for all major trading partners of the US except China, which is currently subjected to a 125 percent tariff. This situation is expected to persist for the next 90 days, during which the US now expects to conclude agreements with its major trading partners. Bear in mind that the tariffs on the import of vehicles and auto parts into the US persist at 25 percent, as do the import levies on aluminum and steel. For its part, China has imposed a tariff of 84 percent on all imports from the US. .@AnnaEconomist's work suggests roughly similar levels of tariffs under the new announcement. Certainly not looking like a big relief here. pic.twitter.com/C4sRzDv014 — Bob Elliott (@BobEUnlimited) April 10, 2025 Despite the prevailing euphoria, we note that the average tariff rate that the US applies to its imports has not decreased materially despite Trump's off-ramp. This is primarily due to the punitive levies that imports from China still remain subjected to. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." The firm goes on to note: "Due to tariff mitigation plans NVDA has in place, we are now calling for NVDA to return to recent highs, despite potential downside to data center capex expectations." Specifically, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA can viably reach a stock price target of $140, which corresponds to a multiple of 31x to the consensus EPS expectations for the calendar year 2025. Lynx Equity also believes that Micron and Super Micro Computer would accrue outsized benefits from NVIDIA's tariff mitigation strategy: "As part of the NVDA supply chain, we reiterate our preference for MU at $125 PT and SMCI at $60 PT." Finally, the research house also expects Dell to emerge as a relative winner in the prevailing situation. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

April 10, 2025 09:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Manufactures are projected to see increased manufacturing and sales in the global drone market for the coming several years. Rapid advancements in drone technology are significantly contributing to the drones market growth. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and improved sensor technology have enhanced the capabilities of drones, enabling them to perform more complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency. The integration of AI and ML, for instance, allows drones to analyze data in real-time, optimize flight paths, and make autonomous decisions. Furthermore, advancements in battery technology and propulsion systems have improved the endurance and range of drones, allowing them to operate for longer periods and cover greater distances. With the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly drones, market players are focusing on delivering drones with enhanced payload capacities, durability, and flight times. A report from Research And Markets said that the global drones market size aided by the increasing adoption of drones across various sectors, including agriculture, defense, logistics, and entertainment, the market is projected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 22.4% through 2032 to reach a value of USD 244.95 billion by 2032.” Active Companies in the drone industry today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE: UAVS), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). The report said: “As per the global drones market analysis, the increasing interest in urban air mobility (UAM) and the potential for passenger drones and air taxis represent a transformative opportunity for the transportation sector. Several companies and startups are already developing drone-based urban transport solutions, which could redefine urban mobility and create new market segments in the coming years. In conclusion, the global drones market value is set to increase in the coming years, driven by advancements in technology, expanding applications, and increasing demand across a wide range of sectors. Despite facing regulatory challenges and high costs, the market is set to witness robust expansion as drones become an integral part of modern industries, from agriculture to logistics to entertainment. By 2032, the market is expected to achieve remarkable growth, providing numerous opportunities for innovation, investment, and development across the globe.” ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Closes Miller Land Surveying Corporation, a Third Southeast Acquisition and a Fourth Nationally for the Drone as Service (DaaS) Rollout - ZenaTech, Inc. (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS and Quantum Computing solutions, announces the closing of its acquisition of Miller Land Surveying Corporation (“Miller”) of Lake Worth, Florida, a land survey and mapping company with a 40 year history and deep portfolio of business customers in the Palm Beach County area of South Florida. This is ZenaTech’s third acquisition in the Southeast region as part of a larger national roll-up strategy to disrupt the land survey industry by accelerating the use of drones for their speed and accuracy benefits. The acquisition also furthers the Company’s national Drone as a Service, or DaaS, business rollout as the fourth US acquisition. “Miller Land Surveying brings a wealth of experience and customer relationships as a second-generation company known across Palm Beach County for quality land surveys and mapping. Their pioneering team is well suited to helping us bring drone innovation to premium residential and business land surveys. This acquisition is another step towards our vision to create a national DaaS business, bringing AI drone efficiencies and precision to a variety of legacy business verticals and manual tasks,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. ZenaTech’s DaaS business will incorporate the ZenaDrone 1000 and the IQ series of multifunction autonomous drones to provide a variety of service solutions from land surveys to power line inspections or power washing, made accessible and cost effective through an Uber-like business model on a regular subscription or pay-per-use basis. Customers can conveniently access drones for eliminating manual or time-consuming tasks achieving superior results, such as for surveying, inspections, security and law enforcement, or precision farming applications, without having to buy, operate, or maintain the drones themselves. The DaaS business model offers customers such as government agencies, real estate developers, construction firms, farmers or energy companies reduced upfront costs as there is no need to purchase expensive drones, as well as convenience, as there is no need to manage maintenance and operation. The model also offers scalability to use more often or less often based on business needs and enables access to advanced drone technology sensors or attachments like spraying, without the need for specialized training. Accurate land surveys are essential for the planning, designing, and executing of roads, bridges, and building projects for cities, commercial, and residential projects, and are required for legal purposes. Remotely piloted drones with an array of sensors and cameras, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and GPS systems for capturing high-resolution pictures and data are revolutionizing the land survey industry gathering aerial data across expansive terrains in a matter of hours instead of weeks or months using more traditional photogrammetry methods.

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound Wednesday after President Donald Trump abruptly hit pause on sweeping tariffs for most countries. The 90-day delay — announced shortly after the duties took effect — whipsawed stocks and rocked major indices. But a little more than an hour before markets opened Thursday, stocks looked poised to slump again. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 537 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 futures were off 1.7% and Nasdaq futures were off 2.1%. After Trump announced the pause on Wednesday, the Nasdaq surged 12.1% — its second-biggest daly gain on record — while the Dow jumped more than 3,000 points for the first time in history, closing up 8%. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%. Some of the market’s most battered names led the charge, with Apple (AAPL+3.79%) stock rising 15%, both Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) and Intel (INTC+4.31%) jumping more than 18%, and Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) rallying 23%. Meta (META-1.69%) and Amazon (AMZN-1.08%) also logged double-digit gains, underscoring how sudden, top-down policy reversals don’t just move markets. They redistribute billions of dollars to those positioned — and in fact publicly encouraged — to capitalize. Here’s what to watch on Thursday. CarMax (KMX-0.78%) reports earnings Thursday morning, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.66 on $5.97 billion in revenue — up sharply from $0.32 per share a year ago. As the top U.S. used car seller, CarMax is a key gauge of consumer health. Used car sales straddle interest rates, credit access, and household budgets, making them a prime barometer of macro pressure. Softening demand or tighter lending could flag middle-class strain, especially among subprime buyers. And with CarMax offering in-house financing, any signs of rising delinquencies or tightened credit standards may echo the recessionary signals analysts fear could appear in bank earnings Friday. The first major financial firms to report, BlackRock (BLK+2.04%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%), will kick off bank earnings season Friday morning. BlackRock’s results are expected to shed light on investor risk appetite and ETF flow trends in a choppy bond market. That’s because few institutions offer a clearer window into where money is actually moving. BlackRock reflects bond market demand primarily through its fixed income fund flows. As the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion AUM, it runs a massive range of ETFs and mutual funds that track everything from short-term Treasuries to junk bonds. If investors are running from risk — or chasing yield — BlackRock’s books may demonstrate the shift. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, offers a read on the health of deal-making and IPO activity — both of which have slowed amid rising rates and global uncertainty. Together, the two are likely to set the tone for how Wall Street is navigating 2025’s volatile whiplash economy.
