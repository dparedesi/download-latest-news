August 18, 2025 15:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: COLOGNE, Germany, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gamescom -- NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture is coming to GeForce NOW™, marking the cloud gaming platform’s biggest update yet. The upgrade brings NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5080-class performance, AI enhancements and cloud storage to set new standards for cloud gaming. With thousands of more games on the way, the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will deliver cutting-edge graphics and the fastest frame rates in the cloud without raising membership prices. “Bringing the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, one of the world’s most important computer graphics innovations, to GeForce NOW represents the biggest leap in cloud gaming ever,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Blackwell, GeForce NOW offers even more stunning graphics, the fastest frame rates and negligible latency to turn any device into a high-quality gaming rig that rivals nearly every other product on the market today.” Members will gain advanced features like NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, pushing streaming up to 5K resolution at 120 frames per second (fps) — previously only possible with the most advanced gaming PCs. The upgrade adds support for up to 360 fps at 1080p with NVIDIA Reflex technology and click-to-pixel response times as low as 30 milliseconds. Tapping a global network of NVIDIA SuperPODs, the majority of gamers in GeForce NOW-supported regions will see sub-30-millisecond network latency. In addition, a new Cinematic-Quality Streaming (CQS) mode uses a host of technological advancements to significantly improve image quality. Borderlands 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and The Outer Worlds 2 are among the new AAA games that will join GeForce NOW, now totaling more than 2,300 games. That number will double instantly with the launch of Install-to-Play, a feature that brings more of gamers’ PC collections to the cloud with new cloud storage. The Ultimate UpgradeThe NVIDIA Blackwell architecture features enhanced ray tracing and AI-powered rendering, enabling more realistic lighting, richer textures and faster computation to run real-time graphics for even the most demanding games. With the introduction of GeForce RTX 5080-class GPUs, the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier will deliver a stunning 62 teraflops of compute performance and a massive 48GB frame buffer, which enables AI-enhanced gaming experiences and prepares the platform for the future of AI in gaming. The latest GPU architecture offers up to 2.8x faster frame rates compared with previous-generation servers and outpaces the PlayStation 5 Pro by more than 3x. Enhanced by the latest AMD “Zen 5” CPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX®-7 SmartNICs, GeForce NOW features the most advanced hardware in cloud gaming. Plus, NVIDIA’s broadband connectivity and mobile partner network continues to grow, with new collaborations with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom AG and more. Comcast is enhancing low-latency GeForce NOW cloud gaming through the DOCSIS telecommunications standard, Deutsche Telekom AG is integrating GeForce NOW into its 5G+ network and BT Group plans to trial L4S and 5G slicing to deliver consistent, high-quality 5G performance — whether at home or on the go. Cinematic-Quality StreamingMembers will experience a noticeable leap in graphics fidelity with CQS for the highest-quality visual experiences in the cloud. CQS features a suite of technologies powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, delivering: Games MultiplierPublishers are bringing the biggest blockbusters and acclaimed indie hits to GeForce NOW, expanding its cloud library of preinstalled, ready-to-play games to over 2,300 titles. A host of AAA games will be available to play in the cloud at launch. Upcoming releases include Hell Is Us, a mystery adventure from Nacon, followed by 2K’s and Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 4 and Techland’s Dying Light: The Beast. “NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade is a game-changer for Gearbox that significantly elevates the gameplay experiences for our players,” said Brian Burleson, vice president of strategic partnerships at Gearbox Entertainment. “GeForce NOW brings the games and universes within them to almost any screen imaginable so that every last detail we’ve worked so hard on is visible. We’re proud to be part of this next era of cloud gaming.” “Castor Woods in Dying Light: The Beast is the most beautiful world we ever created, with huge improvements to dynamic lighting, physics and graphics,” said Tymon Smektała, Dying Light franchise director at Techland. “With GeForce NOW’s Blackwell architecture, these improvements will be available to more players than ever, even those without high-end PCs at home.” Gamers can also look forward to the return of the beloved sci-fi role-playing game The Outer Worlds 2 from Obsidian Entertainment; the sci-fi action of Embark Studio’s Arc Raiders; as well as the highly anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive and White Wolf. The heart-pounding Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from Activision is also joining the cloud at launch, as well as a new sci-fi third-person shooter from BigFire Games and NCSoft called CINDER CITY. “We’re focused on giving players more choice in how and where they play, and NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade helps us do that,” said Craig Duncan, head of Xbox Game Studios. “With enhanced performance and visual fidelity, it’s now easier for players to jump into their favorite worlds, connect with friends and discover new adventures.” Also new with the GeForce NOW upgrade, Install-to-Play games are made possible by cutting-edge cloud storage servers using high-performance NVIDIA NVMesh technology. Members will gain access to double the game catalog, streaming more than 2,200 additional Steam titles that publishers have enabled for cloud streaming on GeForce NOW, with more to come. This means GeForce NOW’s library will expand to over 4,500 Ready-to-Play and Install-to-Play titles. “Seeing so many AAA and indie games arriving on GeForce NOW is a great win for studios and gamers alike,” said Larry Kuperman, vice president of business development at Nightdive Studios. “Expanding the GeForce NOW library with thousands of additional Steam titles means more gamers than ever can experience our worlds — seamlessly and instantly, on nearly any device — for a true PC experience in the cloud.” Install-to-Play games are downloaded directly to cloud storage, mirroring the experience of having them on a local PC. GeForce NOW Ultimate and Performance members will receive 100GB of single-session cloud storage for Install-to-Play games at no additional cost to their membership. Members will also be able to expand their cloud storage with persistent storage add-ons: 200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month. Install-to-Play games saved in persistent storage will remain ready to launch without the need to download and reinstall for every session. More Frames on More DevicesLaunched earlier this year, GeForce RTX 5080-powered servers are giving the native GeForce NOW app on Steam Deck a performance boost from 60 to 90 fps. LG monitors and TVs are among the first to benefit from GeForce NOW RTX 5080 server upgrades. Supported LG OLED monitors can also stream in ultra-high 5K (5120×2880) when connected to Windows or macOS devices — no extra hardware needed. LG TVs are also leading the way as the world’s first to stream 4K at 120Hz with HDR through a native app on supported LG TVs. Support for popular peripherals also grows, with native support for many Logitech racing wheels offering the lowest-latency, most responsive driving experiences. In addition, the GeForce NOW Mac client will receive all the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture upgrades, turning Apple computers into high-performance gaming machines. More Easily Connect With GamersNVIDIA, Discord and Epic are partnering to transform how people discover and play games together — making it easier than ever for gamers to stay connected. Powered by NVIDIA GeForce NOW’s game streaming technology and distributed through Discord, the new integrated experience lets players try new games instantly on Discord — no downloads, installs or launchers — without missing a beat of gameplay. This new integrated experience will let gamers try Fortnite directly in Discord, if they do not have the game installed, through a limited-time trial of the GeForce NOW Performance experience — even without a GeForce NOW membership. Players only need to create or connect their Epic accounts before instantly dropping into Fortnite. The integration makes it easier for Discord’s hundreds of millions of users to discover streamed game experiences, such as Fortnite sessions, helping game developers expand their reach where conversations about games are already happening. Pricing, Availability and PromotionsThe GeForce NOW upgrade featuring the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will begin rolling out in September. GeForce NOW Ultimate remains available for $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months, and includes access to RTX 5080 servers. Performance memberships remain available at $9.99 per month or $49.99 for six months. Daily, monthly and annual membership will be available starting at launch. Annual memberships will be available for $199.99 and $99.99, respectively. To reserve a spot to be among the first to access RTX 5080-class servers on GeForce NOW, sign up for an Ultimate membership.

Title: Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to announce its Q2 2026 earnings at the end of August (January fiscal year). Analysts anticipate earnings of $1 per share, an increase from $0.68 in the same quarter last year, and revenues are projected to grow by over 50% year-over-year to $45.60 billion. This growth is likely to be fueled by the sustained strong demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. Nvidia has been increasing large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their cutting-edge AI functionalities and premium pricing, may assist in driving revenue growth during Q2 FY’26, while also enhancing margins. Historically, NVDA stock has tended to outperform following earnings releases, having risen 60% of the time with a median one-day increase of 4.5% and a maximum observed increase of 24%. The company holds a current market capitalization of $4.4 trillion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $149 billion, and it was operationally profitable, achieving $86 billion in operating profits and a net income of $77 billion. Although much will depend on how results compare to consensus expectations, recognizing historical trends may improve your chances if you are an event-driven trader. Should you Buy Or Fear Nvidia stock? For event-driven traders, historical trends might provide an advantage, whether by positioning prior to earnings or responding to post-release movements. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than that of individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is low) is to assess the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader could position themselves “long” for the upcoming 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the association between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Occasionally, peer performance can impact post-earnings stock reactions. Indeed, the pricing-in may start before the earnings announcements are made. Here is some historical data illustrating the past post-earnings performance of NVIDIA stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings immediately before NVIDIA. For an equitable comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (the combination of all three, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), delivering strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride compared to an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception.

Title: The Cowboys Sold For $140 Million in 1989—They're Now Worth $12.8 Billion. Here's How That 9,000% Return Compares to Market Giants

The Dallas Cowboys topped the NFL's most valuable teams list, according to Sportico: Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million, over $370 million in today's dollars. Based on the new valuation, his investment has grown 9,042% from the initial $90 million cash outlay and $50 million loan. Several companies with the largest market capitalizations on the market today hadn't even been started in 1989—Microsoft and Apple were the only members of the eventual Magnificent Seven that existed at the time. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Google, now under parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), had not yet been founded. Here's a look at how the Cowboys' 9,000% gain compares to the return some of the most important stocks today, like Microsoft and Apple, have delivered since February 1989, along with how some of the companies with the largest market caps at the time have performed since. When applicable, stock prices have been adjusted to account for stock splits that have taken place in the decades since. Jerry Jones turned a $140 million bet on the Dallas Cowboys in 1989 into a $12.8 billion empire—one of the most lucrative investments in sports history. His 9,000% return rivals the long-term gains of giants like Walmart and Berkshire Hathaway, but is still dwarfed by the explosive gains of tech titans such as Microsoft and Apple.

US stock markets opened Friday on a turbulent note as investors weighed strong corporate moves against persistent inflation pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record intraday high of 45,203.52, fueled by gains in healthcare stocks. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped to 21,710.67, dragged down by profit-taking in tech and cautious semiconductor forecasts. The spotlight was on UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped over 11% after Warren Buffett’s $1.57 billion stake was disclosed, signaling renewed investor confidence. Traders also digested July’s 0.9% jump in the Producer Price Index (PPI), keeping Treasury yields elevated and adding pressure on growth-oriented stocks.
