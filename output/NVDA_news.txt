ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

Title: Will The Growth Scare And Tariffs Continue To Sink Stocks?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone , Contributor. Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. ... [+] The Magnificent 7 has retreated by almost 16% since mid-December. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Performance The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time. The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case. Estimated First Quarter U.S. Economic Growth Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth. The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%. Monthly Job Growth The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again. The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn. Initial Jobless Claims The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession. Consumer Sentiment Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Trump's election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of President Biden’s term. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies. Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating. The February consumer inflation (CPI) release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome. Consumer Inflation Estimate Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt. While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio. S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. Warren Buffett’s recent annual letter did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

U.S. stocks were up on Friday as investors weighed tariff policies against signs of economic relief. As the day ended in New York, the S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 popped up 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5%. Meanwhile, February’s jobs report came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 151,000, an improvement from January’s downwardly revised 125,000 but below the projected 170,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%. Here are stocks to watch today: Broadcom (AVGO-5.67%) shares surged over 8% as the company reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations and provided strong guidance for the current quarter. Costco (COST-2.54%) shares fell 6% on Friday as the warehouse retailer slightly missed analysts’ earnings expectations. The company reported earnings of $4.02 per share, falling short of the projected $4.09. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE-4.84%) shares fell 11%, hitting a new 52-week low, as the global edge-to-cloud company issued weak guidance and initiated cost-cutting measures. AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA-4.21%) rebounded on Friday after sliding more than 5% on Thursday, possibly lifted by Broadcom’s strong earnings report. Walgreens (WBA-1.62%) shares rose 7% on Friday as the company agreed to a $10 billion acquisition by Sycamore Partners, marking a shift to a privately held company.

The stock market tariff tantrum of the past few weeks has seen the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 give up all their gains since the early November election victory of Donald Trump even as bitcoin (BTC) remains in positive territory. Both equity gauges are now more than 2% lower, while bitcoin is up over 20% in the same time frame. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips are in demand for uses in AI, for instance, is lower by more than 20% since Trump's triumph. On the flip side, Meta Platforms (META) is the stand out stock in the so-called magnificent seven technology companies having gained about 10%. While bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) is down over 50% from its all-time high in November, it remains up 20% since the election. Though bitcoin bulls are surely disappointed in the price performance of late — the world's largest cryptocurrency has slumped about 20% from $109,000 the day before Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 — the current price of $88,000 is still up roughly 20% from its level just prior to the November election.

Nvidia (NVDA-4.21%) stock fell 5.7% on Thursday, bringing its decline this year to more than 17% amid concerns about declines in spending on AI, amid a general selloff in that took the tech-centered Nasdaq 100 down 2.8%. The wider Composite index fell 2.6%. “The decline in Nvidia’s stock price has much less to do with company fundamentals and much more to do with macro considerations, namely uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy,” Will Rhind, CEO and founder of GraniteShares told Quartz in an email. “The company posted very strong Q4 earnings showing they remain at the forefront of the AI technology race.” He suggested that if trade war discussions are mostly noise, this could be an opportunity to buy Nvidia shares at their lowest valuation in a while. Rival chipmakers also fell, with Broadcom (AVGO-5.67%) plummeting 6.3% ahead of earnings, Micron (MU-5.13%) about 5.4%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-1.51%) 2.8%. The U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM-3.70%) dropped 4.6%. Marvell Technology’s (MRVL-8.88%) shares plunged almost 20% after the semiconductor company’s earnings guidance didn’t impress investors. ON Semiconductor (ON-2.07%) fell 5.6% after Allegro MicroSystems called “inadequate” ON’s unsolicited acquisition offer of $35.10 a share in cash. Meanwhile, Allegro (ALGM-5.30%) gained 5.7%, going against the tide. Outside of chipmakers, other tech giants also fell, with Meta (META-5.27%) down 4.4% and Amazon (AMZN-3.05%) declining 3.7%. The shares of Apple (AAPL-5.61%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-4.49%) fell by smaller amounts. MongoDB’s (MDB-4.82%) shares plunged 27% after the database software company issued weaker-than-expected earnings guidance.

Title: US stocks slide as tariff uncertainty persists | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The rocky week on Wall Street continued on Thursday as investors grappled with further uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. US stocks opened sharply lower but fluctuated on the mixed messaging coming from the White House. All three major indexes closed lower, despite Trump announcing a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the president would likely announce a one-month tariff delay on products that are covered by the USMCA. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, down 10% from its record high in December. That leaves the Dow down almost 3% on the week, on track for its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both on pace for their worst week since September 2024. The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 4%. Investor sentiment is struggling due to the persistent uncertainty around tariffs, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “Eventually, that uncertainty is just going to weigh too much on business decisions and those forward prospects for earnings growth,” Haworth said. Also in focus for investors: recent data revealing the extent of recent layoffs and renewed concerns about spending on artificial intelligence. Futures tied to the Dow had tumbled in early trading as new economic data showed unease in the labor market. US-based employers last month announced plans to slash 172,017 jobs, a 103% increase from January and the highest February total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s latest monthly job cuts report. Related article US employers cut more jobs last month than any February since 2009 Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 also fell in early trading as companies focused on the AI trade posted mixed earnings results and guidance for this year. Marvell Technologies (MRVL), a chipmaker, fell by almost 20%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) also slid, dragging the Nasdaq lower. Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Thursday announced its own AI model, challenging upstart DeepSeek as well as OpenAI, raising questions about whether the AI boom in the US is worth the money that is being poured into it. Thursday’s decline is a reversal of the rally on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting that investors lack clarity and confidence about the next developments in the brewing trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners. “For now, tariff-induced inflation amid slower growth could bring the economy dangerously close to stagflation,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note Wednesday. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength relative to six other currencies, fell to its lowest level since November — signaling a weakening outlook for US economic growth. Investors will be closely attuned to the government’s monthly jobs report Friday, set to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. and giving investors more insight into how the economy is doing. “I think if we see the hard data start to come in much weaker, that’ll become more and more concerning for the market,” said Haworth. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving investors for the past week, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

Title: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) March-Quarter Revenue To Be Impacted By “Blackwell Queue” And NVIDIA’s Ongoing Preference For Hyperscalers, As Per The Insights Gleaned By An Analyst From A Fireside Chat

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), one of the most prominent retailers of data center servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, has been trapped in the market's purgatory ever since the stock cleared its biggest near-term overhang by filing its requisite financial statements with the SEC in the nick of time to avoid a damaging delisting event. Now, a Wall Street analyst has stepped up to provide some much-needed context to SMCI's confounding weakness. Super Micro Computer recently provided a fairly disappointing near-term guidance, but was able to limit the fallout by aggressively ramping up its projections for FY 2026. To wit, SMCI now expects to earn $40 billion in full-year revenue in FY 2026 vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of just $29 billion. Now, Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi is out with an important investment note on Super Micro Computer's prospects. To wit, Chokshi hosted SMCI's IR team for a fireside chat on the 28th of February, after the company had filed its "delayed FY24 10K, F1Q25 10Q (Sept Q) and F2Q25 (Dec Q) 10Q on Tuesday, February 25th, NVDA reporting modest data center upside on Wednesday, February 26th and key peer DELL reporting results on Thursday, February 27th." Bear in mind that NVIDIA and CoreWeave are Super Micro Computer's biggest customers, while Dell is its biggest competitor. Before going further, do note that Super Micro Computer reported $5.65 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q2'25 and guided to a range of between $5 billion and $6 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q3'25 (March-ending quarter), which corresponds to a QoQ decline of ~6 percent at the low-end, and a QoQ increase of ~12 percent at the high-end of the range. Coming back, Chokshi notes that the stated trajectory of Super Micro Computer's March-ending quarter - "guided down 12% q/q to up 6% q/q" - is largely a function of the fact that the company's GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) customers "are unlikely to be at the front of the Blackwell queue." Here, Chokshi adds additional color by noting that Blackwell GPUs constituted ~31 percent of NVIDIA's January-ending quarter revenue, "driving NVDA data center revenue up 16% q/q, implying Hopper shipments down 20% q/q." Chokshi also notes that "consensus for DELL servers and networking is being projected flat q/q for the April Q, consistent with SMCI midpoint guidance, leading us to believe NVDA Blackwell shipments for the Jan Q indexed towards hyperscalers that DELL nor SMCI typically serve." Bear in mind that there is a roughly 8-week lag between when NVIDIA recognizes GPU revenue to when server OEMs recognize their top-line metric. So, according to Chokshi, Super Micro Computer's near-term revenue is being impacted by NVIDIA's Blackwell queue and its preferential treatment of hyperscalers.

Title: The dot-com bubble burst 25 years ago. What does that history say about stocks today?
URL: https://qz.com/dot-com-bubble-stock-market-crash-anniversary-ai-1851767436
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value from just a year earlier. Internet startups with “dot-com” slapped on the end of their names and little more than ideas to sell to investors had soared to astronomical valuations over the previous five years. But all parties come to an end. Within weeks of that high, the index began its fall, with a mix of factors spooking investors. Eventually, the Nasdaq shed more than 75% of its value, wiping out $5 trillion in market capitalization. The age of irrational exuberance was over. A quarter-century later, the rise of AI has market veterans debating whether history repeats, or merely runs the same bubble algorithm with new inputs. Some market watchers see structural differences preventing an immediate collapse, while tech critics warn we’re debugging the same old bubble logic. Beyond balance sheets lies a deeper concern: We keep forgetting that the social costs of tech revolutions outlast their market corrections. There are similarities between the market today and 25 years ago as some investors grow nervous, according to Kairong Xiao, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. But if the moment we are in ends up bursting, the market structure means things will look different than 2000. “The dot-com bubble was characterized by a lot of IPOs, with companies trying to get into the biggest asset class in the Nasdaq” Xiao said. “Today, due to regulation and many other structural changes, new investments nowadays have been through the private equity market.” That structural shift from public to private funding represents one of the most significant changes. While Netscape’s 1995 IPO sparked a gold rush of public offerings from internet startups, today’s most prominent AI developers — OpenAI and Anthropic — remain private despite valuations in the tens of billions. They can access enormous capital without facing public market scrutiny or quarterly earnings pressure. The companies leading today’s tech wave also differ markedly from their dot-com predecessors. In 2000, many market darlings were freshly minted startups with minimal revenue. Today, AI innovation is largely funded by cash-rich tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA), companies with diverse revenue streams and substantial profits. This concentration of resources among established players may provide a cushion against market volatility that didn’t exist during the dot-com era. “The big companies can survive if there’s a crash in the market because they have other ways to raise financing, whereas the small guys get eliminated,” Xiao said. Yet not all market observers are convinced we’ll avoid a reckoning entirely. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said today’s AI boom has runway left — but also an expiration date. “I still think we got another two good years left in the market,” Munster said. “Unfortunately, it’s gonna end in the same way that it did 25 years ago.” For Munster, the key indicator isn’t current valuations but the psychological state of the market, which he sees as “euphoric” right now. He defines euphoria — that intoxicating moment when rational investing gives way to the fear-of-missing-out — as when the forward price-to-earnings multiple exceeds 50 times. Today’s Nasdaq trades around 25 times earnings. But Munster said that euphoric threshold could be reached by 2027, potentially triggering what he described as a “spectacular burst.” While Munster said he believes the substance of AI will eventually exceed the hype, that likely won’t happen in time to avoid a market correction. “By the time the numbers start to improve, the bubble will have burst,” Munster said. “I lived through the dot-com bubble. I don’t want to see people’s lives get blown up, but I also think that AI is going to be more impactful than the internet.” Yet for all the structural differences between eras, some experts warn that we risk repeating the same fundamental mistakes. Mar Hicks, a history of technology professor at the University of Virginia and author of “Programmed Inequality,” said our retrospective view of previous tech bubbles often minimizes their negative impacts. Those harms, Hicks said, include substantial erosion of privacy norms and labor market transformations that began during the first internet boom. Early e-commerce companies like Kozmo.com used venture capital to offer services at unsustainably low prices, conditioning consumers to expect convenience without cost — a precursor to today’s gig economy. “That led to getting people used to this idea that you can have anything for free, essentially,” Hicks said. “It made it so that people either didn’t think about the labor and paying the labor of the people who are doing this work, or it completely changed the structure of the labor market.” Hicks suggested that while Silicon Valley’s memory may be short, its executives aren’t entirely forgetting history — they’re strategically misremembering it. Today’s AI leaders appear to have studied the dot-com collapse primarily as a public relations case study rather than a substantive business lesson. “The way in which they’re being mindful is they now know what they have to say in order to maybe get people to not get upset about these new revolutionary technologies,” Hicks said. “They’re giving lip service to it because they don’t ever address any of the real problems.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia Stock: Are Tariff Fears Overblown?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia stock fell nearly 9% during Monday’s trading session, while the broader Nasdaq index declined by just over 2%. The market-wide sell-off coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his administration would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Additionally, Nvidia’s drop was further exacerbated by investigations into Chinese buyers suspected of bypassing U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor chips. How will these developments affect Nvidia stock? We do not believe that the Trump Administration’s initial tariffs will have a material impact on Nvidia. Nvidia’s chips are primarily manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan; however, some systems and computers utilizing these chips are produced in other regions, including Mexico. It is possible that these segments of the business might experience some impact. Nonetheless, the core of Nvidia’s operations—the high-margin GPU division—should remain mostly unaffected. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Investors will need to monitor this development closely, although we believe it will not have a significant impact on Nvidia’s bottom line. As of 2024, Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. Furthermore, since Nvidia generates around 47% of its sales from the U.S., the impact on its margins is probably even more constrained. In addition, TSMC, which is Nvidia’s main contract manufacturer for GPUs, has announced plans to invest roughly $100 billion in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States. Nvidia executives have indicated that they plan to produce chips at these new facilities, potentially helping the company mitigate long-term tariff risks. However, if you are seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception. The United States has implemented export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s newest AI chipset offerings to China, with the exception of the H20 chips, due to national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are utilizing entities registered outside China to purchase servers incorporating Nvidia’s latest offerings from companies based in several countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This concern is substantiated by the fact that Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, representing approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25, or about 18% of revenue, compared to only $2.3 billion, or 8% of revenue, in FY’23. Singapore has now launched an investigation into these potential loopholes. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek open-source AI model also suggests that the country is advancing significantly in AI, with both prominent startups and major companies like Alibaba and Baidu investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Should Chinese companies bypass sanctions and face stricter enforcement measures that eventually close these loopholes, Nvidia’s revenues could be affected. Over the past four years, NVDA stock's performance has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits significantly less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic climate, marked by potential rate cuts and several conflicts, might NVDA experience a scenario similar to 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a robust surge? We estimate Nvidia stock to be valued at approximately $101 per share, which is about 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons why we currently hold a negative outlook on the stock. We believe that the AI wave, driven by a “fear-of-missing-out” over the past two years, might subside due to diminishing incremental performance improvements from larger models and because high-quality training data may become a bottleneck. This transition towards more efficient models could further intensify the effects of a potential slowdown for GPU manufacturers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia is encountering increasing competition from companies such as AMD and even from its own clients, like Amazon, which are focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. Although Nvidia boasts a comprehensive software ecosystem surrounding its AI processors—including programming languages that help secure customer loyalty—the company could still face pressure. Its premium valuation might not fully account for these risks at present. NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth
