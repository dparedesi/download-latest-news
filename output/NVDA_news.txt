Title: SPLG: This Could Be an Ideal ETF for New Investors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market’s best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). I’m bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.’s best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we’ll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a “low-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.” State Street also explains that SPLG is “one of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.” This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG’s holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which “represents approximately 80% of the US market.” This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out—rather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPLG’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. It’s worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG’s top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can’t necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you’ll find in today’s market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It’s hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG’s 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it’s still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500’s valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America’s strongest companies, and it’s difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I’m bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.

Title: xAI's value is set to double, joining Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX in reaching new heights

Two of Elon Musk’s private ventures are set to be worth a lot more, joining his sole public company in securing massive valuations. His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, CNBC reports, citing anonymous sources. Five billion dollars are expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East, while the remainder comes from domestic investors. The Financial Times previously reported that Musk had approached investors in Qatar and Saudi Arabia about backing the startup, which he launched last July as a competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI, as well as current investors like Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners. At the time, a $45 billion valuation had been floated. If the deal closes, it would more than double the $24 billion valuation xAI reached in May, when the company announced it had raised $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. The new funds are expected to go toward the acquisition of 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA) chips, CNBC reports. xAI in October won approval to expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is expected to help train Tesla’s (TSLA) AI tech, including Full Self-Driving. And SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company that plans to test a mega-rocket on Monday, is also looking to raise cash. The largest private company in the U.S. plans to launch a tender offer next month to sell existing shares at about $135 a pop, according to the Times, citing people who are knowledgeable about the discussions. With that reported offer, SpaceX would be valued at $250 billion, up from $210 billion earlier this year. It would also make it worth more than Bytedance, the company behind TikTok and the most valuable startup in the world. Both startups are likely to benefit from Musk’s tight-knit relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, who on Tuesday handed Musk an advisory board to recommend ways to slash regulations and federal spending. He’s already signaled that he will use that job to try and benefit his companies. On Friday, he agreed with investor Ron Baron’s comments that regulations should be changed so that companies don’t need to repeatedly get permits to launch rockets. He previously said he would work to streamline federal regulations for driverless vehicles, which Tesla is working on. Musk is widely expected to play a role in guiding the Trump administration’s AI initiatives. It’s easier to see what effect that relationship has on Tesla, given that it’s a public company. Since its CEO’s big bet on Trump paid off, the stock has boomed, reaching a $1 trillion valuation and surging above $300 per share for the first time since 2022. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its Q3 earnings after the bell next Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the AI trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia’s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter. Even if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results. That could have been a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time. Investors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter. Nvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He’s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Jefferies: Wall Street’s Expectation That NVIDIA Would Earn $200 Billion In Revenue In 2025 Assumes “Overly Aggressive ASPs”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. A hint of circumspection around NVIDIA appears to be creeping into the commentaries of the more discerning financial powerhouses that populate Wall Street. Consider the latest investment note from Jefferies, where the financial advisory firm adopts a markedly cautious tone vis-à-vis NVIDIA's prospects for 2025. A few weeks back, Morgan Stanley saw NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, and between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25. Fast-forward to this week, when Raymond James noted that it now saw NVIDIA shipping "around 100,000 Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which is likely at the lower end of investor expectations." The investment bank, however, was decidedly bullish on NVIDIA's 2025 prospects: "That said, we anticipate an acceleration in Blackwell ramps in 1H25, with strong demand extending through 2025." Today, it is the turn of analysts at Jefferies to expound on NVIDIA's near-term prospects. Jefferies Raises $NVDA PT to $185 from $150, Maintains Buy Rating Analyst Comments: "We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range. While expectations continue to creep higher, we believe the stock continues to work as we are in… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) November 15, 2024 To wit, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis begins by reiterating that he expects the high-flying maker of GPUs to repeat the story that has consistently played out over the past few quarters, replete "with a beat and raise in the $2B range." Curtis notes that Wall Street expects NVIDIA to earn at least $200 billion in revenue and $5 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, with some estimates reaching as high as $6 in EPS. The Jefferies analyst then notes: "While we are positive on unit upside, many of these estimates might be assuming overly aggressive ASPs, stemming from misconceptions that NVDA would sell entire racks for the GB200 NVL." Curtis expects NVIDIA to ship ~6 million GPUs in 2025, which is lower than most estimates on Wall Street: "Our roughly 6M GPU unit assumption implies DC revenue closer to $180-200B compared to buyside expectations in the $205-215B range." Despite his cautious tone, Curtis remains bullish on the GPU manufacturer's prospects, as evidenced by his reiteration of a 'Buy' rating for the stock with a target of $185 per share, up from an earlier peg at $150. "Blackwell is starting to ramp, with a 'few billion' this quarter and further growth as small volumes of the GB200 layer in next quarter. Hopper is still growing during this transition as prior deployments are filled out. We raise our estimates to reflect our updated expectations for the Blackwell ramp." NVIDIA shares are down ~2 percent at the time of writing. Year to date, the stock is up a whopping 200 percent.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) hit a new 52-week low on Thursday morning as the AI-focused hardware company struggles with filing its quarterly report (Form 10-Q) for the period ending September 30. The San Jose-based company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the delay in a recent filing, saying it needs more time to select and engage a new accounting firm to review financial statements for fiscal 2024. Having already missed the deadline for its 2024 Form 10-K or annual report, Super Micro faces a potential Nasdaq delisting. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq (NDAQ) to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. On Thursday morning, the company’s stock was trading at $18, down more than 7%. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 85%, erasing over $55 billion in value. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. More recently, the server company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The departure follows months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. After these events, Super Micro’s stock price experienced a significant decline, dropping 33% so far in 2024 and 35% over the past 12 months.

Title: 'Trees don’t grow to the sky': Nelson Peltz says the stock market's Trump 'euphoria' won't last

The stock market has been on a record-setting hot streak since Donald Trump won the White House last week. But billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz doesn’t think it will last. “No, trees don’t grow to the sky. Definitely not uninterrupted,” the Trian Partners founder said in an interview at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference. “There will be something that might upset it. I think you’ve got euphoria from the election.” Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump’s election win. These gains slowed Wednesday, with the Dow ending the day up just 0.11%, or about 47 points, the S&P 500 closing up 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling roughly 0.26%. Beyond the election-driven excitement, Peltz pointed to the high concentration of companies that currently drive the market. “You’ve got the S&P 500, and then you’ve got the S&P 20-25,” he said. “You’ve got two different markets. It’s the wrong name. You’ve got these 20 companies that are swinging the cat around the room. And then you’ve got these other companies.” That echoed observations from researchers at Goldman Sachs (GS), who have warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While they attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, another major factor fueling uncertainty is an “extremely high level of market concentration,” particularly when it comes to the 10 largest mega-cap tech stocks, the strategists said. These top 10 companies — which include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) — account for 36% of the overall index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 43%, compared with 36% for the index as a whole. Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

Title: The 12 Executives Behind Nvidia’s Unprecedented A.I. Domination

Above a table in a San Jose, Calif., Denny’s hangs a plaque that reads: “The booth that launched a $1 trillion company.” The breakfast spot is where, in 1993, engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem founded the technology company Nvidia (NVDA). As evidenced by the chain’s celebratory plaque, Nvidia surpassed the $1 trillion mark last year. Today, the company’s dominance in the A.I. revolution has boosted its market cap to nearly $3.6 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Despite its seemingly rapid rise, Nvidia’s trajectory has been in the making for some time. While the company started off with a vision to reimagine realistic 3D graphics with chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs), it faced several pitfalls along the way—including a graphics format issue in 1996 that forced Huang, the company’s CEO, to lay off more than half of its employees Three years later, Nvidia launched the industry’s first GPU, the GeForce 256, and became a major player in computer graphics and gaming. Despite its success in that industry, Huang decided to pivot toward A.I. more than a decade ago in the hopes that the nascent technology would take off. His bet has paid off handsomely, with Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) now spending billions of dollars on the Nvidia chips used to power their generative A.I. models. Besides a penchant for leather jackets, Huang is known for his unique leadership style—his executive team contains more than 60 people, all of whom report directly to the CEO. “It’s not conventional, but I’m certain that it’s the best practice,” Huang told Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, of the structure earlier this year. In addition to Nvidia’s innovation in A.I., data centers and gaming, the company is also a powerhouse in visualization and automotive technologies. Here’s a look at some of the top leaders helping Nvidia ride the A.I. wave to unprecedented heights: Huang has served as the CEO and president of Nvidia since its establishment. He owns around 3 percent of the company and has seen his personal net worth swell to an estimated $128 billion over the years, placing Huang among the ten wealthiest people in the world. Huang, who earned a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University and a master’s in electrical engineering from Stanford, previously worked at companies like LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices. But his first-ever job was as a dishwasher at Denny’s—the very same restaurant that would later serve as the location for Nvidia’s inception. “I used to clean bathrooms, and now I’m CEO of a company… There are a lot of things in life I believe you can learn,” Huang told Collison when asked why he rarely fires employees. “People know that I’d rather torture them into greatness. ” Huang’s fellow co-founder Malachowsky has held several different positions at Nvidia, where he’s overseen areas like IT, operations and product engineering. The executive, who previously held engineering and technical leadership roles at HP and Sun Microsystems, currently focuses on growing the company’s core technologies as an “Nvidia fellow” and its senior technology executive. Malachowsky is also an expert on integrated circuit design and holds some 35 patents. In addition to his work at Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, he serves as an advisor to the Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida. Kress, another member of Nvidia’s executive staff, was recruited by Huang in 2013. Her tenure at the company has included Nvidia’s entry into the $1 trillion club, and then the $3 trillion club, with Kress helping guide Nvidia’s soaring growth across its data center business. Her leadership “has been instrumental in Nvidia’s success with Wall Street and is key to Jensen’s vision,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, told Fortune in June. Before joining Nvidia, Kress was chief financial officer for Cisco’s business technology and operations finance division and spent more than a dozen years at Microsoft, where her roles included chief financial officer of its server and tools sector. As head of worldwide field operations, Puri oversees all things related to Nvidia’s global business. The executive’s responsibilities include areas like sales, partnerships, program management and organizing support services. Before joining Nvidia in 2005, Puri spent more than two decades in sales, marketing and management at Sun Microsystems, where his positions included a stint as senior vice president of its Asia-Pacific Group. Before that, Puri worked in roles at Hewlett-Packard, Booz Allen and Texas Instruments. After more than 20 years spent managing operations at companies like Quantum and Coherent, Shoquist joined Nvidia in 2007. As head of operations, she oversees Nvidia’s supply chain functions, logistics and quality management system. Shoquist’s role involves working closely with the company’s global suppliers, which notably includes the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In what constitutes one of the most lucrative partnerships in A.I., Nvidia counts on TSCMC to manufacture chips such as those belonging to its next-generation Blackwell platform. As one of Nvidia’s longest-serving employees, Diercks has been with the technology company since he became its 22nd employee in 1994. Initially joining as a senior software engineer, he has acted as senior vice president of software engineering since 2008 and leads a team that builds the software underpinning its A.I. accelerators, autonomous vehicle technology and gaming products. Diercks, who previously worked as a software engineer at Pellucid, Inc. and Compaq Computer Group, has also demonstrated an interest in A.I. applications outside of work. Earlier this year, he donated $20 million to fund programs at the Mayo Clinic that will use the new technology for early detection and cancer treatment. Like Diercks, Fisher joined Nvidia three decades ago. During the company’s early days, its initial office was so small that Nvidia employees shared an office bathroom with another company and ate their meals around a ping pong table, he recalled in 2017. Starting as the company’s first salesman, Fisher worked his way up to become the head of its GeForce business unit, which produces the company’s line of GPUs for gaming and 3D rendering. Before joining Nvidia, he previously worked in sales at Adaptec and the Weitek Corporation. Alben, since 2008, has headed GPU engineering at Nvidia, where his team focuses on enhancing the capabilities of next-gen chips. Before joining the company in 1997, he briefly worked at Silicon Graphics. “We had a vision that when we put GPUs out in the world… that somewhere somebody out there in the world would find these GPUs and would use them for some new problem that we didn’t even know about,” said Alben during a 2020 podcast interview. Ian Buck oversees Nvidia’s vast data center business. Buck has been with Huang’s company for 20 years and started as a systems engineer and director. In charge of hardware and software for data centers and A.I. applications, Buck has testified on A.I. before the U.S. Congress and urged federal agencies to invest in and adopt the new technology to bolster the economy. While completing a Ph.D. at Stanford in the early 2000s, Buck helped develop the programming language Brook. At Nvidia, his team helped build CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model introduced in 2006 that built off Buck’s Stanford research and helps developers speed up applications through GPUs. Before embarking on a 22-year career at Nvidia, Lebaredian specialized in visual effects rendering at Warner Brothers Digital and Disney Dream Quest Images and even launched his own company, Steamboat Software, in 1999. Lebaredian joined Nvidia in 2002, where he now heads the company’s Omniverse system and simulation technology. Bringing together generative A.I. with renderings and physics simulations, Nvidia’s Omniverse allows for the creation of so-called “digital twins,” which virtually replicate environments and processes to help companies solve issues across areas like factory scale, robotics development or even climate research. Shapiro has been with Nvidia since 2009 and currently heads its automotive division. In addition to working on in-vehicle improvements and automobile design, Shapiro’s team is focused on enabling A.I. self-driving through the company’s Nvidia Drive platforms. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Shapiro drives an electric vehicle powered by his California home’s solar system. Before joining Nvidia, the executive held marketing, engineering and business development positions at Advanced Micro Devices, Silicon Graphics and Digital Equipment. Siddeek and Nvidia go way back. In the 1990s, he helped the company go public while working at Morgan Stanley (MS) and subsequently joined Nvidia as an investor relations manager in the 2000s before breaking away to work at SoftBank (SFTBF)’s Vision Fund. The executive returned to Nvidia three years ago to head up NVentures, its venture capital arm. As opposed to the larger investments made through Nvidia’s corporate development division, NVentures specializes in earlier-stage startups using A.I. to advance healthcare and manufacturing. The main criterion for investments is “relevancy,” Siddeek told the Financial Times in 2023, describing “companies that use our technology, who depend on our technology, who build their businesses on our technology” as prime targets.

Title: What Nvidia wants (but may not get) from the Supreme Court

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor. So far, things aren't exactly going their way. Nvidia’s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta’s lawyers last week. “It just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,” Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia’s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal. The outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants. Nvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements. The investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia’s internal company data by misattributing the company’s demand for chips to the video gaming market. Demand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia’s company documents. “This is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,” Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia’s lawyer. The justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week. In both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits. Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices’ questions in the Facebook case. “One thing that was amazing in the oral argument,” he said, “is you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance” with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were “very pro-plaintiff.” Facebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users. At the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court. Facebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm. According to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert’s opinion. “Congress … wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,” Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday’s arguments. “When a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,” Katyal said. Katyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created “an easy road map” for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining. Gorsuch said “it beggars belief” to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income. Jim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits. “The Facebook case is somewhat closer,” he said, explaining that the social media company’s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia’s. The Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors. “We think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,” the DOJ’s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.

OpenAI is on to the next wave of artificial intelligence with an autonomous agent it reportedly plans to launch in January. The AI agent, codenamed “Operator,” can do tasks on behalf of a person, including coding and booking travel, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The startup plans to release the AI agent as a research preview and through its application programming interface (API), OpenAI leaders reportedly told staff in a meeting Wednesday. OpenAI is working on other AI-agent-related projects, including a tool that can perform tasks in a web browser, people told Bloomberg. That tool is reportedly close to completion. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The startup’s investor and partner, Microsoft (MSFT), announced in October that its Copilot AI users could build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio starting this month. The autonomous agents can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf,” Microsoft said. In July, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a future where everyone has an AI assistant. “Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs,” Huang said about Meta’s AI Studio platform, which allows users and creators to generate AI characters of themselves that can assist with different tasks. Zuckerberg added, “Just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI.” Meanwhile, OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s ability to search the web in October. ChatGPT search provides links to relevant web sources in its responses, “which you would have previously needed to go to a search engine for,” OpenAI said. With web search on ChatGPT, users can ask questions “in a more natural, conversational way.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is cutting 4% of its global workforce as it focuses on competition in the artificial intelligence chips space. “As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” a spokesperson for AMD said in a statement shared with Quartz on Wednesday. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.” The cuts target sales and marketing roles in some divisions including consumer PC and gaming PC, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The company is reportedly still hiring. AMD shares fell by around 2.3% during mid-day trading on Wednesday. In October, AMD reported third-quarter revenues of $6.8 billion — slightly above Wall Street’s expectations. “Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,” AMD chief executive Lisa Su said in a statement. Earlier that month, AMD launched its Instinct MI325X accelerators and Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors, along with other leading-edge computing chips, at its Advancing AI conference. Like rival Nvidia (NVDA), AMD is on “an annual cadence” with releasing new chips, Su said. “The data center and AI represent significant growth opportunities for AMD, and we are building strong momentum for our EPYC and AMD Instinct processors across a growing set of customers,” Su said. With its new chips, AMD is “delivering leadership compute to power our customers’ most important and demanding workloads,” she added. By 2028, AMD sees the market for data center AI accelerators reaching $500 billion, Su said, adding that the chipmaker is “committed to delivering open innovation at scale through our expanded silicon, software, network and cluster-level solutions.” This story has been updated to include a statement from AMD.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) new artificial intelligence chip has its first customer, which plans to build the most powerful AI supercomputer in Japan. The chipmaker is collaborating with Japan’s SoftBank Group to build an AI supercomputer, which will use chips from Nvidia’s new Blackwell platform, the companies announced on Wednesday at Nvidia’s AI Summit Japan. SoftBank will be the first to receive Nvidia’s DGX B200 systems to build the Nvidia DGX SuperPOD supercomputer. The supercomputer will feature Nvidia software and networking and will be used for SoftBank’s generative AI development. “With your support, we are creating the largest AI data center here in Japan,” SoftBank Group chief executive Masayoshi Son said. “We should provide this platform to many of those researchers, the students, the startups, ... so that they have a better access [to] much more compute.” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the supercomputer is only part of the collaboration between the chipmaker and the investment management company. SoftBank is also planning to build another supercomputer with Nvidia “to run extremely compute-intensive workloads.” The next supercomputer is based on Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell platform. “Japan has a long history of pioneering technological innovations with global impact,” Huang said, adding that with SoftBank’s investment in Nvidia’s technology, “Japan is leaping into the AI industrial revolution to become a global leader, driving a new era of growth across the telecommunications, transportation, robotics and healthcare industries in ways that will greatly benefit humankind in the age of AI.” Nvidia’s shares were up around 0.2% after the market opened on Wednesday morning, while SoftBank’s Japan-listed shares were down almost 2.9%.

Title: Bitcoin's wild election year ride in 3 charts

Bitcoin has been on a tear since Donald Trump’s election win, and it could be poised for even more gains. The leading cryptocurrency hit $93,000 on Wednesday, with an $100,000 milestone getting closer and closer. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet,” and Bitcoin, the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency, neared a record high of $90,000 on Tuesday. Trump has already appointed two pro-crypto candidates, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE (also a ticker symbol for Dogecoin, a meme token promoted by Musk). Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been soaring after last week’s election outcome, which has sparked investor confidence in digital assets. Over the past four years, Bitcoin has been extremely volatile, as shown by the 2022 collapse of the crypto giant FTX. The price fluctuates around economic events, regulatory actions, and market sentiment, which is why Trump’s appointments will be critical. We looked at Bitcoin’s volatility in 2024 and compared that with other assets and peers. A large volume of outflow occurred this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. The market rebalanced itself as other assets (such as Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin) gained popularity among investors. Bitcoin’s price quickly ticked up after fund approvals in late February and early March. During the first week of March, Bitcoin’s price continued to set records, crossing $73,000 at one point. On April 19, 2024, Bitcoin had its fourth and latest halving event, which reduced the reward for a mined block. Bitcoins are created by mining software and hardware at a specified rate, which splits in half every four years, slowing the number of coins created. On Sept. 18, 2024, after the Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin showed a sharp surge on the following day, rising to $63,000 from the $60,000 it was two days prior. The leading cryptocurrency saw another all-time high (of $76,943) after Trump was reelected before it closed at $75,904 (a 9% increase from $69,360) on Nov. 5, 2024. According to recent data from Coin Market Cap, in 2024, the global value of cryptocurrency rose to $2.87 trillion from roughly $1 billion in 2013. Bitcoin’s value surpasses the combined market caps of Ethereum, Tether, Solana, and BNB — bitcoin’s 60% dominance in the crypto market demonstrates higher investor confidence compared with its peers. On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s market cap briefly reached $1.78 trillion, making it the eighth-largest asset by market cap (surpassing silver), according to data retrieved from Companies Market Cap, a website providing data on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin trails gold, Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Saudi Aramco in global asset rankings. But despite already impressive year-to-date growth, Bitcoin would need to be 10 times its current level to match gold’s market cap.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA, Financial) set to release its Q3 numbers on November 20, is in the spotlight again, as analysts anticipate an earnings beat driven by its market-leading, AI-focused data center chips. Recently, Mizuho analysts raised their price target for Nvidia from $140 to $165, expressing optimism about the company's stronghold in the AI and data center segments. Analysts believe this position will secure demand for Nvidia's GPUs despite ongoing supply chain pressures. Currently, Nvidia commands over 95% of the AI accelerator market, leveraging this strategic advantage by supplying GPUs specifically tailored for AI applications. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Earnings per share (EPS) remain positively aligned with revenue expectations, as analysts project Nvidia's annual revenue growth to reach about $33.07 billion this quarter, marking an 82% increase year-over-year. Products such as the H100 and the upcoming Blackwell series have proven essential for data-intensive industries like cloud computing and generative AI, supporting Nvidia's nearly threefold stock price surge in 2024, which has elevated the company's valuation to almost $1.5 trillion. While Nvidia has established a significant presence in the Chinese market, recent U.S. export restrictions pose challenges. However, the company remains a prominent player in the AI hardware space, and its forthcoming earnings report is expected to reaffirm Nvidia's promising position within an AI-centric economy.

Amazon (AMZN) Web Services is looking to take on Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence chips with a new offer to AI researchers. The cloud computing unit of Amazon said on Tuesday that researchers who want to use its custom AI chip, Trainium, can get credits worth $110 million to use its cloud data centers as part of its Build on Trainium program. The company’s Trainium chip is used for training AI models, and is an in-house competitor to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Amazon is making up to 40,000 first-generation Trainium chips available for the program, which is focused on university-led research in generative AI, and counts researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley. Gadi Hutt, business development lead for AI chips at AWS, told Reuters that the company is taking a different strategy from Nvidia to get developers to use its chips, and is planning to publish Trainium’s instruction set architecture so customers can program the chip directly, instead of with software, which is what Nvidia’s chips need. But despite preparations to roll out the next-generation of its in-house AI chips, Amazon “is going nowhere,” until Nvidia’s CUDA software “is no longer the control point of AI training,” and the cloud giant “iterates much faster,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. Amazon will likely launch its in-house AI inferencing chip, Inferentia, at its re:Invent conference later this year, Windsor said, but he doubts “it will make much difference” to Nvidia’s dominance. “We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,” Dave Brown, vice president of compute and networking services at AWS, told the Financial Times. “But at the same time we think it’s healthy to have an alternative.” Windsor said Brown’s statement “is indicative of Nvidia’s market power, and all of its biggest customers are trying to reduce their dependence on it for training and inference and so far, they are having very little success.” Meanwhile, Amazon is discussing another multi-billion dollar investment in AI startup, Anthropic, The Information reported. Amazon is reportedly asking Anthropic, which develops AI models rivaling those of OpenAI, to use servers powered by its in-house custom chips.
