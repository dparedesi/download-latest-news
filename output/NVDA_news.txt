Title: EWCZ Marketing Shift Shows Early Wins: Can Growth Reignite Fast?

European Wax Center, Inc. EWCZ has made a decisive pivot to revamp its marketing engine and early signs point to meaningful traction. After implementing a modern advertising effectiveness platform in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, EWCZ reported sequential improvements in new guest trends compared with the same period two years ago. While the lift remains modest, this directional movement is critical for a brand that has struggled to grow traffic in recent quarters.At the core of this transformation is a push toward data-driven, digital-first marketing. With upgraded measurement tools now in place, EWCZ is able to link media impressions to in-center behavior, enabling smarter allocation of marketing dollars and a lower cost per acquisition. Creative and messaging tests are underway, with initial feedback suggesting the brand’s updated identity is resonating, especially among higher-value, more loyal guest segments.This effort goes beyond surface-level branding. Marketing execution is being tightly integrated with franchisee operations through new support tools, enhanced guest communication platforms like email and SMS, and the planned launch of a champion ad campaign during the peak summer season. These coordinated efforts aim to strengthen traffic recovery and unlock additional guest visits. While the initiative is still in early stages, management is confident that the company is gaining momentum and its sharpened marketing engine will drive meaningful traffic and sales growth in the second half of 2025. Coty Inc. COTY continues to evolve its marketing strategy by shifting resources toward high-ROI categories like mass fragrances while scaling back in lower-return color cosmetics. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Coty emphasized influencer-driven content and campaigns, such as its viral Rimmel UK push, to optimize digital reach with lower spend. However, inconsistent category demand and global channel fragmentation are still impacting Coty’s campaign efficiency.Another peer, Helen of Troy Limited HELE, is focusing on simplifying its marketing execution and prioritizing investments that deliver the highest returns. Helen of Troy is refining its paid media funnel, driving more earned media and reducing content costs across brands like Drybar and Curlsmith. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Helen of Troy reported traction in influencer-backed launches and direct-to-consumer growth, but tariff disruptions and pricing pressure continue to weigh on media performance. Shares of European Wax Center have gained 64.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 50.1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, EWCZ trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.61X, below the industry’s average of 27.7X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EWCZ’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 35.6% and 8.2%, respectively.

The incredible demand for data is fueling the market's next digital gold rush.

Shares of cryptocurrency-related firms Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) gained as bitcoin traded at an all-time high.

Full Content:
Jensen Huang’s wealth could soon overtake famed investor Warren Buffett’s, after Nvidia's rising stock earlier this week made the AI chipmaker the most valuable company in history. Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday became the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion when its stock briefly climbed above $163.93. The shares added another 0.8% Thursday to close just above $164, a record, leaving them 21% higher for 2025 and up roughly 1,400% over the past 5 years. Huang, Nvidia's CEO, owns about 3.5% of the AI boom's poster child. He's seen his net worth climb to an estimated $142 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, rising $2.47 billion yesterday alone, and swelling over $27 billion since the start of the year. This week’s gains have made Huang the 10th richest person in the world in Bloomberg’s ranking, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) CEO and "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett at an estimated $144 billion. At that level, it wouldn't take much for Huang's wealth to overtake Buffett's. Wall Street's analysts are largely bullish on Nvidia's potential for more gains, with a mean target near $175 compiled by Visible Alpha. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the stock's gains and Huang's net worth.

Title: AMD's Latest AI Chips Are on Par With Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, HSBC Says

The performance of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) latest AI chips is on par with those from Silicon Valley rival Nvidia's (NVDA), HSBC analysts said. In a note Thursday, HSBC analysts upgraded their rating on AMD to a “buy” from a “hold” and doubled their price target to $200, noting that AMD's latest series of chips can compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. AMD launched its Instinct MI350 Series GPUs last month, claiming the chips offered four times more computing power than its previous generation. “With the recent launch of the MI350 series, we were pleasantly surprised with the performance upgrades which imply that the MI350 series can compete with Nvidia latest-gen HGX B200 AI GPU,” HSBC analysts wrote. "Owing to the performance enhancements, the pricing premium is much higher than expected earlier which could help drive upside to earnings in 2025 and 2026." The analysts, led by Frank Lee, also wrote that there was further upside possible for AMD shares when the chipmaker launches its MI400 series next year, which could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform—scheduled for the second half of 2026. AMD unveiled the MI400 last month in an event hosted by CEO Lisa Su and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which has signed on as a customer for the next-gen chips. AMD shares are rising more than 4% to $144 in early Thursday trading, having gained around a fifth of their value this year. Shares in Nvidia, which briefly became the world’s most valuable company with an over $4 trillion market cap Wednesday, are little changed.

US Stock Market Today saw the Dow rise while the Nasdaq dipped as investors balanced Nvidia’s $4 trillion milestone with new Trump tariff threats. Nvidia (NVDA) led recent tech gains, but President Trump’s warning of 50% tariffs on Brazil and threats to other countries stirred fresh concerns. Delta Airlines (DAL) jumped 12% after strong Q2 earnings. Meanwhile, jobless claims dropped to 227,000, keeping hopes alive for a possible Fed rate cut. As AI momentum grows and global trade faces uncertainty, Wall Street is watching both Nvidia’s rise and Trump’s aggressive trade push very closely.

Title: The S&P is soaring, but fewer companies are setting record highs. Why that could be a red flag for the market
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/stocks-soaring-record-highs-market-breadth-red-flag/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:03:44Z

Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. The S&P 500 has been setting record highs in recent days, a dramatic turn from the market selloff back in April. But analysts are warning fortunes could change if overall market participation in the rally holds at the current rate. The new heights the S&P is reaching are being undermined by narrow company participation in those highs, according to a July 5 report from Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at wealth and investment management firm Oppenheimer & Co., and first reported by Bloomberg. Referred to as market breadth, analysts often try to see how many companies in a specific index or sector are participating in a rally to gauge how healthy it really is. That is important to track, says Wald, because narrow participation can mask underlying weakness in the market: Since 1972, the S&P 500 has posted below-average returns over the next one-, three-, six-, and 12-month periods when its all-time high coincides with fewer than 100 companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also hitting new highs, the analysis finds. At the last market high, 88 companies on the NYSE also hit a high. Indeed, big tech companies have been the drivers behind the recent market heights: Just five stocks—Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA)—are contributing over half of the S&P 500’s total return, according to an analysis from Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. It’s always a concern when just a few companies are responsible for most of the gains—because that means those gains could easily turn into losses depending on the strength of just a handful of companies. That’s what happened in mid-2023, when a Magnificent Seven–driven rally faded. And while the S&P 500 was less than 1% away from a new high at Wednesday’s close, the median S&P 500 stock was trading about 12% below a 52-week high, Turnquist finds. “Breadth is a little underwhelming,” he writes. “For context, over the last decade, the gap between the index and the median stock’s 52-week highs has averaged around 5%.” The good news, according to analysts, is that market breadth has been improving in recent weeks. The share of stocks in the S&P 500 above their 200-day moving average is 61%, just below the 10-year average of 62%, says Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII). Another positive sign for the market: All S&P 500 sectors have participated in the rally. Haverland says he expects to see more improvement in broader participation as investors get greater clarity on fiscal and trade policies. “Given the strong rally, however, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some consolidation in the coming months as the economy and earnings begin to digest the evolving trade policy,” Haverland says. “So, it may be a good time to rebalance portfolios.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels as AI Chip Giant Hits $4 Trillion Market Value

Nvidia (NVDA) shares hit a record high Wednesday as the AI investor favorite became the first company ever to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Nvidia shares have risen 88% from their early-April low and are up 20% since the start of the year, boosted by expectations that major technology companies will continue snapping up the chip giant's products as they build out their AI capabilities. Nvidia shares closed Wednesday's session nearly 2% higher at around $163, leaving the market value just shy of the milestone level it briefly surpassed early in the day. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since forming a bullish engulfing pattern in early April, Nvidia shares have trended sharply higher, with the price climbing back above the 50-week moving average (MA) in May on its way toward its recent highs. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, but remains below overbought levels, indicating the shares have more room to test higher prices before consolidating. However, it’s worth pointing out that trading volume has steadily declined during the stock’s move higher in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Let’s apply technical analysis to Nvidia’s chart to forecast how a longer-term uptrend in the stock may play out and also identify key support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast where Nvidia shares may be headed next by applying bars pattern analysis, a tool that analyzes prior trends to project how a future directional move may take shape. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the strong trending period from January to August 2023 and overlay them from the stock’s recent close above the 50-week MA. This projects an upside target of around $300 and indicates the move higher could last until late December this year if a similar trend emerges. We selected this prior trend as it also followed a bullish close above the 50-week SMA and has closely replicated the stock's current price action in recent weeks. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $130 level. The shares could find support in this area near the upward sloping 50-week MA and a trendline that connects a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to June last year. Finally, the bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level could see Nvidia shares fall to lower support around $97. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near the prominent March 2024 swing high, which sit just above major lows that formed on the chart in August latter that year and April this year.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose Wednesday as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization and President Trump released letters to more trading partners outlining tariff rates set to take effect on Aug. 1. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, closing just shy of a new record. The Dow ended the midweek session up 0.5%, while outperformance from the tech sector helped the Nasdaq climbed 0.9% to a record closing high. Shares of AES Corp. (AES) skyrocketed 19.8%, leading gains on the S&P 500 following reports that the power generator is exploring a sale. Several major infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit have been evaluating an acquisition of AES amid declines in its share price over the past few years, Bloomberg reported. AES generates energy from a variety of sources, including hydro, wind, and solar, and has signed agreements with multiple tech firms to provide renewable energy for data centers. Reports of a potential takeover bid also helped lift shares of engineering design software firm PTC Inc. (PTC), which surged 17.7%. Bloomberg indicated that rival Autodesk (ADSK), which competes with PTC in the computer-aided design and product lifecycle management markets, is evaluating a potential acquisition. Autodesk shares slipped 2.4%. Major cryptocurrencies moved higher, with the price of Bitcoin hitting a record high around $112,000 amid optimism about a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., advanced 5.4%, adding to a string of recent gains leaving the stock up over 50% since the start of the year. Newly released minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that policymakers believe tariff-related inflationary pressure will be moderate and still anticipate interest-rate cuts in 2025. The projection for potential Fed rate cuts and the likelihood of lower mortgage rates helped lift housing-related stocks. D.R. Horton (DHI) shares gained 5.4% Shares of fellow home builders Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), as well as shares of residential construction supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR), all added around 4.5%. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.7%, a day after the company reported it delivered 150 commercial jets in the second quarter, up from 92 in the year-ago period and ahead of analysts' forecasts. The aviation giant also topped expectations for quarterly deliveries of helicopters and jets in its defense segment. Shares of data analytics firm Fair Isaac (FICO) logged the weakest performance in the S&P 500 for the second straight session, dropping 6.5% Wednesday. The two-day slide came after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, indicated that lenders will be able to evaluate the creditworthiness of mortgage borrowers using the VantageScore system, a competitor to Fair Isaac's FICO credit scores. Hershey (HSY) shares fell 4.7% after the chocolate maker named a new CEO. The confectionery company announced that Kirk Tanner, who currently serves as the top executive for fast-food giant Wendy's (WEN), will take the helm at Hershey starting next month. Tanner is slated to replace retiring Hershey CEO Michele Buck. Rothschild & Co Redburn analysts downgraded Monster Beverage (MNST) stock to "neutral" from "buy," suggesting that tariffs on aluminum imports could weigh on the performance of the energy drink maker. Monster Beverage shares sank 3.3%.
