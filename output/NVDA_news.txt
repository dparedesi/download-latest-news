Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA-1.32%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company’s shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results, the company’s shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. “The market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,” Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said “Nvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,” and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple’s (AAPL+1.40%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY+0.39%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia’s technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.87%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell’s production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL+1.66%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.20%).

Bitcoin might be making headlines for hitting an all-time high after the U.S. presidential election, but an even more impressive success story is unfolding. While the world’s most popular cryptocurrency is nearing the $100,000 milestone, Nvidia NVDA has outperformed Bitcoin significantly over the past five years. Don't Miss: Bitcoin has had an incredible year. Since the 2024 presidential election, it has been on a rapid upward climb, recently hitting $93,434.36 and approaching the much-anticipated six-figure mark. Changing regulations, growing institutional interest and especially pro-crypto sentiments from the future U.S. leadership have all contributed to Bitcoin’s rise. Many analysts now expect it might hit $100,000 sooner rather than later and the enthusiasm is evident. Trending: ‘Scrolling Through UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. Valuation set to change next week but you can invest TODAY for just $0.25/share with a $1000 minimum. But while Bitcoin has been gaining attention, Nvidia’s stock has been outperforming it. On Nov. 14, Nvidia’s share price closed at $146.27, a staggering 2,768% increase over the previous five years. To put things in perspective, Bitcoin has increased by roughly 973% during that time, which is remarkable but still significantly less than Nvidia’s enormous growth. The tech sector now relies heavily on Nvidia. Their specialist chips have been in high demand as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a more important component of everything from data centers to consumer goods. The company has experienced exponential growth and its stock price has followed suit. See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Among Nvidia’s recent accomplishments is replacing Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This action emphasizes the continuous transition toward AI technology and firmly establishes Nvidia as a significant force in the tech sector. With a market cap of $3.43 trillion, Nvidia recently surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Analysts have remained bullish on Nvidia, citing its continued dominance in AI chips and the growth of AI technology overall. The company’s future looks bright, with analysts setting price targets that suggest even more upside potential for investors. Although Bitcoin’s ascent to its highest point in history is undoubtedly cause for celebration, Nvidia’s achievements over the last five years are truly remarkable. While both Nvidia and Bitcoin have provided investors with amazing profits, Nvidia has been one of the market leaders due to its steady expansion and rising product demand.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade — and the likes of Nvidia

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” Trump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He’s already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. During his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn’t say how much. The US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain—and America’s reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors. According to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips — central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. — came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a “major manufacturing disruption,” the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports. The CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike. Experts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump’s threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs. “Trump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that’s what he wants to be known for,” Newman told Yahoo Finance. But others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there’s a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs. If Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases. Newman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel’s (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers. For now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.

Title: Is AMD Stock Finally Better Than NVDA Stock After a 36% Decline?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-finally-better-nvda-142253161.html
Time Published: 2024-11-16T14:22:53Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has tumbled 36% from its 52-week high of $211 in March and trades around $135 as of writing. The decline has been driven by disappointing earnings and guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations. This dip has some investors wondering if now is the time to buy AMD on the cheap. However, a closer look at AMD's competitive position and growth prospects compared to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suggests the choice may not be so clear-cut. Before we get into why AMD stock declined, let's first take a glance at its Q3 results. However, the Q4 guidance disappointed analysts: Forecasted Q4 revenues between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, below the consensus estimate of $7.55 billion. This guidance miss caused a 13% stock drop over two trading days. These headwinds have soured market sentiment on AMD in the near term despite the company still growing revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q3. The question is whether the 36% pullback represents a buying opportunity for a quality company facing temporary issues or a sign of tougher times ahead. But first, let's look at what kind of competition AMD is facing. Nvidia is AMD's biggest competitor—we can all agree on that. That said, there are some differing opinions about how both companies could end up in the long run. Nvidia is focusing more on high-margin AI chips, whereas AMD is trying to undercut it and offer more value. I personally see it as something copied from AMD's playbook in the CPU market—where AMD slowly and methodically caught up to Intel—but it never managed to dominate it. Nvidia currently has an edge over AMD in the high-end GPU market. It has AI features like DLSS but, AMD offers very competitive performance for the price with its RX 7000 series, especially in the mid-range. Nvidia holds a clear lead with its GeForce RTX series—particularly the RTX 4090—in terms of raw gaming power and ray tracing capabilities. AMD’s Ryzen processors are highly competitive but do not challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU space. But again, this doesn't really matter much. Analysts care much more about dedicated AI products than anything related to gaming. Nvidia also leads here with its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which are widely adopted for large-scale AI training tasks. AMD’s Instinct MI300X is competitive but still lags behind Nvidia in terms of market share. Feature AMD Instinct MI300X Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU Memory Capacity 192GB HBM3 141GB HBM3e Memory Bandwidth 5.3TB/s 4.8TB/s Architecture AMD CDNA 3 Nvidia Hopper AI Performance (FP8) Up to 5,229 TFLOPS with sparsity Up to 3,958 TFLOPS with sparsity HPC Performance (FP64) Up to 81.72 TFLOPS Up to 34 TFLOPS Power Consumption (TDP) Up to 750W Up to 700W Target Use Case Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference AMD Instinct MI300X: The price of the AMD MI300X AI accelerator ranges between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the customer and volume of purchase. For instance, Microsoft reportedly pays around $10,000 per unit. Advantages: Higher memory capacity (192GB vs. Nvidia's 141GB). Solid for large-scale AI models like GPT-3 or PaLM. Greater memory bandwidth (5.3TB/s) allows faster data transfer for memory-intensive tasks. Superior peak theoretical performance in AI workloads, particularly in FP8 precision, making it highly efficient for large-scale generative AI tasks. Higher HPC performance in FP64 precision makes it more suitable for scientific simulations and other high-performance computing tasks. Disadvantages: Higher power consumption (750W vs. Nvidia’s 700W). But again, this can be offset by the lower cost of the chip itself. AMD’s ROCm software stack is still behind Nvidia’s CUDA in terms of maturity and optimization for AI workloads. This makes it harder for developers to switch from Nvidia’s established ecosystem. It also struggles with lower precision tasks like FP8. These are critical for AI training and inference. Nvidia’s H100 and H200 are better optimized here. Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU: The Nvidia H200 is priced significantly higher than the MI300X. It is estimated to cost around $30,000 to $40,000. Advantages: As I said, it has lower power consumption (700W). Strong inference performance, particularly in handling large language models like Llama2 with high throughput and efficiency. Better optimization for specific use cases like long input sequences and batch processing. Chatbots run a lot faster. Disadvantages: Lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the MI300X, which may limit its performance on extremely large models or memory-intensive tasks. Slightly lower peak theoretical performance in AI workloads compared to the MI300X. Feature/Aspect AMD Upcoming Products Nvidia Upcoming Products Key Consumer CPUs Ryzen X3D Processors GeForce RTX 50-Series (Blackwell) Expected Release Date January CES 2025 January-March CES/Q1-2025 Performance Expectations Significant gaming performance boost via X3D cache technology A major leap in ray tracing and CUDA core count; GDDR7 memory for higher bandwidth Key Data Center GPUs Instinct MI325X Blackwell-based AI GPUs Memory Bandwidth Up to 6TB/s (HBM3e) Expected improvements over Hopper architecture From what I can see: AMD’s MI325X will bring higher memory capacity and bandwidth, making it a strong contender against Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell-based GPUs. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem will probably still give it an edge. It'll cost much more, though. Blackwell B100 could cost $30,000 to $35,000, whereas MI325X is estimated to be around $15,000-$20,000. Nvidia's GB200 Superchip could be even more expensive around $60,000 to $70,000. AMD is "closing" the gap with its upcoming releases—especially in the data center segment—but Nvidia remains dominant across both consumer and enterprise markets right now. I really don't see it changing anytime soon. Why? Nvidia’s CUDA software ecosystem is a major reason customers stick with Nvidia GPUs. CUDA has become the industry standard for AI development. Switching from CUDA to AMD's ROCm involves significant effort and retraining of teams, and AMD will have to work overtime to convince customers to do that. Nvidia is growing faster and is more profitable than AMD. Last quarter (Q2), Nvidia grew revenue by 122.4% to $30 billion with a 55.3% net margin. AMD currently has an 11.31% net margin in Q3, and the gap will likely widen once Nvidia reports Q3 figures next week. Here's what you should know for now: Note: Q3 numbers for Nvidia are estimates, as per my research. Valuation is more subjective these days as AI has thrown a curveball into how Wall Street slaps a premium on certain companies. AMD is—and probably will be—valued less than Nvidia, both in terms of market cap and how the broader market sees it. Thus, AMD stock trading at 28 times forward earnings against Nvidia's 38 times forward earnings doesn't necessarily make it cheaper. In fact, I would argue that AMD fares worse here. A lower P/E ratio does not necessarily mean better value. Nvidia’s higher multiple is justified by its dominance in AI chips and its rapid revenue growth in this segment. Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion annually within five years. In contrast, AMD is still playing catch-up in AI—as we looked at before. What do analysts say? Nonetheless, I still don't think AMD is a "better" choice per se. Nvidia has been surprising analysts again and again in the past few quarters. Unless that changes in the coming quarter(s), I don't think AMD stock offers more value compared to NVDA stock. In terms of pure value—considering upside potential relative to the current price—AMD stock appears to offer more value than NVDA stock at this moment. NVDA stock remains an excellent long-term play for those focused on stability and leadership in AI, but—if you take price targets seriously—AMD stock provides a better risk-reward balance for investors willing to bet on its continued progress in catching up with Nvidia. In my opinion, you should hold both if you want exposure to AI, but NVDA stock should comprise more of that pie. While I acknowledge the potential of both AMD and NVDA as AI plays, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: SPLG: This Could Be an Ideal ETF for New Investors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market’s best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I’m bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.’s best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we’ll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a “low-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.” State Street also explains that SPLG is “one of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.” This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG’s holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which “represents approximately 80% of the US market.” This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out—rather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPLG’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. It’s worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG’s top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can’t necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you’ll find in today’s market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It’s hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG’s 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it’s still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500’s valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America’s strongest companies, and it’s difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I’m bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.

Title: xAI's value is set to double, joining Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX in reaching new heights

Two of Elon Musk’s private ventures are set to be worth a lot more, joining his sole public company in securing massive valuations. His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, CNBC reports, citing anonymous sources. Five billion dollars are expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East, while the remainder comes from domestic investors. The Financial Times previously reported that Musk had approached investors in Qatar and Saudi Arabia about backing the startup, which he launched last July as a competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI, as well as current investors like Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners. At the time, a $45 billion valuation had been floated. If the deal closes, it would more than double the $24 billion valuation xAI reached in May, when the company announced it had raised $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. The new funds are expected to go toward the acquisition of 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA-1.32%) chips, CNBC reports. xAI in October won approval to expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is expected to help train Tesla’s (TSLA+5.65%) AI tech, including Full Self-Driving. And SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company that plans to test a mega-rocket on Monday, is also looking to raise cash. The largest private company in the U.S. plans to launch a tender offer next month to sell existing shares at about $135 a pop, according to the Times, citing people who are knowledgeable about the discussions. With that reported offer, SpaceX would be valued at $250 billion, up from $210 billion earlier this year. It would also make it worth more than Bytedance, the company behind TikTok and the most valuable startup in the world. Both startups are likely to benefit from Musk’s tight-knit relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, who on Tuesday handed Musk an advisory board to recommend ways to slash regulations and federal spending. He’s already signaled that he will use that job to try and benefit his companies. On Friday, he agreed with investor Ron Baron’s comments that regulations should be changed so that companies don’t need to repeatedly get permits to launch rockets. He previously said he would work to streamline federal regulations for driverless vehicles, which Tesla is working on. Musk is widely expected to play a role in guiding the Trump administration’s AI initiatives. It’s easier to see what effect that relationship has on Tesla, given that it’s a public company. Since its CEO’s big bet on Trump paid off, the stock has boomed, reaching a $1 trillion valuation and surging above $300 per share for the first time since 2022. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its Q3 earnings after the bell on Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the AI trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia’s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter. Even if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results. That could have been a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time. Investors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is also facing an uncertain future, with Donald Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. The president-elect has also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Tech executives may be warming to President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House as clarity sparks optimism for more spending and dealmaking. Donald Trump pledged to "save TikTok," but a required divestment of the app is set to take effect the day before he moves into the Oval Office. A D.C. court case will determine what happens next. Tariffs on chips produced in Taiwan could hamstring the AI trade. The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue. The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers. In March, Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter before encountering delays, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft. Quarterly results from AI-leader Nvidia greet a stock market grappling with uncertainty about the Fed's interest rate plans and the impact of president-elect Donald Trump's potential policies. Nvidia has bested lofty Wall Street revenue expectations for the past eight quarters. Growth for the fourth quarter ending January - which will include sales of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips - is likely to slow further to 67.6%. After design flaws brought on delays in ramping up production of the new series of processors, investors are keen to know whether Nvidia will be able to deliver on the promised "several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue" in the January quarter. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was once a 'proud skeptic' of bitcoin, but now his money management giant is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a post-election surge in enthusiasm for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has in recent months asked suppliers to change the design of the server racks for its new Blackwell graphics processing unit due to an overheating problem, leading to worries about delays, the Information reported, citing company employees, customers and suppliers who weren’t identified.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. A hint of circumspection around NVIDIA appears to be creeping into the commentaries of the more discerning financial powerhouses that populate Wall Street. Consider the latest investment note from Jefferies, where the financial advisory firm adopts a markedly cautious tone vis-à-vis NVIDIA's prospects for 2025. A few weeks back, Morgan Stanley saw NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, and between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25. Fast-forward to this week, when Raymond James noted that it now saw NVIDIA shipping "around 100,000 Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which is likely at the lower end of investor expectations." The investment bank, however, was decidedly bullish on NVIDIA's 2025 prospects: "That said, we anticipate an acceleration in Blackwell ramps in 1H25, with strong demand extending through 2025." Today, it is the turn of analysts at Jefferies to expound on NVIDIA's near-term prospects. Jefferies Raises $NVDA PT to $185 from $150, Maintains Buy Rating Analyst Comments: "We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range. While expectations continue to creep higher, we believe the stock continues to work as we are in… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) November 15, 2024 To wit, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis begins by reiterating that he expects the high-flying maker of GPUs to repeat the story that has consistently played out over the past few quarters, replete "with a beat and raise in the $2B range." Curtis notes that Wall Street expects NVIDIA to earn at least $200 billion in revenue and $5 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, with some estimates reaching as high as $6 in EPS. The Jefferies analyst then notes: "While we are positive on unit upside, many of these estimates might be assuming overly aggressive ASPs, stemming from misconceptions that NVDA would sell entire racks for the GB200 NVL." Curtis expects NVIDIA to ship ~6 million GPUs in 2025, which is lower than most estimates on Wall Street: "Our roughly 6M GPU unit assumption implies DC revenue closer to $180-200B compared to buyside expectations in the $205-215B range." Despite his cautious tone, Curtis remains bullish on the GPU manufacturer's prospects, as evidenced by his reiteration of a 'Buy' rating for the stock with a target of $185 per share, up from an earlier peg at $150. "Blackwell is starting to ramp, with a 'few billion' this quarter and further growth as small volumes of the GB200 layer in next quarter. Hopper is still growing during this transition as prior deployments are filled out. We raise our estimates to reflect our updated expectations for the Blackwell ramp." NVIDIA shares are down ~2 percent at the time of writing. Year to date, the stock is up a whopping 200 percent.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+16.20%) hit a new 52-week low on Thursday morning as the AI-focused hardware company struggles with filing its quarterly report (Form 10-Q) for the period ending September 30. The San Jose-based company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the delay in a recent filing, saying it needs more time to select and engage a new accounting firm to review financial statements for fiscal 2024. Having already missed the deadline for its 2024 Form 10-K or annual report, Super Micro faces a potential Nasdaq delisting. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq (NDAQ+1.30%) to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. On Thursday morning, the company’s stock was trading at $18, down more than 7%. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 85%, erasing over $55 billion in value. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.32%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. More recently, the server company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The departure follows months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. After these events, Super Micro’s stock price experienced a significant decline, dropping 33% so far in 2024 and 35% over the past 12 months.

Title: 'Trees don’t grow to the sky': Nelson Peltz says the stock market's Trump 'euphoria' won't last

The stock market has been on a record-setting hot streak since Donald Trump won the White House last week. But billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz doesn’t think it will last. “No, trees don’t grow to the sky. Definitely not uninterrupted,” the Trian Partners founder said in an interview at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference. “There will be something that might upset it. I think you’ve got euphoria from the election.” Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump’s election win. These gains slowed Wednesday, with the Dow ending the day up just 0.11%, or about 47 points, the S&P 500 closing up 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling roughly 0.26%. Beyond the election-driven excitement, Peltz pointed to the high concentration of companies that currently drive the market. “You’ve got the S&P 500, and then you’ve got the S&P 20-25,” he said. “You’ve got two different markets. It’s the wrong name. You’ve got these 20 companies that are swinging the cat around the room. And then you’ve got these other companies.” That echoed observations from researchers at Goldman Sachs (GS-0.93%), who have warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While they attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, another major factor fueling uncertainty is an “extremely high level of market concentration,” particularly when it comes to the 10 largest mega-cap tech stocks, the strategists said. These top 10 companies — which include Apple (AAPL+1.40%), Microsoft (MSFT+0.20%), Amazon (AMZN-0.45%), Nvidia (NVDA-1.32%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.66%), and Meta (META+0.05%) — account for 36% of the overall index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 43%, compared with 36% for the index as a whole. Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.
