We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Why Tech Stocks Are Dropping Monday

Technology stocks struggled across the board Monday, including declines among Magnificent 7 firms and a big hit to quantum computing stocks. The S&P 500 technology sector fell about 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished 0.4% lower. The decline follows broad market struggles on Friday after labor market data for December came in hotter than expected, leading investors to scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Magnificent 7 were not spared, with Nvidia (NVDA) stock losing 2% and Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) shares declining about 1%. The only member of the group in the green was Tesla (TSLA), with shares up 2%. Nvidia's drop came even as the chipmaker announced a series of AI healthcare partnerships with Mayo Clinic, IQVIA Holdings (IQV), and Illumina (ILMN) on Monday, as the Biden administration proposed new rules on exporting AI chips. Nvidia called the new restrictions, meant to limit AI chip sales to certain countries, "misguided" in a blog post Monday. Shares of quantum computing companies continued to slide Monday after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed the lead of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with comments throwing cold water on the sector. In a Friday appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Zuckerberg said he believes quantum computing is "still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." That followed comments from Huang last week that "very useful quantum computers" are still 15 to 30 years away. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) shares plunged 32%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) lost close to 34%, IonQ (IONQ) fell 14%, and Quantum Computing (QUBT) dropped 27%. UPDATE—Jan. 13, 2025: This article has been updated to include additional information on proposed U.S. export rules and reflect more recent share price values.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are bleeding after Biden issued new AI rules

The stock market is in the red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunging more than 1% on Monday morning as new regulatory measures introduced by President Biden have severely impacted artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. These changes have raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related companies. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-2.03%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. Several AI-related stocks were also down on the Nasdaq, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.87%), Micron (MU+1.47%), and Palantir (PLTR+0.65%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Other tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq were also down Monday morning, with Apple (AAPL-0.68%), Meta (META-3.06%), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD+1.39%) down by 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. —Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: A Major Global Bank Expects NVIDIA To Earn $236 Billion From Datacenter GPUs In CY2025

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As the outgoing Biden administration significantly tightens the American noose around AI chips, narrowing NVIDIA's TAM in the process, HSBC is out today with a rare sobering take on the GPU maker's near-term prospects. To wit, HSBC analyst Frank Lee notes at the outset that NVIDIA will be "under increasing pressure to deliver an even stronger H2 FY26 ramp of its GB300/B300 platform" to counter the "potentially weaker H1 FY26 momentum." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's FY2026 roughly aligns with CY2025. Consequently, given the chipmaker's reduced sales-related momentum in the first half of 2025 vs. previously baked-in expectations, Lee now expects NVIDIA to sell ~35,000 NVL72-equivalent AI server racks in CY 2025 as opposed to HSBC's previous sales assumption of 41,500 AI racks, equating to lower full-year datacenter revenue estimate of just around $236 billion from an earlier estimation of $253 billion. Interestingly, Lee's bear-case scenario for NVIDIA entails full-year datacenter-related sales of "20K-25K NVL racks" and an EPS estimate of between $4.84 and $5.14, which "remains 8%/14% above consensus [estimate] of USD4.50." Lee goes on to note: "We lower our FY26 EPS estimates by 6% to reflect slower H1 FY26 Blackwell ramp." Given this reduced full-year EPS estimate, HSBC has trimmed its "target price [for NVIDIA shares] to USD185 (from USD195) based on an unchanged target FY26 PE of 32x." Of course, as stated earlier, HSBC's revisions are premised on a slower production ramp-up of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture GPUs. Nonetheless, do note that Jensen Huang recently declared at the CES 2025 that "Blackwell is in full production" now. $NVDA White House confirms global curbs on exports of AI chips by Nvidia and its peers; No restrictions apply to chip sales to 18 key allies and partners; Trump administration to decide how and whether to implement curbs - Six key mechanisms in the rule catalyze the… — TradeTheNews.com (@Trade_The_News) January 13, 2025 Meanwhile, as stated earlier, the outgoing Biden administration has now significantly tightened the US export controls around AI chips: The Biden Administration's "AI Diffusion" rule will stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership. Restricting access to mainstream computing risks derailing AI progress for industries at home and abroad. America’s strength lies in innovation and… — NVIDIA (@nvidia) January 13, 2025 Given the significant sales-related implications of this measure, it is hardly a surprise that NVIDIA has slammed Biden administration's AI diffusion rules by declaring that they will "stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership." The statement goes on to note that "this rule will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell on Monday as a continued selloff in tech stocks extended losses sparked by stronger-than-expected job reports. In the late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and 0.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a fresh high of 4.77%. Oil prices also surged 3.4%, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $79.2 per barrel, marking their highest levels since early October. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.53%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+1.23%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-0.27%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.03%) on Thursday. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the key inflation indicators, the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), this week. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-2.03%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Several AI-related stocks were also down, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.87%), Micron (MU+1.47%), and Palantir (PLTR+0.65%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (MRNA-3.07%) plunged more than 23% after the company slashed its sales guidance for the year. Moderna now projects 2025 revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a significant downgrade from its earlier forecast of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion posted in September. Shares of Lululemon (LULU-2.44%) surged 2.5% after the company raised its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected performance during the holiday season. The retailer now anticipates sales between $3.56 billion and $3.58 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion. The update is a positive development for investors, as the athletic apparel company has faced sluggish sales over the past year. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT-8.65%) spiked one week before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for his second term in office. Trump Media stock surged more than 21% on Monday afternoon, trading at $43.17 per share. That’s among the largest single-day jumps in the company’s share value since Trump won the presidential election. In the time since Nov. 5, shares of the company — which owns Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social — have climbed 21%. Despite stocks and cryptocurrencies rallying following Trump’s election victory, Trump Media shares, which had become something of a proxy for Trump’s election odds, had a surprisingly muted response to the election results. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 19-Year-Old Aspiring Investor Allocates $4K To High-Growth Stocks – Reddit Sparks Hot Debate On PLTR, RGTI and Tech Titans

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. When investing in high-growth stocks, names like Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and various tech companies are often mentioned. While Palantir is known for its data analytics platforms and is seen as the “new oil” by many investors, Rigetti is a leading company in quantum computing. It is developing technology that could revolutionize many industries, from pharmaceutics to cryptography. One such investor, at only 19 years old, has a clear vision for his financial future. With $3K to $4K or 33% of his portfolio, saved for high-growth buys, this young investor aims to hold these stocks for 10 to 15 years, but he wants to make an informed decision. Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. “I would like to dedicate $3K-$4K (around 33% of my portfolio) to purchasing some long-term individual stocks with high growth potential. I plan to leave money in these for the next 10 years,” he wrote. He’s drawn to several high-growth buys, including PLTR, RGTI, BBAI and a few other 3D printing stocks, but he’s unsure whether these are a good bet. Because he’s found himself at such a pivotal moment, he sought advice in Reddit’s r/investing community, mentioning that his goal is to secure growth over at least a decade – or more. As the Reddit community rallied to offer advice, the comment section became a debate field, with commenters disputing whether these high-risk, high-reward picks are right or whether a more diversified strategy would better serve the 19-year-old. See Also: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Let’s review the most common suggestions Redditors have given the young investor. Better Start With An Index Fund Like VOO, VTI or SPY Many commenters in the thread recommended the investor put his money into an index fund like VOO, SPY or VTI because they are simple to use and control, offer diversification and have growth potential in the long run. “The fact that you ask someone else what you should invest in means an index fund like VOO or SPY is right for you. This way, you don't have to analyze companies or do any of the tedious due diligence,” the very first comment reads. One Reddit member suggested that an index fund would be a better bet in almost all investing cases, mentioning VOO and VTI as his favorite. “In almost all cases, buying an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund ... a.k.a, a basket of stocks all owned under one ticket) is your best bet. VOO and VTI are my two favorites (VOO tracks the S&P 500, VTI tracks the total U.S. market),” the Redditor said. A third Redditor shared his investing experience, saying that he’s spent a lot of time researching and picking individual stocks, but only three beat VOO when he sold 15 of them. “I backtested my stocks and of the 15 or so stocks I sold, only three beat the S&P 500. If I had put all that money in VOO or VTI, I would have made more money than I did in individual stocks. Considering the time, stress and effort I put into individual stocks I came out way behind,” the Redditor’s comment reads. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Buy blue chip stocks for Long-Term Growth and Allocate a Smaller Portfolio Slot to Speculative Stocks Blue chip stocks like Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia were mentioned throughout the comments, as the Redditors who suggested them see these stocks as stable and profitable in the long run. “I'm about 80% S&P, 15% MSFT, 5% NVDA. Microsoft is one of those companies that rarely misses and I'll always hold it in my portfolio. Nvidia just makes sense to have for the next 5-10 years,” a comment says. Another commenter recommended Microsoft and Nvidia because, according to him, the companies holding them have solid fundamentals. “If you're thinking 10-15 years, consider looking into companies with solid fundamentals, like MSFT, NVDA or even some high-growth ETFs,” he says. Several Reddit members also suggested allocating a smaller portion of one’s portfolio to speculative stocks like RKLB, PLTR or RGTI. “RKLB will hit $100 a share by January 2026,” a comment reads. One Redditor recommended adding PLTR to the portfolio but emphasized how important diversification is. “PLTR could be a play but don't ignore the value of diversification,” he says. Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares dipped 3% in pre-trading on Monday, which would technically put them on the cusp of entering correction territory after a 10% drop from recent highs. The slide reveals bigger headwinds in the broader market, stemming from rising Treasury yields and innovative U.S. export restrictions on AI technologies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The Biden administration's new rules ban the export of AI tech to countries like Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the UAEwith China, Russia, and others still barred. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said preserving U.S. dominance in AI development and chip design was a key reason. Nvidia strongly criticized the restrictions, describing them as a 'regulatory morass' preventing American innovation. In a blog post, the vice president of the company's government affairs, Ned Finkle, accused the administration of stifling competition and risking losing the Edge on the nation's technology. Nvidia gets 40% of its revenue in the U.S. and 15% each from Taiwan and China. HSBC analyst Frank Lee also cut his price target to $185 a share but maintained a 'buy.' Lee said Nvidia's potential headwinds in the first half of its fiscal year, beginning February, may necessitate a stronger second half performance to meet expectations. Lee also lowered Nvidia's expected data centre revenue for the fiscal year to $236 billion from $253 billion and cut the company's sales estimates on the NVL 72 AI server racks to 220k. However, Lee said Nvidia still beats Wall Street consensus to beat earnings per share in the most likely bear case scenario. All those regulatory shifts and blunted analyst tips have made Nvidia generally caution about this near-term growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Nvidia can't wait for Trump as it bashes Biden's 'misguided' AI rules — and the stock falls

Time Published: 2025-01-13T13:17:48Z

Nvidia (NVDA-2.03%) on Monday quickly slammed newly released Biden administration rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” But Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Nvidia stock fell almost 3% in pre-market trading Monday. Under the new guidelines, 18 key U.S. allies and partners would not be affected by the restrictions. Companies that meet high security and trust standards set by the U.S., and are headquartered in countries that are considered close allies and partners, would have the chance to obtain “Universal Verified End User” (UVEU) status. This designation would allow them to locate parts of their computational power in allied countries, and buy up to 320,000 advanced GPUs over the next two years. Nvidia argued that these controls are an overreach, and would “do nothing to enhance U.S. security.” “Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” Finkle said. At the same time, Finkle praised the first Trump administration for laying “the foundation for America’s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security.” With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in exactly one week, Big Tech leaders from Google (GOOGL-1.17%) chief Sundar Pichai to Meta (META-3.06%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been cozying up to Trump. They’re hoping to benefit from favorable policies, more lax regulation, and a pro-innovation environment that they hope will allow them to go full steam ahead on their AI ambitions — and beyond. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang himself said last week week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led a slide in US stock futures on Monday, while the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest-rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation report. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) sank 0.8%, while those on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) tumbled 1.2%. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.3%. Stocks are shaping up for another rough session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report has rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading close to 4.8%, and the 30-year yield (^TYX) neared 5% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X) in particular coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Adding to the gloom, oil prices rose around 2% to their highest levels in five months after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry than expected, risking supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to over $81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) changed hands above $78. On the corporate front, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid as all the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps lost ground in the market turmoil. Europe's largest pension fund revealed that it sold its entire stake in Tesla over CEO Elon Musk's pay package. Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. In focus remains the rise in yields and now, the rise in energy prices. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, pre-market weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: TSMC fourth-quarter profit seen jumping 58% amid strong AI chip demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Faith Hung TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58% leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from U.S. government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of T$238.7 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers. "From the U.S. government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present," he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. "Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen," he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81% last year, compared with a 28.5% gain for the broader market.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Dell Technologies (DELL) Has ‘A Lot Of Upside’ If You Have Patience

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). Here is what he said: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) did not have a good quarter. It really was a disappointing quarter. I agree with people, even though I think the world of Michael Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). However, I think Dell’s second half will be much better. I do not think much of its first half. If you have the patience to own the stock here, I don’t think there’s a lot of downside, and I think there’s a lot of upside. However, we own other stocks in the portfolio that I think are better, even at this price. Do you know that I actually like Nvidia at 134 more than I like Dell? Just saying.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 7th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In these shaky times, investors can enhance their portfolio returns by adding stocks backed by solid financials and long-term growth opportunities. The investment thesis of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors as they pick the right stocks, as pros base their analysis on a strong understanding of the macro environment and company-specific factors. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their performance. We start with ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the third quarter of 2024, though gross bookings fell short of expectations. Recently, Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated a buy rating on Uber Technologies stock with a price target of $90. The analyst sees 2025 as a year of investment for UBER. While these investments could impact the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the near term, they are expected to fuel long-term growth. Based on his analysis, Lee expects Uber's growth investments to drive a compound annual growth rate of 16% in core gross bookings from FY23 to FY26, in line with the company's analyst-day target of mid- to high-teens growth. The analyst is confident that Uber's EBITDA growth is on track with its analyst-day target of high-30s to 40% CAGR. "Despite leaning into growth investments, economies of scale and increased efficiency should offset margin risks," said Lee. Additionally, Lee thinks that worries over the growth of the company's Mobility business seem overstated. The analyst expects FY25 gross bookings growth (forex neutral) in the high-teens, with the pace of deceleration moderating compared to the second half of 2024. Further, the analyst projects the gross bookings for Uber's Delivery business to remain in the mid-teens in FY25. This increase is expected to be supported by the growing adoption of new verticals while maintaining the food delivery market share. The analyst added that Mizuho's checks revealed that order frequency has reached another all-time high. Checks also indicate solid grocery adoption in the U.S., Canada and Mexico along with robust user penetration. Lee ranks No. 324 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Charts on TipRanks. We move to Datadog (DDOG), a company that offers cloud monitoring and security products. In November, the company announced better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter of 2024. On Jan. 6, Monness analyst Brian White reiterated a buy rating on Datadog stock with a price target of $155. The analyst thinks that the company has a more balanced approach toward the generative artificial intelligence trend, "avoiding the absurd claims propagated by many across the software complex." He noted that DDOG fared well compared to its peers in a challenging software backdrop in 2024, but added that it lagged behind other stocks in Monness' coverage universe. That said, White thinks that Datadog, and the broader industry, will start to see incremental activity over the next 12 to 18 months from the long-term boom in generative AI. Highlighting DDOG's outperformance compared to peers and its transparency with regard to its generative AI progress, the analyst noted that AI-native customers accounted for more than 6% of the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) in Q3 2024, up from over 4% in Q2 2024 and 2.5% in Q3 2023. White also highlighted some of the company's AI offerings, including LLM Observability and its gen AI assistant, Bits AI. Overall, the analyst is bullish on Datadog and thinks that the stock deserves a premium valuation compared to traditional software vendors due to its cloud-native platform, rapid growth and robust secular tailwinds in the observability space, as well as its new generative AI-led growth opportunities. White ranks No. 33 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Datadog Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's third stock pick. The company is considered one of the major beneficiaries of the generative AI wave and is experiencing stellar demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required to build and run AI models. Following a fireside chat with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $170. The analyst highlighted the CFO's assurance that the ramp-up in the production of the company's Blackwell platform is on track despite supply chain challenges, thanks to solid execution. Moreover, the company expects spending in the data center space to remain strong in calendar year 2025, supported by the Blackwell ramp-up and broad-based strength in demand. Further, Sur noted that management sees massive revenue growth opportunities, as it grabs a larger chunk of the $1 trillion-worth datacenter infrastructure installed base. Sur added that Nvidia expects to benefit from the shift to accelerated computing and growing demand for AI solutions. Management thinks that the company has a solid competitive advantage compared to ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) solutions due to several strengths, including ease of adoption and its comprehensive system solutions. Agreeing with this viewpoint, Sur said, "We believe that enterprise, vertical markets, and sovereign customers, will continue to prefer Nvidia-based solutions." Among the other key takeaways, Sur highlighted the rollout of next-generation gaming products and opportunities to expand beyond high-end gaming into markets like AI PCs. Sur ranks No. 35 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.9%.

Title: Jobs Report: Bond Yields Rise And Stocks Fall
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/12/jobs-report-bond-yields-rise-and-stocks-fall/
Time Published: 2025-01-12T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/01/11/index-funds-nope-were-doing-this-for-8-tech-dividends-and-upside/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T16:49:00Z

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Maybe NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Actually Goes To A New All-time High’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the market’s movements this week, focusing on the economic data that’s shaping the outlook. He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 During the episode, Cramer mentioned NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen’s speech on Monday and said: “Tech was strong all day today, you know, it's the leader again in part thanks to the buzz around Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang’s speech at CES on Monday night, Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia says Biden's new chip restrictions will 'harm' the economy and set the U.S. back
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-biden-chip-export-restrictions-set-us-back-trump-1851736935
Time Published: 2025-01-10T16:19:00Z

The Biden administration’s anticipated chip restrictions are being criticized by chip leader Nvidia (NVDA-2.03%). President Joe Biden’s last round of chip export controls would curb the sale of artificial intelligence chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies, Bloomberg reported. The rules, which are expected days before Biden leaves office, aim to support AI development among U.S. allies and promote U.S. standards globally, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. “The extreme ‘country cap’ policy will affect mainstream computers in countries around the world, doing nothing to promote national security but rather pushing the world to alternative technologies,” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement shared with Bloomberg. Finkle said the export controls are being “disguised as an anti-China move,” and that “[i]t makes no sense for the Biden White House to control everyday data-center computers and technology that is already in gaming PCs worldwide.” The new export controls will reportedly include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others, such as how much computing power a nation can receive. Companies in nations facing limits can reportedly bypass them and receive a higher cap with a validated end-user designation, which has security and human rights standards requirements set by the U.S. Countries deemed as adversaries will not be allowed to import semiconductors under the new rules. “This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,” Finkle said. “We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of US adversaries.” Meanwhile, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said earlier this week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Donald Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Nvidia’s shares were down by around 2.7% during Friday morning trading. Earlier in the week, Huang made several announcements about the chipmaker’s AI and robotics efforts during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Qualcomm (QCOM) came to CES 2025 on a mission to stake its claim as a major player in the PC market, and it proved it’s on its way with the release of its latest Snapdragon X chip. Available in mid-range laptops priced at roughly $600, the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run on-device AI applications and features without having to break the bank. But the company isn’t content with simply taking on the likes of AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) in the laptop space. It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers. And during an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months. “We want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot+ PC,” Amon said outside Qualcomm’s booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas. “We're not stopping here. We're just starting with [that] portfolio of products.” In particular, Amon said, Qualcomm is looking to expand into the high-performance PC graphics market, something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA). Qualcomm isn’t new to the PC space. The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops, but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps. But things are different this time around. Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive, with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and long-lasting batteries that you don’t find on AMD or Intel-powered systems. Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft (MSFT) to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intel’s chips can run on Qualcomm’s. So far, the companies are doing well enough at the task. In my own testing, Microsoft’s Snapdragon-powered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didn’t suffer from any app compatibility issues. Gaming, however, is a different story. Gamers require serious processing and graphics power, and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip, gamers, especially desktop gamers, will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles. It’s unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space; Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors. If it is looking to get into the dedicated graphics space, however, it would mean having to tangle with Nvidia, which controls a staggering 88% of the desktop graphics space alone, according to Tom’s Hardware. If taking on Nvidia isn’t enough, Qualcomm’s entire PC effort relies on stealing share from AMD and Intel, and that’s a tall task. According to Mercury Research, via Tom’s Hardware, Intel still controls some 76% of the PC market, but the company’s recent struggles related to its massive turnaround effort, including the ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger, give Qualcomm an opportunity to take market share from the chip behemoth. AMD isn’t resting on its laurels either. The company is similarly looking to capture greater market share from its archrival and is doing so by leaning heavily on AI PCs and gaming. For his part, Amon said Qualcomm’s growth has little to do with its competitor’s struggles and everything to do with its own efforts. “The incredible traction you're seeing right now is just because we develop a very competitive platform …independent of what our competitors were doing,” Amon said. “We're just starting. We’ll continue to have a roadmap of products and we will be pushing the boundaries of performance and battery life at every generation,” he added. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Rigetti Computing: An Egregiously Overvalued Quantum Computing Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/01/10/rigetti-computing-an-egregiously-overvalued-quantum-computing-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T14:57:55Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Rigetti Computing (RGTI) is at the forefront of the quantum computing industry and is also one of the only quantum computing companies with stock trading on the public market. Given the current broad media enthusiasm for quantum computing technologies following Google’s quantum Willow chip announcement, it is not surprising that Rigetti is being bought with speculative fervor. However, rational fundamentally-oriented value investors will have shrewdly avoided the stock at its recent price-to-sales ratio of around 250. Writer's note Within 24 hours of writing this thesis, Rigetti's stock price dropped by about 50%. The thesis below outlines the risks inherent in this speculative stock before the crash. CNBC attributed the crash to Jensen Huang, who stated that quantum computers at a commercially and industrially applicable scale are approximately 20 years away. This demonstrates that investing in Rigetti and other speculative quantum computing stocks at this time is somewhat reckless, even after such a significant price decline. Rigetti Computing Comp Performance Chart Operations & financials Rigetti Computing is one of the world’s forefront full-stack quantum computing companies. It specializes in superconducting qubit technology and hybrid quantum-classical systems. The company operates the industry’s first dedicated quantum device manufacturing facility. Rigetti’s business model is cleverly hinged on quantum computing-as-a-service (‘QCaaS’). The company offers cloud-based access to its quantum systems for enterprises, and this allows for stable recurring revenues from a subscription service. In addition to this, Rigetti also provides on-premises quantum systems for organizations, like national labs and academic institutions, that require localized infrastructure. The company’s revenue streams are further diversified through proprietary hardware and co-development projects with government agencies and industry leaders. It’s important to understand that the company is still emerging, and hence the investment carries financial risks (most notably through its net loss of $14.8 million as of the latest quarter, Q3 2024). In addition, as far as value investing goes, the stock appears to be egregiously overvalued, trading at an EV-to-revenues ratio of 455 and a price-to-sales ratio of 242 at the time of analysis. In my opinion, and as I will discuss in more detail in my valuation section below, despite the operational strengths and quantum macro-trend exposure that Rigetti stock offers, the valuation makes it currently an asset for speculation rather than serious value or growth investing. Rigetti stock is undeniably benefiting from the current increased commercial viability of quantum computing, where industries like artificial intelligence and cryptography are beginning to adopt quantum solutions. Quantum computing is now being viewed as the “next big thing” following the rise of AI, but sentiment appears to be both too soon and overextended, in my opinion. In addition, there are few publicly traded quantum computing companies, so Rigetti stock is benefiting from scarcity in the market. However, much of these sentiment trends are completely speculative, and it is much more shrewd to invest based on fundamentals for reliable annual returns over many years. Valuation Firstly, Rigetti stock should be scrutinized on its price-to-sales ratio, because as I mentioned, the company is not yet reporting a net income or free cash flow. Therefore, this is indeed one of the only reliable metrics at this time to assess the company’s present valuation with. Alongside it on the following chart, I have placed the company’s price-to-book ratio, which was 28 at the time of analysis. Rigetti Computing Valuation Chart There are very few companies trading at equivalent multiples, and the current sentiment is based on future growth potential, as it is possible that the company could achieve nearly a 50% annual revenue growth rate over the next three years. It certainly does not seem unreasonable that the company's revenues will scale to $50 million or more in the next five years. Based on other companies that achieve revenue growth rates of 50% per annum over three years, price-to-sales ratios rarely, if ever, go above 100. The best comparison here is Nvidia (NVDA), which has a 54.4% three-year annual revenue growth rate, but a much more reasonable price-to-sales ratio of 31. Indeed, at the peak of investor sentiment during the current AI boom, the stock’s price-to-sales ratio was approximately 45. This reaffirms that investing in Rigetti at a price-to-sales ratio of around 250 would be irrational for fundamentally-oriented investors. Rigetti Computing versus Nvidia PS Chart Counter-analysis Some speculative investors may say that Rigetti trades at a one-of-a-kind valuation, similar to the intangible value embedded in Tesla (TSLA) or Palantir (PLTR) stock. However, in the case of Rigetti, I consider this sentiment-based attitude to the stock as being reckless, as the company does not have a proven track record of sustained high sentiment related to intangible value, like an exceptional brand with Tesla. Moreover, Rigetti is valued at higher multiples compared to both Tesla and Palantir, so the “one-of-a-kind” argument loses credibility. This is the case even though Rigetti truly is a one-of-a-kind quantum computing company and one of the only publicly traded quantum computing stocks. Too much intangible value embedded in a stock price inevitably leads to an exhibition of irrationality from the market, which indicates a good time to sell, not buy shares. Investors who are looking at the company for its future earning potential will also likely be waiting for many years. That said, there is some credence to the notion that the stock could trade with exceptional goodwill once it proves stable earnings growth. However, for the foreseeable future of the next three or so years, a net loss appears inevitable as the company continues to scale and manage its technological leadership and further define its moat. Quantum computing industry Multiple estimates from leading research companies indicate that the quantum computing market will generate up to $1 trillion in economic value by 2035. 2030 is also likely to be a year of significant culmination for the quantum computing industry, revolutionizing logistics and supply chains, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and healthcare breakthroughs, artificial intelligence and machine learning efficiencies, financial services, cybersecurity, and many other high-value domains. The reason for these exceptional advancements is due to the fact that quantum computing can solve certain classes of problems far more efficiently than classical computers. This provides exponential computing power, providing revolutionary benefits to most industries reliant on computation for workflows and development. Indeed, the industry is going to be very popular and hence make for a great investment, but as this analysis of Rigetti shows, it is presently the wrong company to allocate capital to due to an already heavily overextended valuation. Other quantum computing investments There are a few other publicly traded quantum computing companies worth knowing about, other than leading Big Tech names. Namely, IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), Honeywell (HON), and emerging player Zapata (ZPTA). In the following chart I have removed Quantum Computing Inc. because its price-to-sales ratio is too high and therefore not meaningful, and I have removed Zapata because it is too small and its price-to-sales ratio was below 1 at the time of analysis, which is also not meaningful. Rigetti Computing Comparison PS Chart Rigetti has a one-year revenue growth rate of -36%, IonQ has a one-year revenue growth rate of 84%, D-Wave Quantum has a one-year revenue growth rate of -17%, and Honeywell has a one-year revenue growth rate of 6.3%. Rigetti has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 46%, IonQ has a future three-year consensus revenue growth rate estimate of 90%, D-Wave Quantum has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 54%, and Honeywell has a future three-year revenue growth rate estimate of 6.3%. Given the above data points, it appears reasonable to assess all three of the emerging players, Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave, as overvalued. However, of the three, D-Wave is somewhat more reasonably valued. Honeywell offers a good valuation but only moderate growth prospects. Conclusion I’m certainly bullish on the quantum computing industry in general. The field will likely be marked by high-growth companies revolutionizing workflow and industry development through exponentially faster computational power. However, as far as Rigetti goes, this industry-forefront quantum computing company is trading at an egregious valuation. In my opinion, a price-to-sales multiple of no more than 100 would be justified. Even then, a lot of intangible value would be attached to the stock, and I would much prefer to own it at a price-to-sales ratio of 50 or less. Therefore, I think it’s best to look at other investments on the market than Rigetti for now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure. Read more about the Fed's next policy move here. Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3.0% last month to 3.3% this month. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. But Nvidia (NVDA) shares came under pressure in the light of new chip export curbs expected to be announced by the White House soon. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 Vessels, insurers, two major oil companies and top Russian energy executives, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Trump's policy towards producer Iran. Teheran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of a crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump Administrations hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, said in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure.

Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

US stocks pulled back on Friday as cautious investors digested a final 2024 jobs report that blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up weekly losses. The December nonfarm-payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The bad news: That fed into a dilemma for some on Wall Street, which is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick Friday, nudging closer to 4.8%, at its highest levels since late 2023. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates.

Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 14% in morning trading. Delta (DAL) stock jumped 5% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue for the airline. But Nvidia (NVDA) shares came under pressure ahead of new chip export curbs expected to be announced by the White House soon. The AI chip leader criticized President Biden for the 11th hour rule changes, which is said were aimed at undercutting the incoming Trump administration.
