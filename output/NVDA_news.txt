The Nasdaq and other major indexes rebounded on Tuesday, recovering from the sharp sell-off triggered by DeepSeek’s crash, which had sent AI stocks tumbling. Nvidia, which plunged over 16% on Monday, regained more than 7% in the rebound. By the late afternoon, the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 408 points, or 2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, due on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Other major chip stocks also recovered a bit on Tuesday, including Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.24%). This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Tesla (TSLA-2.06%), Meta (META-0.06%), and Microsoft (MSFT-0.93%). Other than tech giants, Visa (V+0.34%), Mastercard (MA+0.41%), Novartis (NVS+1.05%), and others will also share their financial report cards. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: “DEEP-CRASH!”
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/deep-crash/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:05:49Z

By Greg Guenthner Posted January 28, 2025 The opening salvo of a hot artificial intelligence battle just dumped a bucket of cold water on the stock market. Big Tech spiraled lower to kick off the trading week after a Chinese AI firm called DeepSeek made huge waves in the industry. The ten-second version of this story is DeepSeek can do everything the other major AI firms can do, and more — all for a fraction of the cost, time, and equipment. As far as I can tell, there’s still plenty of arguing about the details of just how powerful this thing is by folks a lot smarter and more tech-savvy than me. The first rumblings of DeepSeek’s amazing achievements hit the market Friday, causing scattered selling in chip king Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). Shares ended the day down more than 3%. Not a great day — but also not the end of the world, as NVDA was able to post its second straight week of gains. But tech investors became noticeably nervous Sunday evening. By Monday morning, the DeepDeek fiasco sparked a mini-panic that ripped through the semiconductors and tech at large. The Nasdaq Composite gapped down nearly 3.5% to kick off the new trading week, while NVDA steadily dropped all morning, losing 17% by the closing bell. NVDA isn’t the only casualty of the DeepSeek crash. Speculators dumped their Big Tech shares, Bitcoin, and anything even remotely associated with the AI boom. The financial media wasted no time playing up the ugly numbers. Bloomberg was one of the first to note that the NVDA rout was the biggest in market history. “Nvidia shares tumbled as much as 18% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020,” Bloomberg reports. “In early afternoon trading in New York, the decline erased $560 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history.” What Bloomberg failed to note in its headline (and what is obvious from the above graph) is that due to its sheer size, NVDA’s notable drops during its incredible two-year rally make up 80% of the biggest single-day market-cap losses in history. The lesson: big numbers are big! Plus, these huge drops didn’t stop the stock from rallying more than 1,200% off its 2022 bear market lows. In case those gains fail to impress you, please note that yesterday’s drop shoved NVDA below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. I know it’s all too easy to get sucked into the bearish narrative after watching yesterday’s action unfold. But instead of focusing on the hundreds of billions in market cap that disappeared, I’m far more interested in what the rest of the market has to say in reaction to the NVDA situation. We’ve already witnessed the premarket panic, NVDA dropping double-digits, and other big tech names falling in sympathy. And while most market-watchers are hung up on hoping and praying NVDA catches a bid off these panic lows, we can use the confusion to our advantage. For starters, I’m keeping an eye on tech names that have little involvement in the AI ecosystem. While the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by more than 3% on Monday, more than 1,600 components finished the day in positive territory. Of these stocks, 150 gained more than 5%. Sharp declines in NVDA, ORCL, AVGO, MSFT, GOOG, and TSLA masked many of the positives happening under the surface. Then there are stocks outside of the tech sphere (Yes, they exist!)… Perhaps you’ve heard of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Big Board had a big day Monday. While everyone was sweating NVDA, the Dow posted a modest gain of 0.65%. But here’s the kicker: Every single stock in the Dow finished the day in the green. This looks more like a rotation than a selloff. While investors are ditching NVDA, they’re clearly putting money work elsewhere. Consumer staples, discretionary, and financials all managed to post gains yesterday. Finally, is the DeepSeek revelation a catalyst for a major trend reversal in China? The iShares China Large-cap ETF (FXI) posted a gain of almost 1% on Monday while the American tech sector faltered. At this point, we don’t know how much of the DeepSeek news is hype, panic, or somewhere in between. But investors are reacting favorably to Chinese names. Remember, these stocks have been a sloppy mess for years. They stopped going down as of early last year and have been trying to produce a steady uptrend ever since. We’ll see if this news is a game changer and leads to a bigger move higher in FXI. NVDA is not the stock market – no matter how much the financial media insists otherwise. Judging by Monday’s action, we’ll have little trouble finding viable trade ideas outside of the AI trainwreck. We might even get a reprieve from AI insanity thanks to a slew of tech earnings hitting later this week. TSLA, META, MSFT, IBM, and NOW report on Wednesday afternoon. AAPL and INTC follow on Thursday afternoon. If these aren’t enough distractions for you, we also have a Fed meeting and rate decision on Wednesday, GDP Thursday, and this morning’s durable orders to dissect. The market tends to have a short memory during busy trading periods. With a full slate scheduled this week, the NVDA strife could fall off the front page faster than you could imagine…

Title: Why Dell Technologies Stock Is Down 9% In A Day?

POLAND - 2025/01/11: In this photo illustration, a Dell logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) suffered a 9% stock drop on Monday, January 27, amid concerns sparked by DeepSeek’s affordable AI chatbot. This emerging technology has disrupted the industry, posing a significant threat to U.S. tech leaders and raising questions about the long-term viability of AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia’s stock(NASDAQ: NVDA) also felt the ripple effect, and plummeted 17% on the same day. See Why Is DeepSeek Sinking Nvidia Stock? Chinese AI DeepSeek has open-sourced its R1 model, which has been shown to outperform leading models from OpenAI and Meta in various benchmarks. What’s more, this breakthrough technology is not only freely available but also offers a cost-efficient solution that requires fewer computing resources, making it an attractive proposition for the industry. The situation could have particular significance for Dell’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI servers. Dell’s revenue streams are diversified, with roughly half derived from personal computers (PCs) sales and related products, while the remaining half comes from its robust infrastructure business, including servers, where the company holds a dominant market position. While Dell’s Q3 sales grew 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $24.4 billion, the company’s client solutions group experienced a 1% y-o-y decline in revenue to $12.1 billion. Consumer sales within this segment plummeted 18% y-o-y. However, Dell’s infrastructure business emerged as a bright spot, growing 34% y-o-y to $11.4 billion - with server and networking revenue surging 58% y-o-y to $7.4 billion. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Dell’s investment in AI servers is poised to drive substantial growth in its infrastructure business, as the AI server market is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2029. While AI-powered servers are typically low-margin, the sheer scale of the market presents a compelling growth opportunity. This growth will likely be complemented by increasing revenue from AI-optimized PC sales on the consumer side. While Dell’s revenues may be held back somewhat by the struggling PC segment, a substantial PC upgrade cycle is anticipated in 2025. The current economic climate and rising inflation have led to delayed tech upgrades. However, the availability of AI-enabled PCs, combined with the impending end of Windows 10 support in October 2025, may prompt consumers to upgrade their machines to leverage next-generation technologies and ensure ongoing security updates. With AI empowering both legitimate users and hackers, the need for enhanced protection may further incentivize upgrades. Dell’s stock valuation remains relatively modest, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, suggesting that the shares may still be undervalued. However, with the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned that the sales growth may be slower than anticipated. DELL stock has seen a 38% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -27% in 2022, 96% in 2023, and 53% in 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In conclusion, Dell’s attractive valuation, robust server and networking sales, and the impending PC refresh cycle position the company for potential outperformance, making it a compelling AI stock pick for 2025 and beyond. However, investors should exercise caution, as Dell’s business remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting industry trends.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

January 28, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz At the risk of repeating myself ad nauseam, this is as good a time as any to remind ourselves how little we know about the present and how completely unexpected events can be in the future. Our story so far: The technology sector has been booming for well over a decade. Software, mobile, e-tail, big data, LLM, and now AI have all been in growth mode. Expectations have been that this is the story of the next generation. Powerful semiconductors and sophisticated software will drive the demand for freestanding, energy-hungry data centers. That was upended by a scrappy China-based hedge fund that created an innovation to perform the functions of ChatGPT but with much less semiconductor horsepower needed. Free and Open Source, it created an order-of-magnitude decrease in costs. At one point yesterday markets were off 3-4%, NVIDIA was down almost 20%, and nearly a trillion dollars in market cap disappeared. As a short reminder, almost nobody had in their forecasts: 2020: Global pandemic that shut the world’s economy 2021: Inflation spikes, heads toward 9% 2022: Russia Invades Ukraine (February 24) 2023: Hamas surprise terror attack on Israel begins Gaza war (October 7) 2024: DeepSeek roils markets, challenges US advantages in AI If these surprises or random events were rarities, then perhaps we could dismiss them. Was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 a one-off? Pearl Harbor? JFK assassination? 9/11? The reality is that events that are wholly unexpected and feel random occur with shocking regularity. The years that DON’T have a big surprise are the outliers, not the shock years. I sure as hell did not see DeepSeek coming. Very few others did, either. But we should never expect any company to own their sector forever. In “How Not to Invest,” I wrote, “It may be hard to imagine today, but your great-grandkids would probably laugh at the reverence once shown for Starbucks, Facebook, Nvidia, Amazon, Google, and even Apple.” I was referring to Aswath Damodaran’s latest work, “The Corporate Life Cycle: Business, Investment, and Management Implications.,” where he compares all companies to people. They are born, go through growth spurts, mature, and eventually die. Even once-dominant firms like Intel, GE, or Cisco – all eventually lose a step and fade. As the chart above shows, NVDA goes through regular drawdowns — 66% in 2022-23. My colleague Callie Cox discussed this a week ago — only she was referring to Apple, not Nvidia.

Title: Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia’s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn’t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 "an excellent AI advancement" in a statement Monday. Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek’s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called “distillation” — in other words, it relied on Meta’s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model — the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” Sur wrote. Danley added: “Given Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.” Even so, DeepSeek “clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Title: DeepSeek is the 'Temu of AI,' analysts say

After traders sold off global technology stocks en masse Monday on news of a Chinese artificial intelligence competitor, some aren’t too concerned with DeepSeek’s seemingly meteoric rise. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a note Tuesday that they “view the DeepSeek fear across the tech world as in essence a ‘tech AI head fake’ that will be short lived as more details and analysis comes out about DeepSeek’s model and China resources.” The sell-off led to a $1 trillion loss in market capitalization, with much of that driven by heavy bleeding in the tech sector. Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) alone, which closed down 17% on Monday, shed $600 billion in market value — the largest single-day loss of any company in U.S. history. It ended the day with a share price of $118.68, bringing its market cap to $2.9 trillion. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading. Contracts for major U.S. indices were relatively flat early Tuesday. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.06%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.39%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. It also said it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. But Wedbush said it’s not worried about DeepSeek disrupting the planned $2 trillion in capital expenditures expected on AI in the coming years. “DeepSeek created an awesome LLM model (and credit to its software developers) however this Chinese AI small lab/LLM model is not bringing down the entire US tech ecosystem with it,” the analysts wrote. “Just like Temu was the ‘Amazon (AMZN-0.18%) model destroyer’ a few years ago... Amazon’s team adjusted and now look,” they said, referring it to the Chinese-origin e-commerce company that was feared to pose a major threat to competitors with its rock-bottom prices.

The release of DeepSeek-R1, a new open-source reasoning model from a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, should be a “wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry, President Donald Trump said. While speaking at a gathering of House Republican lawmakers on Monday night in Miami, Trump called for American tech companies to be “laser-focused” on competing with rivals like DeepSeek. “When you hear a DeepSeek, when you hear somebody — somebody come up with something, we always have the ideas. We’re always first,” Trump said at the event. “So, I would say that’s a positive... instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.” DeepSeek in December released a model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia. The release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks on Monday. DeepSeek also published a new set of AI models that the company said can outperform OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion Xl. DeepSeek’s Janus-Pro model family is published under a license that allows it to be used commercially without restrictions. Last week, Trump invited executives at OpenAI, Japanese investment bank SoftBank (SFTBY-1.59%), and software company Oracle (ORCL-1.58%) to the White House to announce Stargate, a joint venture that plans to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years. The project is planned to exclusively serve OpenAI, The Financial Times reported. Through a sweeping executive order, Trump has also revoked his predecessor’s 2023 executive order on AI safety and security, which was praised by a trade group representing U.S. tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN-0.18%) and Google (GOOGL-0.18%). He also signed a new order directing a group of White House tech and science officials to develop a new AI action plan within 180 days. “DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and top Trump advisor on cryptocurrency and AI, wrote on X. “I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” he added. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+4.55%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.67%), Micron (MU+0.28%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.24%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.06%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.39%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS+0.41%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT-0.93%), Amazon (AMZN-0.18%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL-0.18%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.

Title: AMD Expected To Lose Out On Taiwan Semi Tariffs; Melius Research Thinks NVIDIA Is Going To “Come For Them” Via Arm-based CPUs

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. DeepSeek's R1 AI model seems to have undermined the prevailing narrative around hyperscalers, wounding NVIDIA in the process. Even so, NVIDIA remains the strongest horse in the proverbial stable. As evidence, look no further than AMD, which has just received another downgrade, and that too on a vector wholly unrelated to the ongoing DeepSeek-related saga. Melius Downgrades $AMD to Hold from Buy, Cuts PT to $129 from $160, Cites Increased Pressure on Profit Pools Analyst comments: "We should have done this 10 months ago after an epic run for AMD (up over 40% at one point in 1Q24) - so we better have a reason. Believe it or not,… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 28, 2025 To wit, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes has now downgraded AMD to a 'Hold' rating, while conceding that he should have done so "10 months ago." Reitzes then points out that his AMD downgrade is wholly unrelated to the DeepSeek saga or the likely disappointing 2025 sales numbers for the MI300 GPU: "Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek. We cut numbers already on January 6th on GPUs, and the stock actually went up 3%, so a guide down on disappointing MI300 sales for 2025 is already expected." Instead, Reitzes asserts that Melius is now "more cautious on x86 server and PC over the long term for AMD," based on the conviction that "NVIDIA is going to increasingly 'come for them' in both markets [CPU and GPU] with their Arm-based CPUs that are optimized for accelerated PCs." The analyst goes on to note: "We are increasingly concerned that custom CPUs and Nvidia CPUs will cannibalize even more of the x86 server market long-term, even though AMD's current chip, Turin, is doing well." Accordingly, Melius Research has reduced its target for AMD shares from $160 to $129, implying an upside potential of ~12 percent relative to the stock's current pre-market price of $115.25. Bear in mind that HSBC recently noted that "AMD's AI GPU roadmap is less competitive than previously anticipated, limiting its penetration into the AI GPU market." Also, Wolfe Research noted in December 2024 that "AMD won’t be in a position to guide AI for CY25 – which will in itself drive concerns."

Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat Research, discussed Monday's market sell-off as an "overreaction". On CNBC, Lee said that the double-digit drawdown in NVIDIA (NVDA) is the biggest opportunity since the covid outbreak and will prove to be a great buying moment. "Markets don't like uncertainty, to me, it's an overreaction, and this overreaction will be a great opportunity for investors," Lee said. Lee's call seems good so far. After Nasdaq sold off 3% and NVIDIA dropped 17%, ,Nasdaq futures are up 1% while NVDA is 5% higher in pre-market trading. Monday's sell-off in NVDA was the biggest single-day market cap loss in history, with NVIDIA losing $465 billion in market cap, according to Bloomberg Data. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $97,500 on Monday and is already back above $103,000; but was as high as $105,000 before the news came out on the AI China's DeepSeek; this will be a level bulls will look to reclaim in the short-term. AI bitcoin miners also saw massive drawdowns, as much as 30%, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which is now slightly higher in pre-market. Lee also alludes to a healthy market structure in U.S. equities and notes that bitcoin has outperformed small caps and financials year to date. Wednesday turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting which is largely expected for the federal funds rate to be paused at the 4:25-4:50 rate. Lee says there is some uncertainty going into the meeting as markets are currently too hawkish and believe the market is putting too much emphasis on a potential rate hike in 2025.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The market reacted negatively to DeepSeek's open-source AI release through shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and U.S. tech stocks, but Wedbush analysts urge investors to see the dip as a chance to buy. DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, announced its R1 AI model development took two months to complete while spending less than $6 million. The model achieved explosive popularity and ascended to become Apple's App Store's number one position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. DeepSeek's R1 model threatens American giants OpenAI and Meta (META, Financial), yet Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismisses its impact on Nvidia and competitor performance. DeepSeek's remarkable achievements face multiple hurdles because of strict U.S. chip export regulations, according to Ives' assessment. DeepSeek's ability to contend against established U.S. tech infrastructure is in serious doubt, according to his analysis. Ives interprets the current decline in United States tech shares because he notices frequent market patterns that make these price levels attractive to investors. The extensive corporate investment by U.S. firms in AI across numerous applications, including robotics and autonomous mobility, makes it difficult for DeepSeek to create meaningful competition. The analyst confirmed Nvidia continues to reign as the dominant AI hardware market leader. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Short-term bitcoin (BTC) holders exited the market at a loss Monday as tumbling prices also saw derivative traders throw in the towel, leading to a significant decline in open futures bets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as addresses with a history of holding coins for less than 155 days, sent over 21,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to exchanges at a loss as the largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 4.7%, the most in two weeks, according to CoinDesk Indexes pricing. The transfer to exchanges, often a precursor to sales, was the second-biggest this month and may reflect that purchasers who'd bought when the price was near record highs around $108,000 toward the start of the year were spooked by the sudden slide back into the five digits. These addresses, owned by active traders, new entrants and weak hands, tend to be sensitive to price gyrations and often succumb when prices slide. BTC fell to under $98,000 as the weekend release of the Chinese startup DeepSeek challenged U.S. leadership in AI and technology. Other corners of the market also hinted at capitulation, often observed at local price bottoms. For instance, the perpetual funding rates for BTC flipped negative, a sign of stronger demand for bearish bets. That’s usually when bitcoin reaches a low such as on Jan. 13, when bitcoin dipped below $90,000 and Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind. The de-risking also happened on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, which saw the biggest notional drop in open interest (OI) alongside a double-digit slide in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Notional bitcoin OI fell a record $2.4 billion (17,000 in BTC terms), driving the basis lower, according to Glassnode data. U.S. listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a massive outflow of $457.6 million. A similar outflow occurred Jan. 13, according to Farside data.

Title: Big Retail is bringing out Big AI. Consumers might not even notice
URL: https://qz.com/nrf-2025-retail-big-show-ai-nvidia-amazon-google-1851740452

AI is no longer just a buzzword in retail. It’s a tool retailers are increasingly deploying to transform their business operations. Major retailers are partnering with tech giants such as Google, Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia as they explore AI’s potential. At least at the moment, the technology’s biggest impact is being felt on the supply side, not the point-of-sale. Carrie Tharp, Google Cloud’s vice president of global solutions and industries, said this month that AI’s evolution, particularly its shift from text-based applications to multi-modal tools that process images and videos, can increasingly boost retailers’ bottom lines. “What this looks like for businesses is brand new experiences,” she said at the National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail’s Big Show in New York. AI-driven marketing will gather deeper insights into consumer behavior to enhance personalization, Tharp said. But the real value, she said, is in improving internal processes. Take Home Depot (HD). The home improvement giant has tested pilot projects to create hyper-personalized experiences for customers. While there are customer-facing benefits, the focus remains largely operational. AI is streamlining operations and optimizing Home Depot’s supply chain — which ultimately leads to better experiences for customers, whether or not they see it. Tharp emphasized the importance of equipping store associates and corporate teams with AI tools to drive efficiency. AI is enhancing speed and reducing human error by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more critical decisions. AI’s growing value to retailers was evident during discussions at this month’s NRF Big Show. Companies are eager to optimize their core operations — meaning that’s where they’re most willing to spend money on AI. Tharp highlighted how Google’s (GOOGL) AI products are being integrated into the retail journey behind-the-scenes. Google’s advancements in search and consumer metrics allow retailers to track up to 10 touch points, or the interactions a customer makes with an item or product before they make a purchase decision. With AI-powered systems, retailers can predict what products will be in demand before they go out of stock “This has important implications for supply chain optimization and demand forecasting, two areas where AI capabilities can be especially useful,” Tharp said. Quantum AI is expected to take retail to even greater heights — although Tharp stressed the importance of mastering basic AI use cases first. “The priority is not only to enhance customer experiences,” she said, “but also make back-end operations more nimble and responsive to changing market conditions.” Fast food chains and discount retailers are also catching on. Greg Fiddes, Google’s director of Chrome enterprise software partnerships, shared at NRF’s Big Show how Chrome OS, a cloud-based operating system, is being used to streamline in-store operations at pizza giant Domino’s — a chain that touted using AI to make pizzas “before people ordered them” last year. Chrome OS now essentially runs interactive kiosks and digital signage across Domino’s more than 6,700 U.S. locations. Fiddes also noted the security AI provides. The software has never experienced a ransomware attack such as the one seen by CrowdStrike last year. This is crucial during peak times such as Super Bowl Sunday , when Domino’s delivers up to two million pizzas. “If you don’t make, take or bake the pizzas, you support those who do,” Michael Crumley, Domino’s manager of store technology, said of TK. “The ability to remotely manage and support devices is a major benefit, especially for a large retail chain with multiple locations.” Other big food chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s are using some form of AI, all with the goal of feeding customers faster. Retail giant Costco also relies on Chrome OS to manage operations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) is using AI and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to streamline operations. This is especially helpful in rural areas where connectivity can be challenging. The move could help Dollar Tree better handle operations as it considers a sale of its Family Dollar brand. Retailers are already using AI autopilot systems — in which AI handles routine tasks and humans intervene only in critical situations — said Andrew Sun, who heads Nvidia’s (NVDA) AI for retail division. “No one ever feels like you have enough time to do the very manual work, moving a box off a truck, making sure it’s unpacked, getting it onto the shelf at the right price, and serving the customer,” Sun said, noting that the shift could simplify a hard job in a high turnover industry. The AI chip maker is moving beyond gaming and entertainment to look at how AI can make more efficient use of labor and reduce human error – two key factors that can make or break a supply chain. The real win for the retail industry might not be in delivering more sophisticated customer experiences, but in building a stronger, more resilient infrastructure. For now, AI’s on the supply side, but as the tech matures, it will seep more substantially into every customer interaction and companies lagging behind in AI adoption may be in for a rude awakening. “While companies are making strides, the majority are still medium to slow followers in AI adoption,” said Jerry Sheldon, vice president at global research firm IHL Services. “This gap could lead to significant competitive advantages for early adopters and heavy investors.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Apple (AAPL-0.39%) is expected to release its fiscal first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. The company’s shares were up by 3.25% at the market close on Monday, while it reclaimed its title as the most valuable public company in the world from chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%), which suffered from the global tech sell-off sparked by China’s DeepSeek. The iPhone maker is expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter — an increase of more than 3% from the previous year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.65%). Apple is also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion. Earlier this month, Jefferies (JEF+0.77%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform,” citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” The company rolled out its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, in October, which “has yet to gain traction with consumers,” Jefferies analysts said. Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities. However, the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the older iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro both have three cameras. This potentially makes them more attractive options, especially if they have a lower price tag, Jefferies said. Shipments of the iPhone were also down by 4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, Jefferies noted, citing data from the International Data Corporation. The firm cut iPhone shipment growth expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) fell 33.78% overnight. The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) and T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) plunged 33.8% and 33.77% respectively. All three funds reported their largest loss in a single day, according to data from FactSet. Conversely, funds betting against Nvidia like the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) rose more than 33%. "This sell-off has been a difficult lesson for investors who have seen Nvidia as invincible and have taken aggressive bets on its growth without understanding the risks of single stock ETFs," said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The funds were designed to deliver twice the performance of Nvidia on a single-day basis. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which boasts the largest assets under management out of the three, saw AUM decline by $2.4 billion from its peak last November to $4.3 billion as of Monday, according to data provided by by Global X ETFS. The AUMs of T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) are currently hovering around $419 million and $497 million, respectively. "While these ETFs can magnify gains, they can also magnify losses and may not be appropriate for investors without a high risk tolerance," Islam told CNBC. Since their approval in 2022, single-stock ETFs have seen an explosion in popularity, with over 60 products available in the U.S. worth $18 billion in assets, data from Global X ETFs showed. Single-stock ETFs strive to deliver amplified returns compared to the underlying asset. "In other words, they're more volatile," said Morningstar. "It could be a matter of time before some of them implode depending on the intensity of market movements of individual stocks," said Marc Jocum, product and investment strategist at Global X ETFs. Nvidia lost almost $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in the U.S. The sell-off was triggered by fears of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek intensifying AI competition and calling into question America's dominance in the sector. Last week, DeepSeek launched R1, an open-source reasoning model that was claimed to have taken only two months and less than $6 million to build. It was reported that DeepSeek's reasoning model outperformed Open AI's latest o1 model in several third-party tests. Single-stock ETFs come with a huge risk, however, they can be useful trading tools when employed correctly, in particular for speculators, market watchers told CNBC. These ETFs are best suited for traders who want to take advantage of volatility to express a strong bullish or bearish view over a single day, said Islam. "While they're powerful tools for tactical day traders, they may not suit buy-and-hold long-term investors," warned Jocum. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Do you have $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket? If you're looking to invest it, you've come to the right place. Investing can be tricky. How much should you allocate to stocks and bonds? What if you need the money in five years? When should you come into the market if stocks are in the middle of a volatile period, like they seem to have entered on Monday? Ultimately, everyone has different goals and needs with their money, and deciding where to put it calls for individualized plans that account for timelines and how much potential losses one can stomach. If you're looking for ideas, we've got you covered. In recent weeks, we asked six experts where investors sitting on a chunk of money should consider putting their cash for the months and years ahead. Answers, which came before Monday's stock market sell-off, varied across asset classes and timelines and are listed below. Stock market valuations are high, leading some of Wall Street's biggest names to worry that the S&P 500 is a bubble ready to pop. While Ragan recognizes valuations are elevated, he still sees opportunities for investors to put cash to work. "We're still pretty comfortable adding funds to the market," Ragan told BI. "We still like the S&P 500 and large-cap US equities." Among large-cap companies, technology stocks have pushed the market higher, which is why Ragan believes it's important to maintain a dedicated allocation to tech. "On one hand, we're saying don't get too overweight there, but I think you still want to have exposure in that sector," Ragan said of tech. However, it's important to have diversified sector exposure, and Ragan sees opportunities in communication services, healthcare, and financials. Companies in these sectors tend to have low price-to-earnings-growth ratios, meaning they're undervalued relative to their earnings growth rate. These sectors will also benefit from increased deregulation under President Donald Trump, Ragan said. Dividend stocks are also trading at attractive valuations, he added. These stocks can benefit a portfolio by providing a steady income stream. With rising yields, Ragan also sees opportunities in fixed income, particularly in short-term bonds. Don't just stick with Treasurys, though. Ragan recommends adding corporate and municipal bonds to the mix. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these areas of the market include the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) and the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWY). On the heels of two stellar years for the stock market, Dobler said he's inclined to be a bit more defensive and cautious in the year ahead — especially if an investor is looking at a short-term time horizon. Price-multiple expansion won't come as easy, and investors are going to be looking for real earnings results, he said. Broadly speaking, that boils down to taking a three-part approach: allocating to fixed-income amid robust yields, so-called real assets as inflation stays elevated, and defensive parts of the stock market amid stretched valuations. Within the fixed-income category, Dobler likes investment-grade credit, Treasury inflation-protected securities, and municipal bonds. US money-market funds and high-yield savings accounts are also attractive options, he said. As for real assets, he said real estate, commodities, and infrastructure plays would get a boost as inflation remains sticky. And for defensive stocks, he said quality companies — those with stable and consistent earnings track records — would benefit if growth stocks start to hit trouble like they did in 2022. "The economy is slowing, financial conditions are tightening, and so it'll reward more of a defensive- and quality-focused strategy," Dobler said. Some examples of exchange-traded funds offering exposure to Dobler's ideas include the GMO US Quality ETF (QLTY), the VanEck Real Assets ETF (RAAX), and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). Quinzel believes that US exceptionalism will drive the stock market in 2025. Stocks have posted strong earnings, the US GDP is slated to grow at 2% to 3% this year, and secular tailwinds such as AI will provide a significant boost to the economy, he said. If you're looking to grow $10,000, "you certainly want to have diversified equities, and you certainly want to be focused on the US," Quinzel told BI. In this environment, investors shouldn't feel constrained by the 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, especially if you have a long time horizon, Quinzel said. It's perfectly OK to take advantage of the robust economy and allocate 80%, or even all, of your portfolio to equities, he said. For those who want to add more stability to their portfolios through fixed income, Quinzel recommends steering clear of high-yield bonds and going for Treasurys, corporate credit, and asset-backed securities. Quinzel also echoed Ragan's suggestion that investors branch out from the Magnificent Seven. He sees plenty of opportunities to play the Trump trade, such as financials and industrials. Both of these sectors will benefit from deregulation, M&A activity, onshoring, and defense spending, which Quinzel anticipates will increase under the new administration. Quinzel is also a fan of momentum and quality investing. "One great way to start investing is by simply utilizing funds that have those traits of momentum and quality because both of those can do really well in this kind of late cycle mode that we're in," he said. Funds that provide exposure to these market areas include the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). For those up for a more hands-on project, buying a multifamily property could be a good option, said Brian Rudderow, a real-estate investor and the CEO of HBR Colorado. While that may sound like it's outside the realm of possibility with just $10,000, Rudderow pointed to a Fannie Mae program launched in late 2023 that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy multifamily properties with just a 5% down payment. That's $10,000 for a $200,000 property. That's still relatively cheap for a multifamily property, let alone for a single-family home, in many areas around the US. But they do exist. "If you can find a lower-income city or a cheaper side of town, then you can do it with $10,000," Rudderow said. The monthly mortgage payment on a property at this price point would be around $2,500, Rudderow said. So, if you charged around $1,500 per unit, you could generate a positive cash flow of $500 a month. The stock market performed strongly in 2024, and Milan believes investors should be optimistic about its continued growth. There are plenty of opportunities for investors to put their cash to work. Industrials, financials, and energy are popular sectors for investors looking to take advantage of the Trump trade, Milan said. He also sees individual opportunities within those broad sectors. Investors should keep an eye on energy in particular. "For the first time in a number of years, there's a significant amount of value and strength in the energy sector," Milan said. If Trump's first term is any indicator of what's to come, Milan is bullish that the president's policies will be extremely beneficial for energy companies. Milan is less focused on big oil companies and more interested in natural gas. "Natural gas pipelines are showing extraordinary strength from a momentum standpoint right now," he said. His top picks include Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) and Energy Transfer (ET). Within financials, Milan is bullish on large private equity firms such as Blackstone (BX), Apollo Global Management (APO), and KKR & Co (KKR). "I think we're at the beginning stages of the next evolution within those types of firms, especially with regards to private credit," Milan said. These firms have poured a significant amount of resources into the private credit business, and Milan believes the asset class will take off in the coming years. Looking into the next 12 months, Roberts said he's increasingly leaning into the AI trade with the $2 billion portfolio he manages as infrastructure investment continues to grow. "It's coming, and it's coming fast," Roberts said. Part of that trade means investing in software and chips companies, like Twilio (TWLO), Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD), he said. Another piece of that play is in the energy companies that will provide the power to run data centers, he said. Some of his holdings include American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy (DUK), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and GE Vernova (GEV). But Roberts isn't blanketly bullish on AI-related stocks. Investors will start to put more of an emphasis on fundamentals, he said, and parts of the growth factor may start to get washed out in the year ahead. This may come amid a move into safer, dividend-providing stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), he said. "I think the unobvious trade is a rotation potentially from high-beta growth," Roberts said. "Dividend value has been really ignored over the last couple of years, and it's very out of favor." Jump to

(Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Even if you don't pay much attention to the stock market, chances are you've heard about Nvidia and its share price today. The company broke the record for the biggest one-day loss in value for a company on the US stock market. Nvidia's share price dropped by 17 per cent. This equated to a huge $US593 billion ($948 billion) loss in value — that's nearly $1 trillion in Australian currency. Here's what you need to know about the company everyone's taking about. Nvidia is a technology company that makes chips, systems and software that power things like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and graphics. It was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. At the time, the aim was to "bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets". In 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256, the world's first dedicated PC graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia, which goes by the a four-letter code NVDA on the stock market, became the world's most valuable company in June last year. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. Nvidia suffered a blow in September, when share prices dropped by 9.5 per cent — at the time, it was the deepest ever single-day decline in market value for a US company. That was until Monday, when Nvidia broke its own record. Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU. (Reuters: Robert Galbraith) As of the close of trade on the US stock market on January 27, it was $US118.42. Compare that to just a few weeks ago on January 6, when it was $US149.43 — its highest ever closing price. When you look at the share price across three months, you'll see it's a pretty significant dip: You can see the price taking a dive at the far right side of the graph. (Supplied: Nvidia) Because of the success of an AI chatbot called DeepSeek that creators claim only used cheaper versions of Nvidia chips. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 and touted its chatbot as being just as good as ChatGPT — but free. DeepSeek's AI assistant — a direct competitor to ChatGPT — has become the number one downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. Last week, a research paper was published about DeepSeek's new model called R1 that said it had advanced "reasoning" skills. The kicker was that this model was supposedly created using an earlier, less advanced versions of Nvidia chips. While this claim has been disputed, it still made people wonder how much of a threat this would pose to Nvidia. That's because the paper claimed DeepSeek only spent $US6 million to make it, which is really, really cheap compared to what other AI companies spend. For context, analysts estimate that big US companies will spend $US250 billion this year on AI infrastructure. So this lead people to question if Nvidia would keep making as much money as it had been. This set the wheels in motion for panic among investors, but it wasn't until DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple's app store on Monday that things really took off. Investors started selling their shares and, by the time the US stock market closed, close to $US600 billion had been wiped off the company's market capitalisation or "market cap" — which is the total value of a public company's stock currently held by all its shareholders. At closing, the price of one Nvidia share was $US24.20, or 17 per cent, lower. DeepSeek's success spooked investors. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Obviously losing nearly $US600 billion isn't ideal for any company. But it's worth noting that the stock price for the company is still pretty high. Have a look at this chart, showing the growth of Nvidia's share prices across the past year: The stock price is about double what it was this time last year. (Supplied: Nvidia) You'll see that, even with Monday's losses, it's still worth more than it was last January. On January 29 last year, it was only worth $US62.47 — a little more than half of what it's worth today. And now look at its growth since 2013: Nvidia's stock prices skyrocketed from 2023 — and it is still significantly higher than it was even when you take Monday's losses into account. (Supplied: Nvidia) Nvidia was worth just $US14.32 at the start of 2023, so it's still up by more than 700 per cent in less than two years. It has added more than $US100 to its share price in that time. ABC North America correspondent Carrington Clarke suggests we could be in for a waiting game to see how this pans out for Nvidia. "Often we see in markets when new information is being divested, the immediate concern is perhaps panic," he says. "The concern [is] that lofty expectations about future profits were not based on firm ground. "We [will] wait to see how this is processed. "Nvidia has a history of seeing major sell-offs and then rising again." Take, for example, the September drop — share prices got down to $US102.83 at its lowest point on September 6. A month later, the price had gone up to $US124.92.

Title: NVIDIA May Be Cooked

By Adam Sharp Posted January 27, 2025 On Friday evening, we covered DeepSeek R1, the Chinese AI breakthrough rattling NVIDIA and broader markets. I wrote the following: The implications are massive. In the long run, this could threaten not just American AI software companies, but also NVIDIA. If cutting-edge models can be trained with 5% of the previous hardware requirements, what does that mean for GPU sales going forward? When I wrote that Friday morning, I considered buying some puts on NVDA. But I didn’t pull the trigger. I thought we had more time. Of course, today I woke up to NVIDIA crashing in pre-market trading. It was down up to 13% before markets opened, and as I write this at around 11:00 am, NVDA shares are now down 15%. In full disclosure, I did buy a few NVDA puts just after markets opened today (even though they were about 3x more expensive than Friday). I have a short position here, so please take what I say about NVIDIA with a pinch of salt. I am now biased. I bought the NVDA puts as a hedge because of how incredibly important NVIDIA has become to the U.S. economy. NVIDIA’s market cap, still around $3 trillion as I write this, is about 10% of 2024 U.S. GDP. So NVDA’s current valuation equates it to roughly 10% of the value of all American goods and services produced over 12 months. That is borderline ludicrous. The company’s remarkable run has essentially carried markets higher over the past few years. Wall Street currently expects NVIDIA earnings to more than double from $1.30/share in 2024 to $2.95/share in 2025. By 2028, analysts expect the company to produce $6.15 in earnings per share. If Wall Street’s 2028 prediction comes true, at current prices NVIDIA would be trading at 20x earnings (a P/E of 20) in 3 years. That’s IF they can grow earnings by 4.7x over the next 36 months. So the pricing is getting ridiculous. The old adage “priced for perfection” fits this stock well. Yes, NVIDIA is a great company with a special founder/CEO. But it appears they may finally hit a peak for this cycle. And when these types of bubbles unravel, they tend to do so quickly. Hot stocks take the stairs up, and the elevator down. If this whole thing about China’s AI breakthrough proves to be overblown, I’ll be thrilled my puts expire worthless. The risk to markets is that significant. If the threat proves to be real, at least I’ll have some downside protection. Earlier this month, our own Jim Rickards warned about how fragile this market is in Positioned For a Historic Crash. Here’s an excerpt: “We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or another unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. Prepare now. Don’t be the last one to know.” The market may have found Jim’s “unexpected event”: China’s AI breakthroughs (see Friday’s article if you need a primer). Currently the S&P 500 is only down about 2% from its all-time highs. So if you do want to get prepared for a potential crash, there’s still time. But with NVIDIA down 15% as I write this, we could easily see a full-blown market panic develop. I sincerely hope it doesn’t happen, but I believe it’s time to prepare for a significant correction. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, cash is increasingly attractive. Disclosure: Author owns NVIDIA put options.

Title: What Silicon Valley Leaders Are Saying About China’s A.I. Miracle DeepSeek

The sudden arrival of breakthrough A.I. models from DeepSeek, a Chinese A.I. startup, has drawn ire, envy and admiration from Silicon Valley’s elite. Demonstrating capabilities that rival A.I. leaders like OpenAI, Meta (META) and Anthropic, DeepSeek’s models were developed with a fraction of the costs of their U.S. counterparts—a feat that has caught much of the tech industry by surprise. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. DeepSeek’s V3 model, released in December and followed by a new reasoning model earlier this month, was created with only 2,000 of Nvidia (NVDA)’s pricey graphics processing units (GPUs), according to the Hangzhou-based startup, which grew out of the hedge fund High-Flyer just last year. The company’s self-claimed ability to create advanced A.I. models on the cheap spooked investors betting on American A.I. giants. Nvidia shares tumbled 17 percent today (Jan. 27). Stocks of AMD, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) also fell. As some tech leaders question whether DeepSeek has more A.I. chips than it’s letting on, others advocate for tougher GPU export controls to prevent China from gaining an edge in the new technology. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s breakthrough a modern-day “Sputnik moment.” Microsoft’s Satya Nadella praised the company’s efficiency, and Meta’s chief A.I. scientist Yann LeCun lauded its decision to open source. One thing’s for sure: DeepSeek’s developments have got Silicon Valley talking. Here’s a look at what prominent tech figures are saying about the startup’s surprising success: Marc Andreessen, general partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, described DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model, released on Jan. 20, as A.I.’s “Sputnik moment” in a post on X yesterday (Jan. 26), referencing how the unexpected success of the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launch spurred the U.S. to step up its space efforts. DeepSeek-R1 “is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” added Andreessen, who praised the company’s decision to open source the model as “a profound gift to the world.” DeepSeek’s performance isn’t necessarily telling of China’s A.I. capabilities surpassing those of the U.S., according to Yann LeCun, but instead highlights the power of open source. “The correct reading is: ‘Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,'” the computer scientist said in a recent post on Meta’s Threads. LeCun additionally called the A.I. stock selloff in reaction to DeepSeek “woefully unjustified,” noting that much of the money tech companies spend on A.I. isn’t necessarily used to train models but to run them. For some tech leaders, DeepSeek’s breakthrough is a sign that the U.S. should continue cracking down on chip export controls. Dario Amodei recently told CNBC that he believes Chinese A.I. companies have more GPUs than expected, as many were able to procure vast amounts of the hardware before such restrictions were implemented. In the case of DeepSeek, “it’s been reported, at least, that they have a cluster of 50,000,” said Amodei. According to the Anthropic CEO, export controls must focus on preventing chip stockpiles from growing into the millions. “I think if the United States can’t lead in this technology, we’re going to be in a very bad place geopolitically,” Amodei told CNBC. To Marc Benioff, DeepSeek’s newfound popularity proves that data, not compute or models, will make the difference for tech companies going forward. “The real treasure of A.I. isn’t the [user interface] or the model—they’ve become commodities,” said Benioff in a post on X yesterday, where he noted that DeepSeek’s success was achieved without vast funds or Nvidia chips. “The true value lies in data and metadata, the oxygen fueling A.I.’s potential.” While speaking with CNBC in Davos earlier this month, Satya Nadella lauded the Chinese startup’s progress. “I think we should take the development out of China very, very seriously,” said Nadella, who described the DeepSeek models as “super impressive.” The CEO followed up on his comments today with an X post seemingly linking DeepSeek to “Jevons paradox,” an economic theory that posits heightened efficiency leads to resource consumption instead of reduction. “As A.I. gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of,” he said.

Title: Nvidia is doing damage control after DeepSeek's AI advance routed the stock

Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) addressed its tumbling stock on Monday by saying Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek will need more of its chips for new models. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 17% toward the end of the trading day on Monday after being down most of the day amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking.” According to the Hangzhou-based startup, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks — for a fraction of the cost and energy. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta (META-0.06%), and Google (GOOGL-0.18%) spending billions of dollars on its advanced chips. In December, DeepSeek released its V3 model, which it said used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Aside from prompting concerns about high AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success also calls into question U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering China. The Chinese firm trained and developed DeepSeek-V3 with Nvidia’s H800 chips, according to a technical report, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by OpenAI, Meta, and other U.S. competitors. Nvidia is allowed to sell the less-powerful version of its H100 chips to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions.

Title: Triple-Levered Nvidia Traders Are Gutpunched by 52% One-Day Loss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- As levered-up US investors sustained eye-popping losses in tech stocks and related ETFs on Monday, they could take some comfort from the fact that another batch of speculative traders across the Atlantic had it even worse. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials NYC Subway’s Most Dangerous Stations Are on Lexington Ave. Line Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding Amid a bruising global rout sparked by anxiety over the rise of China’s DeepSeek AI model, the London-listed Leverage Shares 3x NVIDIA ETP slumped 52%, wiping out more than half of its $172 million in assets before trading was halted on Monday. That eclipsed even twice-levered US single-stock funds like GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL), which was on course to drop a record 36% as of Monday afternoon. All types of leveraged products were caught in the global market rout caused by DeepSeek, which over the weekend rose to the top of Apple’s app store charts. Analysts said the model represents a serious competitor to products from American firms like OpenAI that are costlier to run. In Europe, investors have access to more highly-levered products, including some that offer five times the daily return of their underlying holdings. American traders, meanwhile, are limited to double-levered ETFs on single companies, though some triple-levered products exist. The drop in the Leverage Shares 3x product underscores how “concentration can cut both ways,” said Athanasios Psarofagis at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s been a good run, but sometimes you’ll be subject to these idiosyncratic days.” Exchange-traded products such as the ones tied to Nvidia use derivatives to amplify returns or provide inverse performance and have notoriously been caught up in previous market meltdowns. Still, retail investors have flocked to them, drawn in by the desire to chase big returns. Monday’s wipe-out might not dissuade such investors from trading them, Psarofagis added. “Investors are well aware of the risks.” And for investors who get the direction right, they can pay off. The Nvidia fund’s bearish equivalent, which delivers three-times the inverse of the stock’s performance, was up 58%. That product, though, is much smaller, having started the day with less than $6 million in assets. --With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova, Bailey Lipschultz and Sam Potter.

Title: Super Micro Computer Stock: Where Is It Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/super-micro-computer-smci-stock-2025-forecast/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T20:18:49Z

Super Micro Computer's low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock was a roller-coaster ride in 2024. The circumstances contributing to SMCI's rise and fall have angered some shareholders and polarized analysts, prompting ratings from sell to strong buy. So, what's next for Super Micro in 2025? Let's review the relevant factors to decide. Super Micro Computer makes and sells high-powered server and storage solutions. Like Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro has delivered consensus-beating performance on strong demand for its AI-capable hardware—including servers and liquid cooling systems. Energy-efficient liquid cooling systems are increasingly becoming must-haves for high-powered data centers. One of Super Micro's competitive advantages is its ability to deploy custom server solutions quickly. The company also has important AI computing partnerships with Nvidia and Fujitsu. In August 2024, short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting manipulation at Super Micro. This is the company's second reported accounting issue in recent history. In 2020, the SEC fined Super Micro and its former CFO for prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses. Super Micro's leadership team has denied the 2024 claims of accounting manipulation. However, the company has not filed financial statements with the SEC since reporting its March 31 quarterly results in May 2024. Failure to file on time is grounds for delisting by the Nasdaq. The company requested a filing extension to avoid delisting. Nasdaq has given Super Micro until Feb. 25 to report on the June and September quarters of 2024. The following financial review of Super Micro considers third and fourth-quarter earnings releases and a preliminary first-quarter report released in November 2024. This data may be unreliable if the Hindenburg allegations are partially or wholly true. Here is a look at SMCI by the numbers per the fiscal-year 2024 earnings release: According to the available financial statements, SMCI doubled annual revenue and grew diluted EPS by 60% in fiscal year 2024. CEO Charles Liang attributed the increases to "record demand of new AI infrastructures." Preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 show continued sales growth and a lower gross margin. Estimated results included first-quarter 2025 sales of $5.9 billion to $6 billion and gross margin of 13.3%. Sales and gross margin in the prior-year quarter were $2.12 billion and 16.7%, respectively. Through the calendar year 2023, Super Micro had minimal long-term debt. In 2024, the company sold $1.725 billion in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes carry 0% interest and are due in 2029. They can be redeemed early under certain conditions. The senior notes raised SMCI's debt-to-equity ratio from nearly zero to a reasonable 0.40. Super Micro has said it will use the proceeds to fund working capital and growth. With low debt and strong demand for its AI-capable server systems, Super Micro appears healthy financially. The company's extreme growth starting in 2022 did pressure cash flow and margins. But after the 2024 convertible notes issuance, Super Micro should have more than $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet. SMCI gained almost 8% in 2024, but it was a wild ride. After starting the year at about $28 per share, the stock eclipsed $115 in March. At that point, SMCI was one of the best growth stocks of the year. Then, the stock fell into the $50s after the company announced a sizable gross margin decline. The release of the Hindenburg Research report pushed the stock down further. SMCI stock was trading for $18 in late October, before climbing back to the $30s by year-end. Note that SMCI completed a 10-for-1 stock split in September 2024. The stock values shared are adjusted for that split. The fallout from the reports about alleged accounting irregularities will shape SMCI's near-term prospects. Other factors to watch include the demand for AI servers and innovation from competitors. Short sellers are in the business of convincing the public that certain stocks are worthless. Recognizing that short sellers benefit from stock price declines, many investors respond to short-seller claims with healthy skepticism. In the case of Super Micro, the Hindenburg Research report did prompt a sell-off as investors weighed corroborating evidence of misconduct. As noted, this isn't the first time SMCI has been accused of departing from accepted accounting practices. The prior accounting investigation prompted a temporary delisting by the Nasdaq and hefty fines from the SEC. There was no admission or denial of guilt by Super Micro at that time. The Hindenburg report alleges the company rehired executives who were fired in the wake of the first SEC investigation. The report also says the SMCI restarted unlawful revenue recognition practices months after settling with the SEC. Super Micro has denied the Hindenburg claims, calling them “false or inaccurate.” More concerning was the October 2024 resignation of SMCI's accounting firm Ernst & Young. The company's extended delay in publishing financial statements also sends a problematic message. How SMCI moves through this crisis is uncertain. In December, the CEO Liang expressed confidence that the stock would not be delisted. But Super Micro may have lost the trust of the investing public and that will take time to earn back—no matter how strong the business is. Research firm Gartner predicts data center systems spending will grow from $318 billion in 2024 to $367 billion in 2025. That equates to a 15.5% increase. The growth should benefit SMCI as a preferred provider of AI-capable server systems, storage and cooling systems. SMCI's accounting troubles present an opportunity for competitors. Super Micro is a market share leader in AI servers, a subset of the broader computer hardware segment. Large and small hardware providers would benefit from stealing the AI crown as Super Micro works to repair its reputation. Super Micro Computer competitors include Dell Technologies (DELL), HP (HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pure Storage (PSTG), Seagate Technology (STX), Logitech International (LOGI) and PAR Technology (PAR). For more AI investing ideas, see this best AI stocks for 2025. Analysts' average price target for SMCI is $62.03, which is 85% higher than the stock's current value of about $33. Two analysts have downgraded the stock since October. After those downgrades, the average rating is hold. The income statement outlook for SMCI remains promising. Analysts expect 70% revenue growth and 48% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. The percentages equate to revenue of $25 billion and EPS of $2.97. Analysts expect continued, slower growth in fiscal year 2026—an estimated increase of 20% to 25% for revenue and EPS. Strong business performance can inspire investors to overlook other problems. If Super Micro can meet its February filing deadline and avoid delisting, investors will likely refocus on the company's profit potential. Unfortunately, that potential could be less impressive than previously thought. With correct accounting treatment, SMCI may have slower revenue growth and higher margins. Legal fees and settlements may also have an impact. The company has a Justice Department investigation to manage, plus a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders in October. SMCI stock will probably be volatile throughout 2025. If the company can commit to lawful financial reporting without losing its competitive edge, 2026 will be a better year. Bottom Line Super Micro Computer was an AI success story less than a year ago. Today, the company is under a cloud, with a low stock price to prove it. The low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. After all, the company has ample cash on the balance sheet and steep demand for its products. But the risks, including the possibility of SMCI getting delisted, are considerable. For less risky investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. SMCI generates revenue by selling AI-capable computer hardware in the U.S. and internationally. Super Micro Computer has a reputation for innovation. The company is known for its ability to deploy custom, energy-efficient solutions quickly. A major risk of investing in SMCI is that the company gets delisted from the Nasdaq and must be traded over the counter (OTC). OTC stocks are less liquid and, often, considered less valuable than exchange-trade stocks.

Title: Stocks Get Crushed, Crypto Traders Liquidated for $983,889,444 As ChatGPT Rival DeepSeek Spooks Markets

A new Chinese advancement in artificial intelligence, DeepSeek, has left US markets feeling unsettled, triggering corrections in equities and crypto assets. DeepSeek, a startup based in Hangzhou, China, released its open-source large language model (LLM) app for free on Monday morning after reportedly spending only $5.58 million to develop and train it – a small fraction of the cost of ChatGPT, which hasn’t been publicly acknowledged by OpenAI but was estimated to be at least over $100 million. OpenAI is valued at $157 billion and recently pledged to raise $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the United States, but some say such numbers may be called into question given DeepSeek’s apparent cost-efficiency. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told BBC, “This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn’t necessarily been forefront, so it’s taken the market a little bit by surprise… So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that’s going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they’ve already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.” US tech billionaire and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, said that the release of DeepSeek R1 was China’s “Sputnik Moment,” referring to the Soviet Union beating the Americans to space with the first artificial Earth satellite. At time of writing, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) – a member of the “Magnificent 7” – plummeted on Monday and is now down 22% from its January high after losing over $400 billion from its market cap. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also down 1.75% and 3.19% respectively on the day. Bitcoin and digital assets followed a similar path. According to crypto data aggregator Coinglass, there have been over $975 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, mostly traders attempting to long Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins with leverage. BTC is trading at $99,789 at time of writing, and virtually all other digital assets are in the red on the day.

Title: AI-themed ETFs plunge in wake of DeepSeek news
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/ai-themed-etfs-plunge-wake-deepseek-news-4899766

Business Deepseek logo is seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration :Prices of exchange-traded funds with outsize exposure to Nvidia plunged on Monday in reaction to news that a Chinese startup has launched a powerful new artificial intelligence model. Technology market insiders like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have labeled the emergence of year-old DeepSeek's model a "Sputnik moment" for U.S. AI companies, most of whose share prices slid on news that downloads of DeepSeek already have overtaken those of U.S. rival ChatGPT on Apple's online app store. While Nvidia's share price traded about 17.3 per cent lower by midafternoon on Monday, prices of exchange-traded funds that offer leveraged exposure to the chipmaker plunged still further. The four ETFs that offer daily returns of double the gain in Nvidia were hit with the biggest decline, with the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF nosediving 34.5 per cent. Its leveraged inverse counterpart, which offers investors a gain of double any losses in Nvidia's stock, soared nearly 34 per cent. "These movements were to be expected, given what we saw happen with Nvidia," said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares. "We won't begin to get a sense of how much we're seeing in outflows or inflows until after the market is closed, though." Other leveraged ETFs with large Nvidia exposure made equally dramatic moves. The ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF, which targets a return double that of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index and has more than 40 per cent of its assets in Nvidia, tumbled 24.43 per cent by midday on Monday. Those ETF providers could not immediately be reached for comment. "Volatility is what the gamblers in single-stock ETFs are looking for," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "Those that have a bad experience now might shy away in future, but I’m sure they’ll be replaced by others." The leveraged ETFs, which carry relatively high fees of close to 1 per cent compared with about 0.4 per cent for a typical actively managed ETF, are the domain of retail traders and speculators, Armour added. But other ETFs were caught up in the selling, including many owned by institutions and retail investors with a longer investment time horizon. For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund traded down 5.25 per cent by midafternoon on Monday. Nvidia is the fund's second-largest holding, at nearly 15 per cent of the portfolio. The VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF lost about 10 per cent by midafternoon. It has a smaller exposure to Nvidia - only 3 per cent - but owns a wide variety of other AI stocks. "Innovation and competition emerging in something as early-stage and dynamic as AI is not that surprising," said Adam Patti, co-founder and CEO of VistaShares. "The market will have to sort itself out over the months and years, as to what works and what will prevail." The rapid growth of AI enthusiasm sent assets in the VistaShares ETF - launched only seven weeks ago - to more than $3 million by Friday, the firm said. The 2x GraniteShares Nvidia ETF - the largest of the leveraged funds - had $5.3 billion in assets as of Friday, according to data from VettaFi, accounting for about half of GraniteShares' total assets. "This has been a little painful, but interesting," said Evan Feagans, who manages the $74 million TCW Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has an 8.5 per cent weighting in Nvidia. "It has been a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of response to the DeepSeek news, but I think moves like this create opportunities. I'd expect to hear some of the biggest investors in AI reiterate their AI capital spending outlooks after they report earnings numbers." The selloff follows a week in which investors "aggressively" unloaded holdings in leveraged technology ETFs, said research firm EPFR in its weekly analysis. The firm said these ETFs recorded the second-largest weekly outflow on record, of $1.8 billion, with investors selling $400 million in leveraged Nvidia exposure alone. Data for any outflows from these and other AI-themed ETFs on Monday is not available until Tuesday.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? What to Know About the Chinese AI Startup That Spurred a Stock Selloff

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: The Alarming National Security Implications of DeepSeek and China’s A.I. Breakthrough

Wall Street started the week in a cold sweat thanks to DeepSeek, an obscure Chinese A.I. lab that just dropped a bombshell: a lightning-fast, budget-friendly large language model that’s shaking Silicon Valley to its core. The Hangzhou-based firm claims to have developed it over just two months at a cost under $6 million, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock dropped by more than 15 percent early Monday (Jan. 27). If this newcomer, established in mid-2023, can produce a reliable A.I. model that’s cheaper and faster than existing apps, that’s a stunning blow to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta (META). DeepSeek’s new A.I. app is already available online, including at Apple’s app store, and it’s moving fast. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The timing of this couldn’t be worse for American business, given President Donald Trump’s audacious announcement last week of a new $500 billion initiative termed Stargate AI, involving OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBF) and Oracle, which Trump promised would ensure “the future of technology” for America, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. Has that promising vision already evaporated? It’s too soon to say, but it’s now evident that America and China are in a tight race to harness the power of A.I. for the world. Comparisons to the U.S.-Soviet Cold War “space race” are impossible to miss, and many are comparing DeepSeek’s innovation to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, which shocked Americans with the realization that Moscow reached space before we did. Like Sputnik, DeepSeek’s claimed progress has alarming national security implications. While Wall Street is worried about valuations, the Pentagon is fretting over Chinese advances in A.I. that may give the People’s Liberation Army an edge in warfare. Given how top U.S. military leaders assess that our increasingly open conflict with Beijing may devolve into severe fighting during Trump’s second term, this is no idle threat. The Pentagon’s interest in A.I. and its military implications is hardly new. Five years ago, the Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was expanded to support warfighting plans, not just experiment with new technology. Last year, Craig Martell, the Pentagon’s top A.I. official, pronounced that new technology was revolutionizing how DoD does business. As Martell explained: “Imagine a world where combatant commanders can see everything they need to see to make strategic decisions … Imagine a world where those combatant commanders aren’t getting that information via PowerPoint or via emails from across the [organization] — the turnaround time for situational awareness shrinks from a day or two to ten minutes.” While the vaunted “fog of war” can never be fully lifted, A.I. promises to cut through the haze faster and with a precision never seen in the history of warfare. A.I. will reduce the information burden on military staff with speed and accuracy, enabling a tighter “decision loop” for U.S. generals and admirals. If DeepSeek’s innovation is all it’s being sold as, Beijing may have gained a decisive advantage that will enable the PLA to out-think and outmaneuver the U.S. military in any confrontation in the Western Pacific, most likely over Taiwan. The U.S. Intelligence Community is just as concerned about China’s A.I. progress. In recent years, America’s spy agencies have spent prodigious sums on determining how to harness A.I. to boost the speed and accuracy of intelligence assessments. A.I. can tamp down the “information firehose” that hampers the speedy analysis of complex intelligence problems, employing technology to make human assessments faster and more precise. Last summer, Lakshmi Raman, the Central Intelligence Agency’s top A.I. official, illuminated how this works. “Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage A.I. in order to help us to triage,” she explained, adding that A.I. was boosting CIA’s clandestine intelligence collection, not just analysis. The National Security Agency, too, has embraced A.I. with gusto, recognizing its game-changing potential for sifting through vast amounts of collected intelligence data to find the puzzle pieces of national security value. NSA is also protecting America from foreign A.I. programs, and the agency recently established the Artificial Intelligence Security Center. As NSA’s Director General Timothy Haugh stated, “When an enterprise runs A.I. systems, it opens up to new attack surfaces in the AI development lifecycle and A.I. abilities in model inference services. We need to secure and protect these systems from threats and buy down risks today.” That threat from foreign A.I. just got a boost with DeepSeek’s claimed progress. The good news here is that nobody’s certain of how real China’s A.I. progress actually is. Communists lie frequently. The Soviet success with Sputnik, boosted by Moscow’s putting Yuri Gagarin in space in 1961, a month before America did the same, proved illusory. The Soviet space program was hampered by quality and safety problems, and despite early Kremlin propaganda feats, America won the space race with the 1969 Moon landing. The bad news is that the clock’s ticking. John R.

Title: DeepSeek is limiting signups after a 'large-scale' cyberattack

Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:34:00Z

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.06%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.39%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+4.55%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.67%), Micron (MU+0.28%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.24%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is rattling markets. Here's what to know

Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:15:00Z

A Chinese artificial intelligence startup is rattling Silicon Valley and Wall Street after it demonstrated AI models on par with OpenAI’s — for a fraction of the cost and energy. At just over a year old, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released results for its latest open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week. The models showed a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks. In December, DeepSeek released a different model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%). The release of DeepSeek-R1 has sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Here’s what to know about DeepSeek and its AI models. The Chinese AI startup was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of Chinese quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer Capital Management. DeepSeek was reportedly formed out of High-Flyer’s AI research unit to focus on developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which is when AI reaches human-level intelligence. DeepSeek develops open-source models, which means developers have access to and can work on its software. DeepSeek introduced its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, last week. DeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained by large-scale reinforcement learning and without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek said. The model “demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities,” but has challenges with “poor readability” and mixing language, according to the startup. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, has surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.39%) App Store downloads, while the DeepSeek site is experiencing outages from an influx of new users. The startup announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, prompting a temporary limit on registrations. The chatbot was powered by DeepSeek-V3, which DeepSeek said performed comparably with Meta’s (META-0.06%) Llama 3.1 and OpenAI’s 4o at its release in December. Unlike ChatGPT and its other chatbot competitors, DeepSeek explains its “reasoning” before responding to inquiries. However, the Chinese-developed chatbot does not directly answer prompts about politically sensitive topics such as President Xi Jinping or Taiwan. According to DeepSeek, R1 performed comparably with OpenAI’s and Meta’s models on leading benchmarks such as the AIME 2024, which tests mathematics, and the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) which evaluates general knowledge. On the community-driven Chatbot Arena leaderboard, DeepSeek-R1 comes in under Google’s (GOOGL-0.18%) Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model and ChatGPT-4o. DeepSeek-V3, meanwhile, fell just below OpenAI’s o1-preview and full o1 models. Meta, which also develops open-source models, is reportedly concerned that the next version of its flagship Llama will fall behind DeepSeek’s models. Specialized groups of researchers at Meta are looking into DeepSeek’s models for ways to improve the next Llama model, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google spending billions of dollars on its GPUs. In a technical report for its V3 model, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Last week, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025. He added that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Meanwhile, OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY-1.59%), and Oracle (ORCL-1.58%) recently announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan with the Trump administration called Stargate. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Aside from prompting questions about AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success challenges U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country. According to its technical report, DeepSeek used Nvidia’s H800 chips for its V3 model, which are a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100s that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. Before leaving office earlier this month, the Biden administration introduced even more measures focused on keeping AI chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. The U.S. also published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia, to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others.

Title: Bitcoin's DeepSeek-Triggered Selloff Is a Buy the Dip Opportunity, Analysts Say

Crypto assets saw a panicky decline overnight alongside a Nvidia-led tech stock plunge on DeepSeek's more efficient artificial intelligence model. With bitcoin (BTC) at one point sliding from a Sunday high of $105,000 to below $98,000 before bouncing back to its current level just below $100,000, some analysts warned this could be the start of an even deeper pullback. Among those taking the other side of that trade is Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Buy the dip," he said in a Monday morning report. Kendrick one week ago warned of a potential 10%-20% correction thanks to markets having priced in overzealous expectations of Trump's crypto executive order and strategic reserve. The overnight selloff, he argued, likely took care of much of this. While there might be some more pain ahead this week with U.S. big tech companies reporting earnings this week and the Federal Reserve's January meeting results Wednesday, Kendrick took note of the rapid decline in U.S. Treasury yields — the 10-year note yield now nearing 4.5% — as signaling much of the downward move is done. Despite there not being much near-term price boost from the Trump administration's digital asset actions, the benefits should ripple through the sector over the next weeks and months through boosted institutional asset flows. LondonCryptoClub analysts hit a similar note, seeing the crypto selloff as a knee-jerk reaction to a headline event. "The Deepseek FUD [fear, uncertainty, doubt] is a classic shoot first, ask questions later," LondonCryptoClub analysts said. "Flushes like these amidst a still constructive fundamental macro story that typically mark local lows in a bull trend." "Be careful today as a broad derisking can be very mechanical and indiscriminate," they added. "But this is very much a BTFD [buy the **** dip] market still." Bitcoin at press time was trading down more than 4% over the past 24 hours at $99,800. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was lower by 3%, led by 15% decline for Nvidia (NVDA).

Nvidia (NVDA-5.98%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL-0.39%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.93%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+4.55%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.67%), Micron (MU+0.28%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.24%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.06%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm. It’s called DeepSeek R1, and it’s rattling nerves on Wall Street. The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “AI’s Sputnik moment”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That’s even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips. The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights. Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research. His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development. Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention. Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported. But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation. And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it. The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times. AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America’s most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. So the notion that similar capabilities as America’s most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry’s understanding of how much investment is needed in AI. The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments. Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet. The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology. But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions. DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will win. That’s an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy. Wall Street was alarmed by the development. US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants. The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. The company notably didn’t say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn’t spend billions of dollars.) It’s also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.” Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Title: Why DeepSeek Is Sinking Nvidia Stock?

HANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals. Now DeepSeek’s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force — amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia’s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What’s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock? This cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens — significantly undercutting OpenAI’s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company’s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek’s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. That being said, we believe that DeepSeek’s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek’s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia’s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%. If the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models. Now the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We see a possibility that the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia. Moreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure. Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully reflect these risks. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, roughly 35% below the current market price.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger Stocks were down sharply on Monday on concern about an artificial intelligence stock bubble popping because of the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek that possibly made a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 122 points, or 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite shed 2.7%, and the S&P 500 slid 1.6%. Last week, DeepSeek released an open source AI model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s in several tests. The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai 1 posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Red Badger Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? 2 posted on 01/27/2025 7:11:18 AM PST by Paladin2 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Red Badger dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s.

The Nasdaq Composite shed 2.7%, and the S&P 500 slid 1.6%. Last week, DeepSeek released an open source AI model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s in several tests. The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai 1 posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Red Badger Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? 2 posted on 01/27/2025 7:11:18 AM PST by Paladin2 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Red Badger dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s.

Posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger Key Points * U.S. technology firms like Nvidia plunged, as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in AI and America’s lead in the sector, triggering a global sell-off. * DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. * These developments have bolstered questions about the large amounts of money big tech companies have been investing in artificial intelligence models and data centers. ====================================================================== Nvidia and other U.S. technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America’s leadership in the sector. Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Title: Has DeepSeek Ended The AI Run Led By NVIDIA? A Deep Dive Into What’s Next For The Magnificent Seven
URL: https://wccftech.com/has-deepseek-ended-the-ai-run-led-by-nvidia/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:45:42Z
Full Content:
Well, it's not a great day for AI investors, and NVIDIA in particular, since the Chinese firm DeepSeek has managed to disrupt industry norms with its newest R1 AI model, which is said to change the concept of model training and the resources involved behind it. If you have been living under the rocks or still haven't understood why the "AI markets" are panicking right now, this post is definitely for you. So, China has managed to launch an AI model that is said to be trained using significantly lower financial resources, which we'll talk about later, and this has stirred the debate on the fact whether the "AI supercycle" witnessed in the past year is overhyped or rather not worth the money poured into it. DeepSeek R1 has managed to compete with some of the top-end LLMs out there, with an "alleged" training cost that might seem shocking. Let's start with what DeepSeek R1 is, and how it differs from the others. The R1 is a one-of-a-kind open-source LLM model that is said to primarily rely on an implementation that hasn't been done by any other alternative out there. While we won't go much into technicals since that would make the post boring, but the important point to note here is that the R1 relies on a "Chain of Thought" process, which means that when a prompt is given to the AI model, it demonstrates the steps and conclusions it has made to reach to the final answer, that way, users can diagnose the part where the LLM had made a mistake in the first place. Another interesting fact about DeepSeek R1 is the use of "Reinforcement Learning" to achieve an outcome. It is a type of machine learning where the model interacts with the environment to make its decision through a "reward-based process." When a desirable outcome is reached, the model makes sure to opt for those where the reward is maximum, and in this way, it is certain that the desirable conclusion will be achieved. Whereas, with GPT's o1, the core focus is on supervised learning methods, which involve training the model on massive datasets of text and code, which ultimately requires more financial resources. Speaking of financial resources, there's a lot of misconception in the markets around DeepSeek's training costs, since the rumored "$5.6 million" figure is just the cost of running the final model, not the total cost. Since China is restricted from accessing cutting-edge AI computing hardware, it won't be wise of DeepSeek to reveal its AI arsenal, which is why the expert perception is that DeepSeek has power equivalent to its competitors, but undisclosed for now. $NVDA - MUSK SUGGESTS DEEPSEEK 'OBVIOUSLY' HAS MORE NVIDIA GPUS THAN CLAIMED Elon Musk and Alexandr Wang suggest DeepSeek has about 50,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, not the 10,000 A100s they claim, due to U.S. export controls. Musk, with experience from xAI, agrees with Wang's… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Compared to OpenAI's GPT-o1, the R1 manages to be around five times cheaper for input and output tokens, which is why the market is taking this development with uncertainty and a surprise, but there's a pretty interesting touch to it, which we'll talk about next, and how people shouldn't panic around DeepSeek's accomplishment. NVIDIA has generated gigantic revenue over the past few quarters by selling AI compute resources, and mainstream companies in the Magnificent 7, including OpenAI, have access to superior technology compared to DeepSeek. Given that DeepSeek has managed to train R1 with confined computing, imagine what the companies can bring to the markets by having potent computing power, which makes this situation much more optimistic towards the future of the AI markets. There's no competition to NVIDIA's CUDA and the surrounding ecosystem, and it's safe to say that in the world where AI is emerging as a growing technology, we are just at the start. DeepSeek's implementation doesn't mark the end of the AI hype. Rather, it shows us the untapped potential of the technology, although the markets aren't taking this development with much optimism, as Team Green has managed to shave $300 billion+ from its market cap after DeepSeek's R1. But, we expect the dust to settle, once people realize the positive outcome of the situation. Moreover, this will prompt companies like Meta, Google and Amazon to speed up their respective AI solutions, and as a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst says, DeepSeek's achievement should rather turn us more bullish towards NVIDIA and the future of AI.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq futures tank, Dow tumbles 350 points as AI fears rock tech stocks

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.
