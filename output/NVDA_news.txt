Title: If You Invested $10,000 in Nvidia 10 Years Ago, Here’s How Much You Would Have Today

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, powering much of the infrastructure behind generative AI and data centers. This demand propelled its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion, supported by a roughly 39% year-to-date gain in its stock price. Yet concerns persist about increasing competition from rivals and a potential slowdown in AI spending, raising fears of an AI bubble burst. While the stock’s performance may feel disappointing to some investors after explosive gains in prior years, a near-40% return would have been phenomenal for Nvidia 10 years ago. But had you had the foresight to invest $10,000 in the stock in early January 2016 and hold through today, the results tell a remarkable story of transformation. It is important to see where Nvidia came from over the past decade to understand where it stands today. In early 2016, Nvidia primarily focused on graphics processing units for PC gaming. Its GeForce lineup dominated the market for video game graphics accelerators, delivering high-performance visuals for gamers. The company generated record annual revenue in fiscal 2016, largely from its gaming segment, which accounted for about three quarters of the total. At the time, AI applications remained in their infancy and had not yet entered the public consciousness as a viable technology for changing industry and the world around us. Back then, Nvidia’s data center business was small, generating only $339 million for all of 2015. The stock traded at split-adjusted prices around $0.80 per share as the new year began, accounting for subsequent splits, including the 4-for-1 split in 2021 and the 10-for-1 split in 2024. Nvidia’s evolution accelerated in the late 2010s. The metaverse was a thing for 15 minutes until cryptocurrency mining surged between 2017 and 2018, with miners using Nvidia GPUs for proof-of-work algorithms in coins like Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). This drove unexpected demand, boosting gaming segment revenue despite volatility — Nvidia noted crypto’s contributions but maintained its focus on its core gaming GPUs. As crypto mining waned after several market crashes, Nvidia shifted toward AI and deep learning. Researchers had used its GPUs for machine learning since the early 2010s, and the company released products like the DGX-1 in 2016 for AI training. Explosive growth in generative AI after 2022 — ChatGPT was released in late November that year the public began to take notice — cemented Nvidia as the premier AI chipmaker, with its data center segment now dominating. Nvidia’s revenue transformation has been just as dramatic. Where 2016 annual revenue stood at $5 billion, Nvidia reported $57 billion in revenue for just the third quarter of fiscal 2026 — exceeding the entire 2016 yearly figure tenfold in just three months. Its stock price growth mirrored this shift. From those penny-per-share split-adjusted levels near January 2016, Nvidia is currently trading above $187 per share today. This represents a price appreciation of over 23,600%. Considering Nvidia’s entire market cap was about $17 billion a decade ago, it’s not surprising to learn you would be sitting on a not-so-small fortune with it priced at $4.5 trillion. But how big is big? Over the last 10 years, Nvidia’s total return — yes, the chipmaker pays a nominal dividend yielding 0.02% — would have turned a $10,000 investment in early January 2016 into more than $2.37 million. This performance underscores Nvidia’s successful pivot from gaming to AI leadership, turning early investors into millionaires despite the occasional downturn. It’s why you should buy stocks with the idea of never selling them, and holding on through periods of volatility. It’s not necessary that all your stocks perform like Nvidia, as just one monster homerun swing can set you up for life. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trading lower as we begin the final trading week of 2025, albeit a holiday-shortened one once again. The major indices all finished the session modestly lower on Friday, with the venerable S&P 500 taking early bows as it hit a fresh all-time high, joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, which recently entered all-time high territory. With just two full trading days left in the year, you can expect some volatility this week as investors and traders make final portfolio adjustments to close out the year. With sellers sneaking in late Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial closed at 48,710, down 0.04%, while the aforementioned S&P 500 backed off its intra-day all-time high print to close at 6.929 down 0.03%. The Nasdaq finished the day at 21,593, down 0.09%. Yields were flat to moderately lower on Friday as portfolio shuffling and some light profit-taking seemed to be the order for the day. The strong GDP data have challenged expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts next year, supporting a more hawkish stance among some Fed officials. Market pricing currently implies up to two rate cuts in 2026, while the median policymaker projection points to only one. Goldman Sachs said in the fall that it expects two more 25-basis-point reductions in 2026. The 30-year long bond closed Friday at 4.82% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.13%. Both major oil benchmarks closed lower on Friday, with analysts pointing to the usual thin post-holiday trading as concerns about a looming global supply glut outweigh geopolitical supply risks, despite recent disruptions from actions against Venezuela and the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Brent Crude closed the day at $60.87, down 2.2%, while West Texas Intermediate finished Friday’s session at $56.94, down 2.2%. The big winner on Friday was Natural Gas, which had taken a beating over the previous two weeks, as it surged 3.5% higher to close at $4.39. Analysts cited cold weather, high LNG exports, and tighter storage levels, which are expected to drive winter demand upward despite warmer spells. Plus, short covering after a 20%+ move down was a possible reason for the gains. Gold continued to race higher after smashing through the $4500 mark earlier in the week, to finish Friday at $4,494. More positive coverage at Goldman Sachs, which sees the precious metal hitting $4,900 in 2026 and says “Gold remains our single favorite long commodity,” was a factor in Friday’s move higher. Silver also continued on a moonshot parabolic move, closing Friday at $75.98. Both remain at all-time highs, and investors could see additional substantial gains as we head into 2026. The crypto market saw another day of high volatility and generally mixed to lower trading on Friday, with major assets like Bitcoin initially rising modestly before sliding later in the day due to the typical thin holiday liquidity and a surge in precious metals pricing that drew significant investor capital in end-of-year moves. At 8 a.m. EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $87,580, while Ethereum was seen at $2,962. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this. MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and NVIDIA wasn't on the list.
