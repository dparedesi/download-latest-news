Title: Trump is calling Wall Street’s bluff on tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Wall Street traders embraced the term TACO — Trump always chickens out — earlier this year to describe President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again position on tariffs. Trump liked to impose hefty import taxes but would inevitably back off when markets plunged, analysts said. Now Trump is calling the market’s bluff. Yet another round of new tariffs went effect on Thursday, lifting the average tax on US imports to the highest level since the 1930s. Trump bet markets would absorb this latest news, adapt and move on — and so far he appears to have been right. Stocks still closed higher on the week, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 notching its best week in over one month. It’s a remarkable shift from early April, when the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs caused stocks across the globe to plunge. But with economists saying tariff effects could take weeks or months to play out, it’s too soon to declare victory just yet. “He is succeeding in implementing major tariffs without shocking the stock market,” said Ethan Harris, former head of global economics at Bank of America. “It’s surprising, and you could call it an accomplishment if you’re in favor of tariffs.” Trump may be winning the hand, but Wall Street has lots of cards left. The game isn’t over. Investors in recent months have embraced the “TACO” trade. A better description would be, “Trump always tries again,” according to Harris. With the latest import taxes, Trump is pushing forward with an average tariff rate just slightly slower than what he tried to impose on April 2, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. While stocks are hovering near record highs, Harris said he expects tariffs will inflict “real damage” on the economy, and it remains to be seen if investors will stay complacent. The inclusion of carveouts has softened the blow of tariffs, according to Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income at UBS. That has helped temper investors’ concerns. Apple (AAPL), for example, is exempt from tariffs on some imports from India and tariffs on semiconductors because of its pledge to develop production in the United States. Apple stock last week soared 13% and had its best week since 2020. “The tariff wall being built by the administration also has many holes because of numerous product exemptions, carveouts and delayed implementation dates,” Reiman said. Enthusiasm about the AI boom in the United States is also driving market momentum and drawing attention away from tariffs. While investors have been concerned about trade, blowout earnings from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) have helped buoy the market. In addition, trading partners have largely not retaliated, avoiding a global trade war that would have had worse outcomes for the US economy, according to David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie. “What’s really struck me is how little Trump has had to chicken out from,” Robert Armstrong, the Financial Times columnist who coined the term “TACO,” told CNN’s Richard Quest in an August 1 interview. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked in early April above 50 points — a historic level not seen since the Covid pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The VIX in August just briefly breached 20 points — a level associated with slightly noticeable volatility — before retreating. Investors are maintaining faith in a “Trump put,” or the notion that if the markets do plummet, the president will refine his approach. The “Trump put” is different from chickening out, analysts say, as the president might back down just enough to satisfy markets before pushing forward again with his tariffs when he is able to. “He always tries again until the equity market punishes the policy,” Harris said. “That’s the old ‘Trump put’ idea, which is the way people used to talk about it, and is still the correct way to think about the trade war.” While Trump has implemented his tariffs, it might be too soon to call victory. Investors are awaiting data on inflation and the labor market in upcoming months to get a better sense of how tariffs are impacting the economy. “As an investor, you can talk yourself into not worrying about tariffs, but if you’re a company trying to make business plans, you can’t afford to ignore the tariffs,” Harris said. “The stock market and the economy are not the same thing.” Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said investors are taking two leaps of faith in believing in the resilience of the US economy and that “the stagflationary impulse of tariffs” — slower growth and stickier inflation — won’t be as bad as initially feared. Markets are a “little too complacent,” Sai said, and he will be watching the next two inflation reports ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting for any sign of tariff-induced increases in prices. “By no means are we out of the woods,” Sai said. “ We are priced for nothing to go wrong, and yet we still have a very important inflection point ahead of us.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not manufacture GPUs. It does not develop AI models. Additionally, it seldom attracts attention like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nonetheless, Arista has quietly emerged as one of the most impactful technology firms in the market. Strong Q2 results and elevated guidance propelled the stock to all-time highs, climbing 20% in the last five days compared to a 1.7% increase for the S&P 500. Three significant figures illustrate why Arista ranks among the most profitable and resilient players in the industry. Seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, check out What’s Happening With Joby Stock? Arista achieved a 40.3% net margin in Q2—higher than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), or Microsoft. It also sells hardware. The catalyst is Arista’s cloud-native EOS (Extensible Operating System), which transforms conventional networking hardware into a software-defined platform. This leads to high margins and stable, recurring demand from hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft (accounting for over 40% of revenue). Over half of Arista’s revenue is converted into cash. Its 54% operating cash flow margin ranks among the top 5% of S&P 500 firms—including most SaaS companies. This cash supports innovation, growth, and a balance sheet that is already among the strongest in the tech industry. Having $8.1 billion in cash (56% of assets) and no debt allows Arista to invest during downturns, protect its market standing, and expand globally without needing external financing. This strength has been tested: Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Arista is valued at 23.5x sales, 50.7x earnings, and 46.2x free cash flow—significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. On paper, it appears more like a SaaS company than a conventional networking entity. The distinction lies in execution. With established demand from major cloud providers, software-like margins, and an expanding role in AI data centers, Arista is enhancing its position in a rapidly growing market. Arista is not widely acknowledged outside of technology circles, but its profitability, strong balance sheet, and role in AI infrastructure render it a pivotal player in the sector. The stock is not inexpensive, and hazards persist, yet its performance has consistently justified its valuation. For investors seeking opportunities beyond chips and AI models, Arista provides access to the infrastructure that supports AI’s expansion—and the market is beginning to recognize this. That being said, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that?

In terms of assessing how the general economy is responding to tariff and other uncertainty shocks, one might want to look at the SP500 excluding the Magnificent 7. As of August 8, SP500 market cap was $54.2 trillion; ex-Magnificent 7 was $36.7 trillion. Hence, the stock market is looking quite good partly because of the performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) stocks. The question is whether this outperformance is durable. One might say that the cyclically adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is not quite up to 2021M11 levels, so not to worry. I’ll just note that inflation expectations adjusted 10 year rates are now much higher: 2.1% in May vs. -1.0%. Figure 1: Cyclically adjusted price-earning (CAPE) ratio (black, left scale), and ten year ex ante real rate, % (light blue +, right scale). Real rate calculated by subtracting 10 year median SPF expected inflation rate from 10 yr Treasury yield. August CAPE observation based on data through 8/8. NBER defined peak-to-trough recession dates shaded gray. Source: Shiller, Treasury via FRED, Philadelphia Fed, NBER and author’s calculations. Cape is as high in general to 2021. So yeah, its a problem. Margin debt is even higher. This seems concerning: “SCOOP: Trump’s team is considering longtime Bureau of Labor Statistics critic E.J. Antoni to run agency just after president fired Erika McEntarfer” https://x.com/schwartzbWSJ/status/1954660412407922766 And, he’s announced Antoni’s nomination. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/trump-antoni-bls-statistics.html I don’t think their relative market cap is the biggest issue. More salient is how concentrated earnings have become. In the aggregate the S&P 500 set another all time earnings record in Q2: https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_080825.pdf But a month ago.Earnings Insight forecast that “ In aggregate, the “Magnificent 7” companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 14.1% for the second quarter. Excluding these seven companies, the blended (combines actual and estimated results) earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 would be 3.4% for Q2 2025”: https://insight.factset.com/are-magnificent-7-companies-still-top-contributors-to-earnings-growth-for-the-sp-500-for-q2 CNBC says today that the magnificent 7 stocks profits grew 26% in Q2: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/sp-500-earnings-growth-would-be-dull-without-26percent-increase-from-mag-7.html One of the important things I look at is the advance-decline line, I.e., how many of the companies’ stocks are participating in the rally? Here they are: https://www.marketinout.com/chart/market.php?breadth=advance-decline-line Every market segment is currently showing no net advances in the past month, and a few of them are showing significant declines. In other words, the vast majority of companies have shown pedestrian earnings growth, and have had pedestrian stock price advances, if at all. I don’t think the advance-decline is a big problem yet. If memory serves, the A/D line had about a 50% decline from peak before the tech bubble popped in 2000. Very nice. A question: Having never given A/D analysis much thought until now, I’m curious whether a 50% decline ahead of one of the worst stock market declines in U.S. history amounts to a special case. Did it take an investing public too engaged in speculative buying to notice anything but their object of speculative buying to create that situation? Might we look for either a smaller decline in the A/D line to lead to a decline in overall equity market value in more common cases? While we’re at it, bullishness, as measured by a good many conventional bull/bear indicators, is high. Here’s the CNNMoney indicator, with components: https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed To NDd’s point about market breadth, the McClellan Volume Summation Index (a component of the CNN indicato), which is one method for comparing the number of gainers to losers, is neutral. I understand that portfolio cash levels are relatively low, despite a fairly good return to cash. Another contrarian indicator; not much fuel for additional gains.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Waiting For NVIDIA

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the second busiest week, the second-quarter earnings season begins to slow down this week, with just 6 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Deere (DE) and Applied Materials (AMAT). According to FactSet, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 90% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 11.8% year-over-year, well above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 10.3%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.3%. Following the better earnings results, the S&P 500 came within a hair of an all-time high last week, while the Magnificent 7 reached a new peak. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to Apple and Tesla. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 were the group to watch this earnings season, and they did not disappoint aside from Tesla (TSLA). Furthermore, the artificial intelligence (AI) related companies reinforced the positive narrative surrounding the technology. With earnings season nearing completion, all eyes now shift to NVIDIA (NVDA), which is scheduled to report on August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the healthcare and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 6.3% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the financials and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Earnings season slows to a crawl beginning this week. While the individual reports are crucial for that stock, none are going to change the overall color of the season at this point. Friday’s retail sales numbers will be an essential check on the US consumer. The soft monthly jobs report with massive downward revisions to start the month was worrisome for the health of the economy. Since the consumer drives the US economy, retail sales will be closely watched to see if the labor market is spilling over to spending. Consumer inflation (CPI) on Tuesday will be notable as the odds of a September short-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have risen to 90% following the weaker-than-expected jobs report. Year-over-year CPI is expected to increase to 2.8% from 2.7%, but the data will be watched for signs that the Fed needs to delay any cuts to fight inflation. There is still one more monthly jobs report before the Fed’s September meeting, and barring an abnormally large inflation surge, the labor market will be the primary driver behind any rate cuts or lack thereof. In addition, markets have now fully priced in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) in 2025. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a market mover. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) releases its 13F filing after the close on Thursday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks, but this report provides the details. An analysis of Berkshire’s quarterly earnings is here. The increase in worries about the economy in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report eased this week, with the betting odds of recession falling to the lows of the year. The falling odds of recession and another week of better-than-expected earnings sent stocks to near record highs.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief. The White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States’ most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month. But smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump’s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it’s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday. That’s not to say tariffs won’t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company $1.1 billion this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in. Under different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America come from India. And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple’s largest market. “In terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. “I think what’s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they’re going to capitalize on AI.” Tariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage. A combination of Apple’s diversified supply chain – which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID – along with its high margins and Cook’s operations expertise put the company in a strong position. Supply chain resilience is “supposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,” said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys. That held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday. While moves like these don’t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.” Some analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday’s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future. “Because (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,” said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation’s data and analytics team. “But it is important, of course. It does present a risk.” That said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple’s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don’t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can’t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don’t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance. “It’s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,” said Bjørhovde. “Because you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.” Cook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for “a while” during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company’s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside. “Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we’re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we’re doing the glass here, we’re doing the Face ID module here, and so there’s a ton of it, and we’re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,” Cook said. “And so there’s a lot of content in there from United States.” The narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year – and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers. And the company’s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple’s. Just this week, Google posted an ad for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: “If you buy a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.” Apple’s initial batch of AI features also didn’t launch in time for the iPhone 16’s arrival last September. At the same time, many of Apple’s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple (AAPL) might reach first. That’s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta (META) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models. Still, Apple saw stellar earnings results for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales – including in China – and overall revenue. But during Apple’s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company’s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap. “Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,” Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. “We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” But Apple can’t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone’s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm – the three of which dominate the Android phone space – to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “What’s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?” he said. “I mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that’s the real focus on Apple right now.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
