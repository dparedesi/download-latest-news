U.S. equities were mostly in the red at midday, dragged for a second session by tech stocks, as well as a mixed bag of earnings news. The Nasdaq dropped 1%, the S&P 500 was down as well, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Shares of artificial intelligence (AI)-related firms, including Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA), continued to lose ground on concerns about a possible slowdown in corporate AI spending. Target (TGT) shares tumbled when the struggling retailer replaced its CEO and posted another drop in sales. La-Z-Boy (LZB) shares sank after the furniture manufacturer's earnings declined on fewer in-store sales and soft demand for its Joybird brand. TJX (TJX) shares gained when the operator of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods stores exceeded profit forecasts and raised its guidance, saying it expects to be able to offset any tariff costs. Shares of Jack Henry & Associations (JKHY) advanced after the financial technology firm posted better-than-expected results as customers spent more on tech products. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares increased on an upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the processed food company's portfolio is attractive, with consumers interested in eating foods with more protein and fewer artificial ingredients. Oil and gold futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher. TradingView

Title: AI Industry Trembles as Nvidia's Stock Nosedives
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-industry-nvidia-stock
Time Published: 2025-08-20T14:39:27Z
Full Content:
Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia plunged on Wednesday, dropping by more than three percent in early trading — for a total slide of over five percent in the past week. Other major AI players fell as well, including Google, Meta, and Tesla. AI software company Palantir's stock fell by nearly nine percent this morning. Nvidia is particularly interesting, though, because while those other companies mainly produce software, Nvidia has been making bank by selling the hardware powering the AI industry's explosive ascent. If the AI industry is a gold rush, then Nvidia is selling shovels — and when the shovel seller starts to struggle, everybody gets nervous. Analysts were left perplexed by the selloff, casting around for specific causes. Could muted enthusiasm and AI data center Coreweave's 38 percent collapse post Q2 earnings be coming after the AI industry's top performers? Nvidia's shares fell after Reuters reported that the firm was working on a new generation AI chip for the Chinese market, which could potentially outperform its H20 workhorse. There are also certain signs of internal shakiness, with CEO Jensen Huang recently 150,000 shares for tens of millions of dollars last week. However, the sale was planned in March, and was triggered by hitting predetermined parameters, such as price and volume. In other words, it's not entirely clear what's causing the selloff. Nvidia and its ilk are still up considerably if you zoom out; both Nvidia and Palantir hit all-time highs earlier this month. Palantir alone rose more than 150 percent since April. Could the latest selloff be a market correction, a reality check in light of some sky-high valuations? There has been considerable talk of the AI industry showing signs of a dot com era-style bubble. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself acknowledged last week that we're in a "phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI." How long Nvidia's drop in share price will last remains to be seen. The company's meteoric rise has repeatedly been met by bullish investors buying the dip, sending it to all-time highs. Nvidia will be reporting its second-quarter earnings a week from now. Investors expect strong Q2 results, and given enormous sales and continued optimism surrounding AI, it's not a stretch to assume they'll be satisfied. If anything, investors are as optimistic as ever, suggesting that the AI industry's gravy train isn't likely to stop any time soon. "NVDA is now the most under-owned large-cap tech stock," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this week, as quoted by Yahoo Finance.

Title: Nvidia Considering 'Variety of Products' as New China AI Chip Details Emerge

Time Published: 2025-08-19T18:02:09Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) said it's considering a "variety of products" for its roadmap as more details emerge about a new AI chip for the Chinese market. This follows recent signs of inroads in winning approvals from the Trump administration to expand sales to the country. Nvidia could look to deliver samples of the new chip to Chinese clients for testing as early as next month, Reuters reported Tuesday. The new chip, tentatively known as the B30A, is based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and more advanced than the H20 chip the company recently won approval to resume selling in China after striking a deal with President Trump to pay the U.S. government 15% of its China chip revenue. A Nvidia spokesperson told Investopedia Tuesday that the company wants to be "prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow," adding "everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use." Shares of Nvidia fell close to 4% amid broader tech sector losses Tuesday. Still, they've added nearly a third of their value this year, after their recent rally amid optimism about the company's sales in China and strong demand for AI hardware. While many on Wall Street saw the recent 15% revenue-sharing agreements for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a positive development for the companies—which took a hit on export curbs earlier in the year—some have raised concerns about what they could mean for American tech companies navigating rapidly changing China trade policies. "It feels like a slippery slope to us," Bernstein analysts wrote last week of the deals, which could open the door to others and pointed to a lack of clarity on whether and how much companies could be pushed to pay to sell such products in China. "Sure it might raise some money, but doesn't seem to address any strategic issues beyond a grab for dollars," the analysts said. Last week, Trump suggested he could be open to expanding Nvidia's licenses to cover more powerful chips, after further negotiations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang could be asked for more details on the company's plans when the chipmaker reports its latest quarterly financial results after the bell Aug. 27. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent share price values.

With thousands of more games on the way, the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will deliver cutting-edge graphics and the fastest frame rates in the cloud without raising membership prices. “Bringing the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, one of the world’s most important computer graphics innovations, to GeForce NOW represents the biggest leap in cloud gaming ever,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Blackwell, GeForce NOW offers even more stunning graphics, the fastest frame rates and negligible latency to turn any device into a high-quality gaming rig that rivals nearly every other product on the market today.” Members will gain advanced features like NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, pushing streaming up to 5K resolution at 120 frames per second (fps) — previously only possible with the most advanced gaming PCs. The upgrade adds support for up to 360 fps at 1080p with NVIDIA Reflex technology and click-to-pixel response times as low as 30 milliseconds. Tapping a global network of NVIDIA SuperPODs, the majority of gamers in GeForce NOW-supported regions will see sub-30-millisecond network latency. In addition, a new Cinematic-Quality Streaming (CQS) mode uses a host of technological advancements to significantly improve image quality. Borderlands 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and The Outer Worlds 2 are among the new AAA games that will join GeForce NOW, now totaling more than 2,300 games. That number will double instantly with the launch of Install-to-Play, a feature that brings more of gamers’ PC collections to the cloud with new cloud storage. The Ultimate UpgradeThe NVIDIA Blackwell architecture features enhanced ray tracing and AI-powered rendering, enabling more realistic lighting, richer textures and faster computation to run real-time graphics for even the most demanding games. With the introduction of GeForce RTX 5080-class GPUs, the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier will deliver a stunning 62 teraflops of compute performance and a massive 48GB frame buffer, which enables AI-enhanced gaming experiences and prepares the platform for the future of AI in gaming. The latest GPU architecture offers up to 2.8x faster frame rates compared with previous-generation servers and outpaces the PlayStation 5 Pro by more than 3x. Enhanced by the latest AMD “Zen 5” CPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX®-7 SmartNICs, GeForce NOW features the most advanced hardware in cloud gaming. Plus, NVIDIA’s broadband connectivity and mobile partner network continues to grow, with new collaborations with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom AG and more. Comcast is enhancing low-latency GeForce NOW cloud gaming through the DOCSIS telecommunications standard, Deutsche Telekom AG is integrating GeForce NOW into its 5G+ network and BT Group plans to trial L4S and 5G slicing to deliver consistent, high-quality 5G performance — whether at home or on the go. Cinematic-Quality StreamingMembers will experience a noticeable leap in graphics fidelity with CQS for the highest-quality visual experiences in the cloud. CQS features a suite of technologies powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, delivering: Games MultiplierPublishers are bringing the biggest blockbusters and acclaimed indie hits to GeForce NOW, expanding its cloud library of preinstalled, ready-to-play games to over 2,300 titles. A host of AAA games will be available to play in the cloud at launch. Upcoming releases include Hell Is Us, a mystery adventure from Nacon, followed by 2K’s and Gearbox Software’s Borderlands 4 and Techland’s Dying Light: The Beast. “NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade is a game-changer for Gearbox that significantly elevates the gameplay experiences for our players,” said Brian Burleson, vice president of strategic partnerships at Gearbox Entertainment. “GeForce NOW brings the games and universes within them to almost any screen imaginable so that every last detail we’ve worked so hard on is visible. We’re proud to be part of this next era of cloud gaming.” “Castor Woods in Dying Light: The Beast is the most beautiful world we ever created, with huge improvements to dynamic lighting, physics and graphics,” said Tymon Smektała, Dying Light franchise director at Techland. “With GeForce NOW’s Blackwell architecture, these improvements will be available to more players than ever, even those without high-end PCs at home.” Gamers can also look forward to the return of the beloved sci-fi role-playing game The Outer Worlds 2 from Obsidian Entertainment; the sci-fi action of Embark Studio’s Arc Raiders; as well as the highly anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive and White Wolf. The heart-pounding Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from Activision is also joining the cloud at launch, as well as a new sci-fi third-person shooter from BigFire Games and NCSoft called CINDER CITY. “We’re focused on giving players more choice in how and where they play, and NVIDIA’s Blackwell-powered GeForce NOW upgrade helps us do that,” said Craig Duncan, head of Xbox Game Studios. “With enhanced performance and visual fidelity, it’s now easier for players to jump into their favorite worlds, connect with friends and discover new adventures.” Also new with the GeForce NOW upgrade, Install-to-Play games are made possible by cutting-edge cloud storage servers using high-performance NVIDIA NVMesh technology. Members will gain access to double the game catalog, streaming more than 2,200 additional Steam titles that publishers have enabled for cloud streaming on GeForce NOW, with more to come. This means GeForce NOW’s library will expand to over 4,500 Ready-to-Play and Install-to-Play titles. “Seeing so many AAA and indie games arriving on GeForce NOW is a great win for studios and gamers alike,” said Larry Kuperman, vice president of business development at Nightdive Studios. “Expanding the GeForce NOW library with thousands of additional Steam titles means more gamers than ever can experience our worlds — seamlessly and instantly, on nearly any device — for a true PC experience in the cloud.” Install-to-Play games are downloaded directly to cloud storage, mirroring the experience of having them on a local PC. GeForce NOW Ultimate and Performance members will receive 100GB of single-session cloud storage for Install-to-Play games at no additional cost to their membership. Members will also be able to expand their cloud storage with persistent storage add-ons: 200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month. Install-to-Play games saved in persistent storage will remain ready to launch without the need to download and reinstall for every session. More Frames on More DevicesLaunched earlier this year, GeForce RTX 5080-powered servers are giving the native GeForce NOW app on Steam Deck a performance boost from 60 to 90 fps. LG monitors and TVs are among the first to benefit from GeForce NOW RTX 5080 server upgrades. Supported LG OLED monitors can also stream in ultra-high 5K (5120×2880) when connected to Windows or macOS devices — no extra hardware needed. LG TVs are also leading the way as the world’s first to stream 4K at 120Hz with HDR through a native app on supported LG TVs. Support for popular peripherals also grows, with native support for many Logitech racing wheels offering the lowest-latency, most responsive driving experiences. In addition, the GeForce NOW Mac client will receive all the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture upgrades, turning Apple computers into high-performance gaming machines. More Easily Connect With GamersNVIDIA, Discord and Epic are partnering to transform how people discover and play games together — making it easier than ever for gamers to stay connected. Powered by NVIDIA GeForce NOW’s game streaming technology and distributed through Discord, the new integrated experience lets players try new games instantly on Discord — no downloads, installs or launchers — without missing a beat of gameplay. This new integrated experience will let gamers try Fortnite directly in Discord, if they do not have the game installed, through a limited-time trial of the GeForce NOW Performance experience — even without a GeForce NOW membership. Players only need to create or connect their Epic accounts before instantly dropping into Fortnite. The integration makes it easier for Discord’s hundreds of millions of users to discover streamed game experiences, such as Fortnite sessions, helping game developers expand their reach where conversations about games are already happening. Pricing, Availability and PromotionsThe GeForce NOW upgrade featuring the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture will begin rolling out in September. GeForce NOW Ultimate remains available for $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months, and includes access to RTX 5080 servers. Performance memberships remain available at $9.99 per month or $49.99 for six months. Daily, monthly and annual membership will be available starting at launch.

Title: Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to announce its Q2 2026 earnings at the end of August (January fiscal year). Analysts anticipate earnings of $1 per share, an increase from $0.68 in the same quarter last year, and revenues are projected to grow by over 50% year-over-year to $45.60 billion. This growth is likely to be fueled by the sustained strong demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. Nvidia has been increasing large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their cutting-edge AI functionalities and premium pricing, may assist in driving revenue growth during Q2 FY’26, while also enhancing margins. Historically, NVDA stock has tended to outperform following earnings releases, having risen 60% of the time with a median one-day increase of 4.5% and a maximum observed increase of 24%. The company holds a current market capitalization of $4.4 trillion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $149 billion, and it was operationally profitable, achieving $86 billion in operating profits and a net income of $77 billion. Although much will depend on how results compare to consensus expectations, recognizing historical trends may improve your chances if you are an event-driven trader. Should you Buy Or Fear Nvidia stock? For event-driven traders, historical trends might provide an advantage, whether by positioning prior to earnings or responding to post-release movements. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than that of individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is low) is to assess the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader could position themselves “long” for the upcoming 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the association between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Occasionally, peer performance can impact post-earnings stock reactions. Indeed, the pricing-in may start before the earnings announcements are made. Here is some historical data illustrating the past post-earnings performance of NVIDIA stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings immediately before NVIDIA. For an equitable comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (the combination of all three, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), delivering strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride compared to an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception.
