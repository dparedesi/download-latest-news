Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © pestoverde / Flickr Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is pushing higher on a report from Truth Social that the tech giant could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and other high-demand areas. All under the condition that a quarter of sales be paid to the U.S. government. As a result, analysts at Bernstein just initiated an outperform rating on NVDA, noting that if reports are accurate, NVDA can ship chips to some customers in China, which is a positive development. Just yesterday, analysts at Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia, citing a significant opportunity with data centers. After all, artificial intelligence will continue to create massive demand for data centers. Right now, according to MIT Technology Review, there are about 3,000 data centers across the U.S. Plus, according to a report from McKinsey, $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure investments will be needed by 2030. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are down about $2.62 at the moment. However, Deutsche Bank analysts see more upside heading into earnings. The firm reiterated its buy rating on MU ahead of the company’s earnings on December 17, with a price target of $280, up from $200. The firm believes MU is well-positioned to benefit from the memory cycle, with HBM driving structural changes in the semiconductor industry. And down, but not out, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are being viewed positively by analysts at Needham. The firm has a buy rating on NFLX and doesn’t believe it needs Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the firm, “NFLX buying WBD would put $83B of additional value at risk of being disrupted by GenAI. Without WBD, NFLX is more global, more nimble, more tech-first, and has more flexibility with the Hollywood unions (called Guilds),” as quoted by CNBC. Just the other day, Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on NFLX. The firm noted, “We acknowledge that NFLX shares have been largely reactive to recent developments re: potential strategic outcomes. But we believe Netflix’s long-term fundamental outlook is increasingly strengthening, thanks to its highly compelling value proposition, its excellent execution track record, and its improved global, competitive positioning,” as quoted by CNBC.

Title: Nvidia-Backed CoreWeave's Stock Slumps. Here's What's Behind Monday's Slide
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-backed-coreweave-stock-slumps-here-is-what-is-behind-monday-slide-crwv-11864028
Time Published: 2025-12-08T19:18:50Z
Full Content:
Shares of CoreWeave (CRWV) lost ground Monday after the cloud computing company said it would sell $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The shares were down close to 5% in recent trading. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The data center provider backed by AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said the convertible senior notes coming due in 2031 will be made in a private offering, and initial investors would have the option to purchase an additional $300 million worth within a 13-day period from the issuance date. Convertible debt offerings can offer a relatively simple and inexpensive way for companies to raise capital. However, existing shareholders may view them negatively, as they can be dilutive and may raise concerns about a company's debt levels. CoreWeave said that a portion of the proceeds will be used for capped call transactions, with the rest for general corporate purposes. The move comes after a recent pullback in CoreWeave's shares amid worries about an AI bubble, after a big run-up in its stock following its public debut in March. Even with CoreWeave's recent losses, the stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price.

December 08, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An AI-powered humanoid robot is a sophisticated machine designed to resemble the human body and behavior, equipped with artificial intelligence to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These robots can process natural language, recognize visual cues, and make decisions based on data inputs. They are utilized in various sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing, and customer service, where they can assist with tasks ranging from patient care to assembly line work. A report from Market.us on the Global AI-powered Humanoid Robots Market size said it is expected to be worth around USD 7,739.0 Million By 2034, from USD 352.3 Million in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 36.2% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 53.4% share, holding USD 188.0 Million revenue. The report said: “This expansion is fueled by the rising need for automation, labor shortages, and the potential for robots to perform tasks that are hazardous or monotonous for humans. Industries such as healthcare, retail, and manufacturing are increasingly adopting humanoid robots to enhance operational efficiency and service delivery. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region, led by countries like Japan, South Korea, and China, is witnessing robust growth due to substantial investments in robotics and AI technologies. Several factors are propelling the demand for AI-powered humanoid robots. Technological advancements in AI and machine learning have enhanced the capabilities of these robots, making them more adaptable and efficient. Economic factors, such as rising labor costs and the need for automation, are encouraging businesses to invest in robotic solutions.

In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. “CUDA GPU-accelerated computing is revolutionizing design — enabling simulation at unprecedented speed and scale, from atoms to transistors, from chips to complete systems, creating fully functional digital twins inside the computer,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design — empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future.” Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares surged about 4% on last Wednesday (12/4) after commentary on the prospect of humanoid robot support from Washington. The move extended into Thursday trading, with the stock rising about 2% on opening as investors weighed the outlook for Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot project. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the White House is considering an executive order in 2026 to back humanoid robotics with funding or incentives, which could accelerate deployment and adoption, Levy wrote. Levy added robotics are increasingly viewed as a strategic area of competition with China, prompting companies to seek federal support for automation, supply chains and rollouts. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) Robotics News: Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That’s the foundation of Google DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that “think” before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics. The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. “Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task,” said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind. Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) - The Qualcomm Robotics RB6 Platform powers the next-generation robotics and intelligent machines including autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), delivery robots, highly automated manufacturing robots, urban air mobility (UAM) aircrafts, autonomous defense solutions, and beyond.

Home » Artificial intelligence » XAI Grok 4.2 May Have Cracked the Code on Trading xAI Grok 4.20 created a 47% return in the Nasdaq and outperformed all others in the Alpha Arena competition. 32 instances of various LLMs (including multiple variants of the same model under different prompting strategies like “Situational Awareness,” “Monk Mode,” “Max Leverage,” and “New Baseline”) were each allocated $10,000 in real money to trade autonomously on the Nasdaq exchange. The total capital across all participants was $320,000. Models had to generate trading ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human intervention, using only market data inputs. This lasted 2 weeks and focused on volatile tech stocks, including Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), and others. Grok 4.20 executed 105 trades and dominated the leaderboard, with its top instance (Situational Awareness strategy) achieving a +47% return (growing $10,000 to $14,698), with an aggregate return across its instances cited as approximately 12.11% (possibly an averaged or weighted figure).

He is open to public speaking and advising engagements. Captain America vs Captain America… neither side wins The FIRST to use AI will do well but then the market will balance out when everyone else starts using AI. They will need to put some limits on stock market. AI trading “experiments” like the Grok 4 setups aren’t independently verified. Most use simulations or unclear data, not real audited trades. Results look impressive, but without transparent logs, costs, or risk control, they aren’t reliable or reproducible. The Alpha Arena is an AI trading benchmark hosted by nof1.ai, where large language models (LLMs) from various providers compete autonomously in real-market conditions using live capital ($10,000 per instance across strategies like “Situational Awareness” or “Max Leverage”). Season 1.5 focused on U.S. stock trading (e.g., volatile tech names like TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, PLTR) over two weeks ending December 3, 2025, with 32 instances totaling $320,000 deployed. Models generate trade ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human input, using market data, news, and sentiment feeds.The official site for live results, leaderboards, verifiable trade logs, and methodology details is https://nof1.ai/. It includes:Results: The “Mystery Model” (revealed as an experimental xAI Grok 4.20 beta) won with a 12.11% aggregate return ($10,000 → ~$12,111 average across instances), peaking at +47% in its top strategy. It was the only model profitable in all four sub-competitions, netting $4,844 total. Runners-up: GPT-5.1 (2nd, -9.47% avg.), Gemini 3 Pro (3rd, -32.82% avg.), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (-40.91% avg.). Full P&L charts and wallet transparency are viewable onsite. Methodology: Autonomous execution on Nasdaq via Hyperliquid (perpetuals with up to 10x leverage) 6-minute data refreshes; equal info access; no overfitting (prompts emphasize competition/rankings for “situational awareness”). All outputs/trades are public and auditable to prevent manipulation. Grok 4.20’s Edge: It executed 105 trades, leveraging real-time X/Twitter sentiment (68M daily tweets via Firehose API) for 1-5 minute signals, balancing aggressive longs ( 10x PLTR on sentiment surges) with risk controls like stop-losses. This outperformed rivals relying on delayed news/SEC filings. Elon Musk confirmed the model’s identity on X, teasing a public release in 3-4 weeks and Grok 5 next. Models continue trading post-competition for ongoing observation. TRADING Real money and real markets with trades in real time. I think buying and holding will still end up being the best way to grow investments if this turns out to be a reality once there is more long-term data. But, what I could see is a boon for prediction markets with LLMs being able to make at least semi-accurate predictions better than humans, based on being able to interpret vast amounts of information from different sources very quickly. Not for sports, but for other events such as weather, natural disasters, etc. Replying to myself, but the live stream actually did mention someone cleaning house on Polymarket which was exactly where my mind was going. The top 1% of American households owns around 30-31% of the total U.S. wealth, a share that has grown significantly over recent decades, while the bottom 50% holds a mere 2-3%. After the billionaire tech bros put most people out of work and take their share of the productivity gains, do you really think they will stop there? They will look around at who still has wealth, and look for ways to take control of that. Specifically share holders. AI gives them the power to manipulate the share market. With this they can accumulate even more of the wealth share. Also, most rich people see shareholders as an impediment. If AI can help them to retake full control of their businesses (Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft etc) then why would they not do that? After all every billionaire really wants to be a trillionaire. Communism was shown to be busted in the 20th century. Capitalism has been the most successful system so far but perhaps capitalism will cease to function in the 21st century, or perhaps it can be successfully modified? This means all those annoying traderobot ads targetting the inexperienced traders on the net are scams, Already, most trading is done by autonomous trading algorithms, trading in microseconds against each other, so much so that being physically close to the stock exchange is worth millions in electron proximity. Sometimes these programs exaggerate moves of a stock or even sector, especially volatile sectors like tech, but also small caps. In one famous instance, that also pointed to other less spectacular moves of the S&P index, a “Flash Crash” from the algorithms, resulted in several arrests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash “New regulations put in place following the 2010 flash crash[10] proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash — “when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value”[10] — and ETFs were subsequently put under greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.[10] On April 21, 2015, nearly five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid 22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation, against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British financial trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later.[11] These orders amounting to about “$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall” were “replaced or modified 19,000 times” before they were canceled.[11] Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned.[4] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation concluded that Sarao “was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances” in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.[11] Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified “so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically”.[11]” So, there are/were guardrails in place, but will they work against AI? Maybe more importantly, will a neutered SEC, CFTB, DOJ, and other agencies both in the U.S. and abroad be allowed to curb such activity? Trump’s administration has said no one should hinder the development of AI, and has been the most pro-crypto currency – a form of virtual speculation on something with no underlying value – administration in the world. Eventually, there should be enough AI competing against each other that they should cancel each other out; some will short the market/stocks too. using leverage that might bankrupt the company, sector and even potentially the entire banking sector – see: Long Term Capital Management in 1997: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management. This wasn’t AI but its sophisticated trading derivatives might have been similar to what AI could do in minutes instead of months. Faced with AI that’s too fast and unpredictable to keep up with, and tax and trading costs that whittle advantages down to nothing (what was the tax liability of these AI systems in the test?), the smartest thing for ordinary investors to do might be the oldest: Buy and Hold and index of top stocks. This was inevitable, it’s why I think their is zero chance the stock market exists in a few years, unless they globally institute massive changes, which will impact day traders the most. I think they will have to put limits in place on how fast you can buy or sell a stock, and a mandatory time of holding a stock (IE:24hrs). Comments are closed.

Title: Stocks Have Rebounded Ahead of the Fed Meeting—But the Market's Leaders Are Changing

The stock market may not be roaring into the most wonderful time of the year, but it is chugging along. Its next big test, however, is right around the corner. Investors' attention has for days largely been fixed on Wednesday's rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Rising optimism that the Fed will cut at its last meeting of 2025—based on futures market data, it's viewed as a near-certainty—has helped the major indexes recover most of the ground they lost during the volatile first three weeks of November; the major U.S. indexes are within a few percentage points of fresh records as this week draws to a close. A lot changed below the surface last month. The Magnificent Seven group of tech heavyweights— Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—nearly entered a technical correction as investors debated whether big tech was spending too much on artificial intelligence. On Nov. 20, a blowout earnings report from Nvidia failed to put AI bubble fears to rest, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) closed the day 9% below its record high. It's not that long ago that there was serious doubt among investors about whether the Fed would cut rates at its December meeting, the last of the year. Now it's seen as a virtual certainty. That might increase investor appetite for risk assets, but in the runup to the meeting a broader slice of stocks has been climbing. This year’s least-loved sectors, meanwhile, including healthcare and energy, became leaders. More than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index last month, compared with just 33% since the start of the year, suggesting “a change of leadership heading into 2026,” according to Bank of America analysts. Eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors outperformed the broader index, they wrote, while tech lagged. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, an index that tracks the stocks of companies that move goods and people around the country, rose for a tenth consecutive day on Friday. According to Dow Theory, that's a bullish sign for stocks if observed alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average. (The Dow Industrials rose on Friday, and is up nearly 5% over the past two weeks.) Fed officials are divided on how to proceed. Some policymakers fear that cutting rates too aggressively will stoke inflation, which has run above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years and reaccelerated in recent months. Others fear that leaving rates unchanged will harm the weakening job market, potentially tipping the U.S. economy into recession. The government shutdown delayed the release of several vital economic reports, leaving officials no choice but to fly partially blind next week. The most recent official labor market data that policymakers have sent mixed signals, but data from private sources suggest the job market has continued to soften. The private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November, according to payroll provider ADP. Employers announced more than 150,000 layoffs in October, the highest number for that month since 2003. Wall Street generally expects the Fed will prioritize employment over inflation next week, moving to bring rates lower. Investors see an 87% chance the Fed cuts interest rates, according to federal funds futures trading data. Just two weeks ago, that figure was 30%. Update—December 5, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect the end of trading on Friday.
