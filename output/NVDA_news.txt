Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/larry-ellisons-rise-how-he-snagged-the-title-of-worlds-richest-from-elon-musk-11807095

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.

Time Published: 2025-09-09T15:12:00Z
Full Content:
September 09, 2025 11:12 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI Infra Summit -- NVIDIA® today announced NVIDIA Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU purpose-built for massive-context processing. This enables AI systems to handle million-token software coding and generative video with groundbreaking speed and efficiency. Rubin CPX works hand in hand with NVIDIA Vera CPUs and Rubin GPUs inside the new NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform. This integrated NVIDIA MGX system packs 8 exaflops of AI compute to provide 7.5x more AI performance than NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, as well as 100TB of fast memory and 1.7 petabytes per second of memory bandwidth in a single rack. A dedicated Rubin CPX compute tray will also be offered for customers looking to reuse existing Vera Rubin 144 systems. “The Vera Rubin platform will mark another leap in the frontier of AI computing — introducing both the next-generation Rubin GPU and a new category of processors called CPX,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Just as RTX revolutionized graphics and physical AI, Rubin CPX is the first CUDA GPU purpose-built for massive-context AI, where models reason across millions of tokens of knowledge at once.” NVIDIA Rubin CPX enables the highest performance and token revenue for long-context processing — far beyond what today’s systems were designed to handle. This transforms AI coding assistants from simple code-generation tools into sophisticated systems that can comprehend and optimize large-scale software projects. To process video, AI models can take up to 1 million tokens for an hour of content, pushing the limits of traditional GPU compute. Rubin CPX integrates video decoder and encoders, as well as long-context inference processing, in a single chip for unprecedented capabilities in long-format applications such as video search and high-quality generative video. Built on the NVIDIA Rubin architecture, the Rubin CPX GPU uses a cost‑efficient, monolithic die design packed with powerful NVFP4 computing resources and is optimized to deliver extremely high performance and energy efficiency for AI inference tasks. Advancements Offered by Rubin CPX Rubin CPX delivers up to 30 petaflops of compute with NVFP4 precision for the highest performance and accuracy. It features 128GB of cost-efficient GDDR7 memory to accelerate the most demanding context-based workloads. In addition, it delivers 3x faster attention capabilities compared with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems — boosting an AI model’s ability to process longer context sequences without a drop in speed. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX, that can be combined with the NVIDIA Quantum‑X800 InfiniBand scale-out compute fabric or the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform with NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology and NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNICs™. Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX enables companies to monetize at an unprecedented scale, with $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Industry Leaders Look to Rubin CPXAI innovators are exploring how Rubin CPX can accelerate their applications, ranging from large-scale software development to the analysis of dynamic visual content to better understand moving images. Cursor, an AI-powered software company that offers an advanced code editor, sees the benefits of Rubin CPX to boost developer productivity with intelligent code generation and collaborative tools directly in the coding environment. “With NVIDIA Rubin CPX, Cursor will be able to deliver lightning-fast code generation and developer insights, transforming software creation,” said Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor. “This will unlock new levels of productivity and empower users to ship ideas once out of reach.” Runway, an American generative AI company, will use NVIDIA technologies to enable creators to produce cinematic content and sophisticated visual effects with unmatched scale and efficiency. “Video generation is rapidly advancing toward longer context and more flexible, agent-driven creative workflows,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, CEO of Runway. “We see Rubin CPX as a major leap in performance, supporting these demanding workloads to build more general, intelligent creative tools. This means creators — from independent artists to major studios — can gain unprecedented speed, realism and control in their work.” Magic is an AI research and product company developing foundation models to power AI agents that can automate software engineering. “With a 100-million-token context window, our models can see a codebase, years of interaction history, documentation and libraries in context without fine-tuning,” said Eric Steinberger, CEO of Magic. “This enables users to coach the agent at test time through conversation and access to their environments, bringing us closer to autonomous agentic experiences. Using a GPU like NVIDIA Rubin CPX greatly accelerates our compute workloads.” Software SupportNVIDIA Rubin CPX will be supported by the complete NVIDIA AI stack — from accelerated infrastructure to enterprise‑ready software. The NVIDIA Dynamo platform efficiently scales AI inference, dramatically boosting throughput while cutting response times and model serving costs. The processors will be able to run the latest in the NVIDIA Nemotron™ family of multimodal models that provide state-of-the-art reasoning for enterprise-ready AI agents. For production-grade AI, Nemotron models can be delivered with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that includes NVIDIA NIM™ microservices as well as AI frameworks, libraries and tools that enterprises can deploy on NVIDIA-accelerated clouds, data centers and workstations. Built on decades of innovation, the Rubin platform extends NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem — with NVIDIA CUDA‑X™ libraries, a community of over 6 million developers and nearly 6,000 CUDA applications. AvailabilityNVIDIA Rubin CPX is expected to be available at the end of 2026.

Title: Watch These Nebius Price Levels as Stock Surges on AI Deal With Microsoft

Nebius Group shares jumped Tuesday after the Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure provider said it has inked an agreement with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius (NBIS) will deliver computing resources to Microsoft (MSFT) later this year using a data center in New Jersey, helping the Azure owner address a demand shortage for cloud infrastructure that can process increasing AI workloads. CEO Arkady Volozh said it’s the first time Nebius had signed a long-term contract with a large tech company, and added that there are likely more to come. Nebius stock was up 37% at $88 in recent trading after hitting an all-time high near $98 in the opening minutes of the session. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2025, boosted in part by news AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a stake in the company. Below we analyze the technicals on the Nebius chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for after the stock’s big move today. After climbing to their highest level in more than three years last month, Nebius shares had consolidated in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation upon a breakout to the upside. That move higher took place on Tuesday, setting the stage for potential follow-through buying. Interestingly, prior to today’s surge, the relative strength index bottomed around its neutral reading, the same level that coincided with the end of a dip in early July. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target to monitor and also point out major support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measured move technique, a study that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying the analysis to the Nebius chart, we measure the percentage change of the steep uptrend from May to August that preceded the pennant and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value, assuming a similar continuation move may play out in the months ahead. For example, we apply a 145% increase to $72, which projects a target of $176.40—implying that the stock could more than double from Monday’s closing price. During retracements, investors should initially watch the $87 level. The stock could be snapped up at this level by investors looking for entry points on a retest of the prominent November 2021 peak, which also marks the stock’s prior all-time high. A close below this level could see the shares fall to support near $76. This area may provide support around the top of the pennant, which also corresponds with a period of trading activity on the chart between September and October 2021. Finally, a more-significant drop in Nebius shares could bring lower support at $54 into play. Investors may seek buying opportunities at this location near the February 2022 countertrend peak and a range of sideways price action on the chart that preceded a notable stock gap last month.

Shares of Nebius Group (NBIS) soared 50% in early trading Tuesday after the artificial intelligence infrastructure company struck a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) that could be valued as much as $19.4 billion. Microsoft agreed to pay the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) firm, which completed its split from Russian internet giant Yandex last year, $17.4 billion over five years to provide artificial intelligence infrastructure for a new data center in New Jersey. Microsoft “may also acquire additional services and/or capacity” for another $2 billion under the agreement. Founder and CEO Arkady Volozh said this was the first of what Nebius expects will be “significant long-term committed contracts with leading AI labs and big tech companies.” With Tuesday's surge, Nebius shares have more than tripled in value since the start of the year. Microsoft shares were up less than 1% in recent trading and have added close to 20% year-to-date.

Stock futures are slightly higher after the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a new all-time-high; Nebius Group (NBIS) shares are soaring after the company inked an AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft (MSFT); Lachlan Murdoch gains control of the media empire that includes Fox (FOX) and News Corp (NWS); Oracle (ORCL) is expected to report revenue growth when it delivers quarterly earnings after the closing bell; Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American announce merger to form copper mining giant; and Apple launches its iPhone 17. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher this morning after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high on Monday, as stocks rallied amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average come into today's session just below all-time highs of their own. Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which has been under pressure in recent weeks, is up slightly at $112,500. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is ticking higher after hitting its lowest level since April yesterday, while gold and oil futures are also edging upwards in early trading. (Read Investopedia's real-time markets coverage here.) Nebius Group (NBIS) shares are up more than 50% in premarket trading after the AI infrastructure company announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Amsterdam-based Nebius will provide Microsoft with dedicated capacity at its new data center in Vineland, New Jersey starting later this year, the company said. CNBC reported the deal was worth $19.4 billion. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) owns a stake in Nebius. “The deal will also help us to accelerate the growth of our AI cloud business even further in 2026 and beyond,” said Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh. Microsoft and Nvidia shares inched higher in premarket trading. A deal has been reached to end the yearslong fight over control of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch that includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Lachlan Murdoch, who is the CEO of Fox (FOX) and chair of News Corp (NWS), will take control of the trust that holds sizable stakes in both of his father’s companies. As part of the deal, Rupert Murdoch’s children Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will end their claim to the company. Shares of Fox and News Corp were each down nearly 5% in recent premarket trading. Investors are awaiting quarterly results from Oracle (ORCL), which are scheduled to be released after markets close today. The cloud computing giant is expected to post a 13% year-over-year jump in quarterly revenue to $15 billion, according to analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase to $1.48. The report comes after Oracle shares hit an all-time-high earlier this year on the announcement of $30 billion in new cloud deals. The stock, which has gained more than 40% since the start of 2025, was up about 1% in premarket trading. Mining firms Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American have agreed to merge to form a new global minerals company that will be one of the world’s largest producers of copper. The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, will have a combined market capitalization of more than $53 billion. “Anglo Teck will hold an industry-leading portfolio of producing operations, including six world-class copper assets, alongside high-quality premium iron ore and zinc businesses,” Teck said in a release. Shares of Canada-based Teck Resources were up about 17% in premarket trading, while U.K.-based Anglo American gained about 8% in London trading.
