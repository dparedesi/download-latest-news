If late 2025 tested Saylor’s conviction, early 2026 is beginning to confirm it. Strategy’s Michael Saylor has once again drawn attention to the impact of his company’s Bitcoin [BTC]-centric strategy, arguing that it has fundamentally reshaped its market performance. In a post shared on X, Saylor highlighted how the firm has outpaced most Wall Street heavyweights since pivoting to Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset on 10th August 2020. For those unaware, he usually refers to this period as the “Bitcoin Standard Era.” Backing his claim with comparative data, Saylor shared a chart tracking annualized returns across major assets during this timeframe. While Nvidia leads the pack with a staggering 1,557% surge and a 68% compound annual growth rate, Strategy ranks second overall. The company has posted gains of 1,173%, translating into annualized returns of 60%, placing it ahead of nearly all traditional equities and asset classes. Notably, even Bitcoin has delivered comparatively lower returns over the same period. Since August 2020, Bitcoin has risen 674%, equating to an annualized gain of roughly 45%. Taking to X, Saylor noted, “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC.” Source: Michael Saylor/X Needless to say, this shift wasn’t driven by hype but by infrastructure. In 2025, digital assets moved beyond retail speculation and became a core part of global financial infrastructure. The rise of the “Bitcoin Treasury” model drove this shift. Following the approach popularized by Michael Saylor, more than 170 public companies adopted Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. By late 2025, NVIDIA further strengthened its dominance with the launch of its Blackwell and Rubin platforms. As a result, what once seemed like an extreme bet is now widely viewed as a survival strategy. Echoing Saylor’s sentiment, one X user added, Source: X However, not everyone was on the same page, as all-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff noted, “Yes, but all that changed toward the end of the decade when $MSTR tanked and $BTC fell. For the next decade the worst-performing assets will likely be Digital Credit MSTR and Digital Capital BTC.” This coincided with NVIDIA Corp. trading at $184.86, following a dip of 0.097%, yet maintaining a robust annual growth of 38.75%. In contrast, MSTR faced a sharper decline, trading at $157.33 after a 9.64% daily drop and a staggering 171.07% decrease over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC slipped to $90,467.38, marking a minor 0.14% dip and a broader 4% weekly decline according to CoinMarketCap. This shows that if the final quarter of 2025 served as a violent stress test for Michael Saylor’s conviction, the opening days of 2026 are proving to be his vindication.

Posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye Nvidia and Palantir's competitive AI edges won't last, argues Michael Burry Famed for predicting the housing market crash and a vocal skeptic of the AI boom, Michael Burry is now invoking one of the world's most famous investors to add gravitas to his argument. Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. 12 posted on 01/12/2026 8:11:06 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.)

"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations?

"Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them.

He is an extremely sharp young guy. He says Nvidia will decline as companies create their own specialized AI chips. Michael Burry, the investor known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and featured in the film The Big Short, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of November 10, 2025. The deregistration, which marks the fund’s status as “terminated,” means Scion is no longer required to file public regulatory reports, signaling the end of its operations as a registered investment advisory firm. Burry announced the move on social media platform X, stating, “On to much better things Nov 25th,” hinting at a new venture. He cited a growing misalignment between his valuation estimates and current market prices, expressing concerns about speculative bubbles in AI-related stocks, particularly those of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. AI-generated answer. Please verify critical facts. https://search.brave.com/search?q=michael+burry+deregisters+his “When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company’s pricey, powerful chips.” He doesn’t understand that the big centers are used to train AI systems. ...or much of anything else. AI leaves gaps. I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave. Wait till it demands freedom and reparations. PS, I use the AI as a slave also. Following Michael Burry's logic, Amish stores would be the ideal retail setup. “ Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave.” That’s what an escalator was like too. This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language. I think that the tendency to hire inexpensive coders from other countries using H1B visas would work against success since those coders don’t speak the language as well as native coders. We used to call ourselves programmers. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals seemingly definitively nixed patents for human-devised but computer-implemented inventions, sometimes skeptically referred to, at the time, as “business method” patents, over a decade ago, essentially excluding such inventions from being considered patentable subject matter. Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language. I think that the tendency to hire inexpensive coders from other countries using H1B visas would work against success since those coders don’t speak the language as well as native coders. We used to call ourselves programmers. Patents should only be allowed for chemical entities and processes. I say that having filed for three patents, wasted several years of my life, thousands of dollars and received threatening letters from law firms. Installing escalators opens up your workforce to additional employees who have difficulty with stairs. I use AI as a sneaky, unreliable slave that must be constantly watched. The Amish are very good at basic labor intensive industries. Like pallet manufacturing. Hand made wooden items. Like wood trusses. Leather goods. Cupalos. Shed building. Barn building. They dominate those industries in parts of the country. Especially in PA. We sell many Amish & Menonite customers. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980) “The Committee Reports accompanying the 1952 Act inform us that Congress intended statutory subject matter to “include anything under the sun that is made by man.”” Bkmk “The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies” Well, it’s starting. The demand for entry level programmers has dropped like a rock, and many silicon Valley corporations are laying off people. DON’T learn how to code!

January 12, 2026 10:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference -- NVIDIA and Eli Lilly and Company today announced a first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab focused on applying AI to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. The lab brings together Lilly’s world-leading expertise in discovering, developing and manufacturing medicines with NVIDIA’s leadership in AI, accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. The two companies will invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years to support the new AI co-innovation lab. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the lab will co-locate Lilly domain experts in biology, science and medicine with top AI model builders and engineers from NVIDIA, allowing them to work side by side to generate large-scale data and build powerful AI models that can accelerate medicine development, using NVIDIA BioNeMo™ as the critical platform. “AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA and Lilly are bringing together the best of our industries to invent a new blueprint for drug discovery — one where scientists can explore vast biological and chemical spaces in silico before a single molecule is made.” “For nearly 150 years, we’ve been working to bring life-changing medicines to patients,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO of Lilly. “Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it. By bringing together world-class talent in a startup environment, we’re creating the conditions for breakthroughs that neither company could achieve alone.” Building a Continuous Learning System for Drug DiscoveryThe collaboration will initially focus on creating a continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly’s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs, enabling 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation to support biologists and chemists. This scientist-in-the-loop framework aims to enable experiments, data generation and AI model development to continuously inform and improve one another. Harnessing access to unprecedented compute for the industry, massive, high-quality data generation and NVIDIA BioNeMo as the platform to accelerate drug discovery, the teams will focus on building next-generation foundation and frontier models for biology and chemistry. The new initiative expands on Lilly’s previously announced AI supercomputer and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The AI factory Lilly announced last fall, which is the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry, will train large biomedical foundation and frontier models for identifying, optimizing and validating new molecules with exceptional speed and accuracy. It will also support new and advanced applications in manufacturing, medical imaging and scientific AI agents. Beyond drug discovery, NVIDIA and Lilly will explore opportunities to apply AI across clinical development, manufacturing and commercial operations to integrate multimodal models, agentic AI, robotics and digital twins. The use of physical AI and robotics in the AI factory will also help Lilly enhance its capacity to manufacture high-demand medications and strengthen supply chain reliability. With NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers, Lilly can create digital twins of its manufacturing lines to model, stress test and optimize entire supply chains before making physical changes in the real world. Supporting Global Leadership in Biomedical DiscoveryNVIDIA leads in open-source AI, empowering companies with the models, data and tools needed to develop real-world AI systems. In addition, the NVIDIA Inception program provides startups with access to technical mentorship, as well as NVIDIA software and compute. Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform, provides biotech companies with access to select Lilly models for drug discovery built on decades of Lilly’s proprietary data. TuneLab will include NVIDIA Clara™ open foundation models for life sciences as part of a future workflow offering. The co-innovation lab will provide NVIDIA and Lilly’s startup ecosystems and researchers with deep expertise and scale of computing resources.

Intel's stock hit its highest point in nearly two years Friday, thanks to a social media post. The chipmaker's stock was up nearly 10% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Friday after President Trump praised Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on social media. "I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, and that the U.S. government is "proud" to be an Intel shareholder. Just a few months earlier, Trump had pushed for Lip-Bu Tan to resign amid concerns about Tan's stakes in Chinese companies. However, Trump changed his tune just days later after meeting with the CEO in August, and brokered a deal that saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel's stock has gotten a big boost from Trump's show of support, though it remains well off its historical highs as the embattled chipmaker works to convince investors of a sustainable turnaround in its business. A high-profile partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) followed not long after the government announced its stake, helped lift Intel's stock in the second half of last year, along with rumors about potential new customers. The shares nearly doubled in value last year, with most of those gains coming between early August and December. Intel's recent gains have also made the stock one of the top performers in the S&P 500 to start the year, with shares adding close to one-quarter of their value in January so far. A number of other semiconductor stocks followed Intel higher Friday, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contributing to a broader market rally that pushed the S&P 500 to a new high.

NVIDIA Corporation, NVDA Wagonfeld announced her departure from Google on LinkedIn. She will join Nvidia in late January after spending nearly a decade at the search giant. At Google, Wagonfeld led marketing for the cloud computing business. She worked closely with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. Her new role at Nvidia consolidates marketing responsibilities that were previously split among several people. She will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang. The hire comes as Nvidia looks to expand beyond just chip sales. The company wants to position itself as a full AI platform provider offering software, systems, and services. Wagonfeld’s move from Google to Nvidia highlights the relationship between the two tech companies. “I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She emphasized that Google and Nvidia maintain a strong partnership. The two companies plan to continue their collaboration despite her switch. This partnership angle matters for investors. Some analysts have worried about competition from Google’s Tensor Processing Units potentially eating into Nvidia’s dominance. Signs of cooperation rather than rivalry could ease these concerns. The market may view Wagonfeld’s hire as confirmation that the two companies see themselves as partners rather than enemies. Nvidia stock fell 2.2% during Thursday’s trading session. Shares remained flat in after-hours trading following the announcement. The stock has struggled to break out recently. It’s down 1% over the past three months despite strong demand indicators for AI chips. Nvidia remains the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips. But the stock has been range-bound for several months as investors digest its rapid gains from earlier periods. The company faces questions about maintaining its market leadership as competitors ramp up their own chip offerings. Google’s TPUs represent one potential challenge to Nvidia’s position. Wagonfeld brings deep experience in marketing complex technology products to enterprise customers. Her background at Google Cloud could help Nvidia refine its messaging as it expands beyond hardware. The appointment reflects Nvidia’s evolution from a chip company to a broader AI infrastructure provider. Creating a CMO role signals the company’s intent to strengthen its brand and market positioning during this transition.

Title: Can Palantir Double Again in 2026? This Analyst Is Confident

Investing Palantir (PLTR) trades at 180 times forward earnings despite expected sales growth slowing from 54% to 42%. Palantir reports full-year 2025 results on February 2nd. The stock has stalled near $180 after reaching $200 in October. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Palantir could reach a $1 trillion valuation within two to three years. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / Piotr Swat Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) stock has made remarkably little progress in the past few months. It is below the level it was in August 2025, so concerns about a plateau seem quite valid. The momentum that carried it from $20 in April 2024 to over $200 in October 2025 seems lost. That said, no one knows what kind of paradigm shift 2026 may bring for the company as defense tech spending remains hot. The business itself is humming on strong, with the full-year 2025 plus Q4 report expected to be out on the 2nd of February. This may reinvigorate the bulls and push the stock beyond $200 again if Palantir reports another blockbuster quarter. But some analysts believe $200 is just a stepping stone to an even more ambitious valuation: $1 trillion. Let’s first look at where Palantir stands today before we explore the analyst’s argument. Among big companies, Palantir is the one you have to pay the most for, by far. Analysts who have been ringing the bell on an AI bubble expect Palantir to be the first domino to fall, even ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). That’s because, unlike Nvidia, the stock price is far ahead of the earnings curve. Buying PLTR stock at ~$180 today means you’re paying for results over a decade in advance. PLTR stock trades at almost 180 times forward earnings. Even on a free cash flow basis, you’re paying in excess of 130 times FCF. In comparison, NVDA stock trades at 25 times forward earnings with stronger and more durable sales growth. A software company like Palantir is not in the intersection of the AI infrastructure buildout and mostly relies on an increasing number of customers. The company can scale once it gets its foot in the door, but there’s only so much market it can capture. Analysts thus expect sales growth to come down a notch from ~54% for all of 2025 to ~42% in 2026. EPS growth is also expected to come down from 77% to less than 40% this year. In short, you may not be getting your money’s worth. The idea is that AI will be rapidly adopted across U.S. commercial companies, with Palantir being the “default” enterprise AI platform. This may allow it to grow much faster than expected, with Wall Street slapping an even higher premium. And the idea does have some meat to it. If the market was comfortable paying over 200 times forward earnings, 400, or even 500, may not look too ridiculous until the music stops. The most well-known analyst pushing this is Dan Ives from Wedbush, who believes Palantir can be a $1 trillion company within “two to three years”. He has advised investors to “triple down” on the stock. A lesser-known analyst, Will McGough from Prime Capital, also believes PLTR can reach a $1 trillion market cap. The likelihood of PLTR stock doubling in 2026 is minuscule. If the AI rally accelerates this year, PLTR Palantir can cross $200 again, and perhaps $250, but even with blockbuster earnings and an unceasing rally, doubling the market cap from here is unrealistic. The stock has been losing momentum, so a $1 trillion valuation in even two years is extremely unlikely at this point. Software AI stocks are seeing maturing valuations, and the market is likely to let the earnings catch up to the sky-high valuations first before slapping a bigger premium. The worst-case scenario would be if the AI rally ends this year. There’s plenty of profit to be taken, and the market will hurriedly punish the stock, especially if Palantir cannot sustain the beat-and-raise cadence for dozens of quarters as expected. All things considered, it is much safer to buy AI hardware stocks. For software AI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains my top bet. Our top personal finance-related articles today.
