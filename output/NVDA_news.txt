Full Content:
It was a rough week across Bitcoin mining and broader tech markets. Bitcoin mining stocks sold off alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other large-cap names, and hashprice flirted with cycle lows as bitcoin mining difficulty is still sky high. Against that backdrop, companies faced fires, hardware delays, product launches, and a fresh debate over custodial risk in Bitcoin lending. You are reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube Mining stocks fell sharply this week as part of a wider tech correction. “Everything is just getting absolutely destroyed right now,” Blockspace Founder Will Foxley said on the most recent Mining Pod, pointing out that bitcoin mining stocks have lost $20 billion in their collective market cap since October. (And they lost $8 billion this past Thursday alone). Hashprice is now hovering just above its all time low, which co-host Colin Harper described as “a clear floor for where the average miner is right now in terms of their operating cost.” Hashprice–a measurement of Bitcoin mining revenue–recently tested around $40 per petahash per day, near its all time low, while network difficulty continues to trend higher, according to Luxor’s Hashrate Index. That combination leaves many pure play miners exposed and increases pressure to secure AI or high performance compute tenants to backfill power contracts. At the same time, the podcast hosts warn that phasing out Bitcoin mining too quickly to chase AI could shock revenue and disappoint equity investors. “If you phase it out too quickly, then you just lose a chunk of revenue,” Harper said, arguing that miners need a careful ramp if they want to keep balance sheets and shareholders intact. Bitdeer’s under construction Ohio site suffered an electrical fire that damaged two of 26 planned buildings after welding sparks ignited equipment inside one of the large metal structures. CEO Jihan Wu said on social media that crews were welding on site when sparks flew into the building and caused the blaze, a costly mistake even if insurance covers much of the loss. The fire hit just as Bitdeer reported weak Q3 earnings, missing expectations on revenue and income, and as Wu skipped the earnings call while traveling to an event in Miami. The company also announced a $400 million convertible note, structured with call spreads to limit dilution but still expected to dilute shareholders by 2 to 4 percent. “Down 45 percent over the last five days, just an absolutely brutal drawdown,” Harper said, adding that Tether dropped some 7.7 million shares of Bitdeer from September to October. Bitcoin backed lending app Lava is under fire after a mandatory September update quietly changed how user funds are held. Lava originally launched as a discrete log contract (DLC)-powered lending platform where users locked Bitcoin into a DLC-based multisig, a model that drew users who wanted self custody and programmatic enforcement of loans. The recent app update prompted users to sign a transaction that moved their BTC from the DLC wallet on their phone to institutional cold storage that on chain sleuthing suggests is with Kraken, although Lava has not confirmed the custodian. Harper said users were told they were moving to a “new vault” but not that this vault used a completely different custodial model, calling it “a really bad look” for a sector already scarred by the fallout of last cycle’s leading crypto loan companies, BlockFi and Celsius. “You seem to have needed to move to a custodial cold storage model to lock lower interest rate credit,” Harper said, “but the way in which you went about it completely obliterated trust.” Auradine, one of the few U.S.-based Bitcoin mining hardware makers, announced its next generation TeraFlux miner. The rig can hit 9.8 joules per terahash in eco mode, in line with current generation machines from Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan according to the hosts. At standard settings it delivers around 310 terahash per second, or 240 terahash per second in eco mode, with efficiency closer to 11 joules per terahash when pushed for more hashrate. Auradine plans air cooled, hydro, and immersion variants, matching the current expectation that vendors ship multiple thermal configurations at launch. “I like to see the unit competitive against other manufacturers,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said, adding that broader support for non-Chinese manufacturers would help diversify supply. Private miner NYDIG and its parent Stoneridge continue to scale a vertically integrated mining strategy centered on oil and gas assets. This week, AFE Founder Brandon Davis shared his findings that Stone Ridge is lining up a $2.3 billion dollar acquisition of Eagle Ford, an oil and gas basis in South Texas. The Mining Pod hosts noted that this follows Stone Ridge’s planned purchase of Conoco Phillips assets in Oklahoma, and NYDIG’s pending buy out of Crusoe’s flared gas mining operations. With these moves, Stone Ridge appears to be building a portfolio that combines upstream energy, midstream services, and mining infrastructure under one umbrella. “What Bitcoin mining will survive in the U.S. will be at the energy level,” Harper said, arguing that Stoneridge’s growing oil and gas portfolio gives it a structural edge as other miners scale back. The show closed with a segment on Core Scientific and its key AI client CoreWeave. In a tense CNBC interview, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator framed delays at certain Core Scientific data centers in Texas and Oklahoma as a temporary construction issue and stressed that customer contracts and revenue are only pushed back by about one quarter. Markets were not convinced: CoreWeave shares are down about 50% from recent highs amid concerns that many “neocloud” providers will miss aggressive build timelines.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-these-wall-street-experts-expect-big-things-from-nvidia-earnings-report-next-week-11849946

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Title: Nvidia Reports Earnings Next Week. How Big of a Blowout Will It Be?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/11/14/nvidia-reports-earnings-next-week-how-big-of-a-blowout-will-it-be/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T15:32:00Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Monster Ztudio / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, powering data centers and enabling breakthroughs in generative AI. Over the past few years, the company has transformed from a graphics specialist into a tech powerhouse, with its stock surging amid the AI boom. Over the past five years, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates 90% of the time, sometimes by more than 30%, showcasing consistent outperformance. In the last four quarters, however, the chipmaker has averaged a beat of only 6.5%, likely due to analysts getting better at predicting its results. Investors are now laser-focused on Nvidia’s upcoming third-quarter results, set for release after market close on Nov. 19. Expectations run high, with Wall Street forecasting $54.83 billion in revenue and $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share — up 56% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. This pressure mounts as “whisper numbers,” the unofficial higher estimates circulating among traders, suggest Nvidia must deliver an even bigger surprise to avoid disappointing the market. Any miss could trigger a selloff, especially given its role as a bellwether for the broader AI sector. Nvidia’s success in the recent quarter likely stems from its commanding position in the AI ecosystem. As the primary supplier of GPUs for training large language models, the company has capitalized on demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the prior quarter, data center revenue hit record levels, driven by Blackwell chip ramp-ups and partnerships with AI innovators. These factors could push Q3 revenue toward or beyond the guided $54 billion, with analysts projecting 54% growth. On the bottom line, improved margins from economies of scale and software integrations, such as CUDA, may boost adjusted earnings to around $1.25 per share. Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for simulations has gained traction in industries like automotive and robotics, adding diversified revenue streams. Recent wins include expanded deals with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for cloud AI infrastructure, potentially contributing millions in incremental sales. Overall, these tailwinds position Nvidia for another strong showing, reinforcing its market cap lead on the S&P 500. Despite the momentum, setbacks could temper results. Nvidia faces ongoing restrictions on its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China. This “hangover” persists, with no H20 chip revenue in Q3, as CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed, and no expectation for that to change. While the company still sells less advanced tech, such as gaming and automotive chips, to Chinese customers, the loss of high-margin data center business — previously a key growth driver — may cap upside. Analysts estimate this could shave several billion off potential revenue. Additionally, hedge fund manager Michael Burry’s bearish put options on Nvidia, revealed last week, sparked a 7.2% stock drop, signaling concerns over AI hype and valuation risks (Burry just announced he was closing his Scion fund and returning investor funds because he no longer understood AI market valuations). Broader market dynamics, including competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a coming cash crunch, add uncertainty. If demand softens or supply chain issues arise, these could pressure margins and lead to a guidance miss for Q4, where Wall Street expects $61.33 billion in revenue. Nvidia’s earnings next week could indeed be a blowout, given its 90.5% beat rate over the last 21 quarters and robust AI demand. However, smaller recent beats and China restrictions raise the chance of a negative surprise if results fall short of whisper numbers or its guidance disappoints. In the last three earnings announcements in February, May, and August, Nvidia’s stock has briefly declined twice afterward, underscoring potential post-report volatility. Long-term investors might buy before results if they are confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals — which otherwise seem solid — but risk-averse ones might wait for clarity on guidance. The chipmaker’s stock is down 12% from its all-time hit above $212 at the end of October, and its shares have fallen in the past few sessions. CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) just shocked the market with news of a data center partner’s buildout delay and we may see other AI stocks run into similar situations as the race for scarce resources heats up. The prudent choice just might be to take a wait-and-see approach before diving in.

Title: The Shutdown Is Over. Winter Is Usually Good For Stocks. Here's Why Investors Are Selling.

The stock market cleared a major hurdle this week. It's the outset of what is historically a good time for equities. You wouldn't know it if you looked at your portfolio today. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation to reopen the federal government, ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reopening removes the economic drag from more than 1 million federal workers going without pay and clears a path for federal agencies to once again release vital economic data. Yet stocks were falling Thursday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which finished the day down more than 2%—perhaps a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, since stocks rallied on Monday as an end to the shutdown looked imminent. AI optimism and expectations for rate cuts have been two of the primary drivers of stock returns this year. If either AI or the Federal Reserve fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, stocks may be vulnerable to correction. Historically, the end of a shutdown has supported stocks, according to Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist at LPL Financial. Since 1976, he wrote Wednesday, covering 20 shutdowns, the S&P 500 has risen more in the one- and three-month periods after a budget resolution than in all other comparable periods. This shutdown is also ending at a time of year that’s historically good for the stock market. Since 2000, November has, on average, been the best month of the year for the S&P 500. December, another positive month, is more often than not capped off with a Santa Claus rally. But the mood on Wall Street heading into the end of the year appears more dour than rosy, with investors debating the existence of an AI bubble and uncertain what incoming economic data will say about the health of the economy. The debate about an AI bubble has taken a toll on tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) slid 7% last week, and were down more than 3.5% on Thursday. Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.
