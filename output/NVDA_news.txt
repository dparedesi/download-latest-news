Tech stocks pulled back in early trading Friday, hitting the brakes on the market’s rally in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s supersized rate cut this week. The S&P 500 was down about 0.4% Friday after hitting record highs Thursday, with the energy and industrials sectors leading broad-based declines and its tech sector down about 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.6%. Semiconductor stocks including Onsemi (ON), ASML (ASML), and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), were among the stocks leading losses on the major indexes, pulling the PHLX Semiconductor Index down 2%. The Magnificent 7 stocks were mixed. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) lost ground, while Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) were slightly higher. Apple (AAPL) advanced as its iPhone 16 hit stores. Some analysts have suggested this week’s cut could set the stage for tech stocks to gain over the last few months of the year and into next year, with Wedbush analysts writing yesterday that “the green light is back on for the tech growth trade.” While the Fed cautioned this week against assuming more jumbo cuts lie ahead, markets are largely expecting the central bank to continue aggressively cutting rates this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool based on fed funds market data.

Title: 4 Things Investors Must Know About AI

Time Published: 2024-09-20T00:29:03Z

Last week was quite an important week for tech and AI investors, with Goldman Sachs hosting its Communacopia and Technology Conference featuring executives from the largest tech and semiconductor companies. Rarely have so many tech CEOs gathered to discuss their thoughts on AI, where the industry currently stands, and what lies ahead. To have the CEOs of trillion-dollar companies speaking in unison on AI’s potential and investing in AI is either a staggering coincidence — or they have important insights pointing to the same conclusion, which is that AI’s primary risk is for companies who are not early enough to capture it. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... [+] Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) We’re still in the early innings of AI, but the pace of transformation that AI is driving is unlike any other technology seen before, and that was evident at Communacopia. Below, I dig in to the four things that investors must know about AI. The AI revolution has arrived, sparked in full-scale by Nvidia’s Hopper series GPUs and OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Not even two years later, Nvidia continues to sell GPUs at an unbelievable clip, with Big Tech unable to procure enough GPUs to meet internal project needs and external enterprise demand in the cloud. AWS CEO Matt Garman explained that he truly believes AI “is a technology that over time is going to completely change almost every single industry that all of us focus on and think about and work on every single day to some level.” Garman added that the early AI use cases we’re seeing proliferate at the moment are just scratching the surface. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott agrees, stating that he also believes “AI is the well spring of opportunity in the global economy.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed this, saying that “we're now in this computer revolution. … Generative AI is not just a tool, it is a skill. And so this is the interesting thing. This is why a new industry has been created. And the reason for that is, if you look at the whole IT industry, up until now, we've been making instruments and tools that people use. For the very first time, we're going to create skills that augment people. And so that's why people think that AI is going to expand beyond the trillion dollars of data centers and IT, and into the world of skills.” Despite the immense potential AI holds, in the present, the AI industry is only just at the nascent stages of this revolution. Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli explained that he thinks “it's still in the very early innings,” but “the reality is that very few are using it en masse today.” Bringing AI to the masses, when adoption of AI is commonplace, is when the industry will unlock things previously seen as impossible or extremely costly, according to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. Scott believes we could be 5 to 10 years out from seeing what developers are capable of and what applications can be created. By heralding in a new wave of innovation and unlocking endless possibilities to advance technology currently available today, AI is expected to have a multi-trillion-dollar impact on the global economy in the coming decades. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott discussed AI’s profound potential at Communacopia: “There are researchers that independently have said it will have an $11 trillion impact on the economy in the next handful of years. I believe that may be true. Maybe it's [$10 trillion], maybe it's [$9 trillion], maybe it's [$8 trillion], but it's going to be big. And the reason for that is there is so much inefficiency. There is so much waste. There is so much human potential that can be activated by taking the soul crushing work away from people and unleashing them to do things that really matter that can help companies grow and prosper. And that has never been factored into the equation as people think about technology on a day-to-day basis, that's why we're working so hard to tell them the story.” For context, the mobile economy, which delivered a handful of the trillion-dollar tech behemoths of today, added approximately $5.7 trillion to the global economy in 2023, up from $5.2 trillion in 2022, according to GSMA. McDermott sees AI having up to double the economic potential of mobile, though other industry forecasts point to a much larger long-term impact from AI. According to McKinsey, generative AI is estimated to add up to $7.9 trillion to the global economy annually when combining new generative AI use cases and gen-AI related productivity gains, according to research from McKinsey, Overall, McKinsey estimates the AI economy could add $25.6 trillion to global GDP over the next couple of decades. Generative AI is estimated to add up to $7.9 trillion to the... (truncated)
