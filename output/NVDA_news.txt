Bitcoin's strength persists as tech stocks surge and dollar weakens. The US stock market has opened to a sea of green on seemingly minor news. While President Trump’s call to Vladamir Putin to end the war in Ukraine could be seen as a potential ease to global tensions, the market appears to be responding primarily to a lack of trade war advancements. Markets love certainty and direction, with tariff volatility coming out of the US, Europe, and Canada; this Friday, traders seem optimistic that a reprieve is coming. The DXY dropped just 0.08% moments ago, which is correlated with Bitcoin’s decline of almost 1%. However, Bitcoin has held firm over the last day, outperforming the US market. Against a weakening US dollar, down 0.12% over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin’s relative strength is accentuated by a roughly 2% gain. It is significantly surpassing the Nasdaq, which is up 0.61% over the same timeframe. Yet Bitcoin remains range-bound, with prices fluctuating within a channel between $79,000 and $84,000. Tech equities broadly rallied at the market open, led by Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which gained 6.32%, and NVIDIA (NVDA), which went up 3.33%. Yet Bitcoin-linked investment vehicles, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), showed a parallel upward trajectory, reflecting broader investor interest in digital assets. Bitcoin’s positive divergence amid a mixed economic backdrop, characterized by modest dollar weakness and tech equity strength, indicates sustained market demand.

Stocks rebounded — after entering a correction yesterday — as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opted not to block a funding bill last night. That made it likely that the U.S. government won’t shut down this Saturday. Markets dipped briefly after consumer confidence weakened by ore than expected. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.7% as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing about 360 points, or 0.9%. The Magnificent 7 stocks all rose in trading. Palantir (PLTR) and Dell (DELL) also advanced. The preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading for March fell to 57.9, lower than both the consensus estimate of 64.0 and the final February level of 64.7. Stocks in focus today: CK Hutchison’s (CKHUY) ADRs fell 5.7%, following its Hong Kong-listed shares lower. China used state-controlled media to signal its displeasure with the conglomerate’s planned sale of its ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led (BLK) consortium, the WSJ reported. Beijing has refrained from official comment on the transaction. Docusign (DOCU) shares jumped 14% after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, even as its projections for future results fell short. Analysts pointed to signs of growth, Barron’s reported. Li Auto’s (LI) ADRs climbed even after the Chinese maker of electric vehicles said its revenue will probably fall this quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF) said it’s seen no slowdown in demand for servers it assembles for Nvidia and expects AI-related demand to double this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The company, also called Foxconn, expects total revenue to grow this year. Ulta (ULTA) stock gained 7.7% after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results — and despite its projection for the current period falling short of analysts’ projections.

Title: Nvidia Stock To $60?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/14/nvidia-stock-to-60/
Time Published: 2025-03-14T09:00:34Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. NVDA Stock Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 60% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock experienced a sell-off, dropping from approximately $148 in mid-January to around $115 now, which represents a nearly 23% decrease. This decline has been fueled by several factors, such as the introduction of more resource-efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek and worries that decelerating investments in generative AI might reduce the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Additionally, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Separately, see Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track? Here’s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, NVDA stock might incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 indicates that NVDA stock lost more than 60% of its value in only a few quarters. Currently, Nvidia stock has decreased from $148 to $115 in roughly two months. This raises the question: could the stock continue its downward trend and reach approximately $60 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception. Slowdown in AI Demand: Over the last two years, companies have significantly invested in training AI models, with Nvidia’s GPUs becoming the preferred option due to their performance and efficiency. The short-term outlook remains robust, as tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are increasing capital expenditures for 2025 to expand their AI cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, demand may eventually taper off. Since AI model training is predominantly a one-time, compute-intensive process, it could eventually decelerate. As models increase in size, incremental performance improvements are anticipated to diminish, and the supply of high-quality training data might become a limiting factor. Consequently, as the demand for training declines, GPU sales could also decrease. Therefore, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture, the U.S. economy might enter a downturn, potentially even a recession, which could further affect GPU sales. Because AI investments continue to be unprofitable for most companies, they may be prime candidates for cost-cutting measures during an economic downturn. This situation could significantly impact Nvidia. The transition to more resource-efficient AI models could also affect Nvidia. China’s DeepSeek model, launched in January, attracted attention for prioritizing software-driven optimization instead of relying on hardware, which could potentially reduce the demand for GPUs. The company reports that it spent only $5.5 million to train its V3 model, which is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions that firms such as OpenAI are said to have spent. Since DeepSeek’s model is open source, major tech companies might adopt similar cost-cutting strategies. If this approach is widely implemented, it could further reduce the demand for AI computing power. For further information, see how DeepSeek impacts Nvidia The U.S. government has imposed export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s latest AI chipset products destined for China, with the exception of the H20 chips, citing national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are using entities registered outside of China to purchase servers equipped with Nvidia’s latest products from companies in various countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is particularly concerning as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, generating approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25 (around 18% of revenue), compared to only $2.3 billion (8% of revenue) in FY’23. Singapore has now initiated an investigation into these potential loopholes. Such developments could potentially affect Nvidia’s overall revenue to some degree. For further details, see how Trump’s tariffs affect Nvidia stock. NVDA stock has experienced a decline that was marginally more severe than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Are you concerned about how a market crash might affect NVDA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and following previous market crashes. • NVDA stock declined by 62.7% from a peak of $30.12 on 3 January 2022 to $11.23 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, it has risen to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $115 • NVDA stock dropped by 37.6% from a high of $7.87 on 19 February 2020 to $4.91 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 11 May 2020 • NVDA stock declined by 85.1% from a high of $0.99 on 17 October 2007 to $0.15 on 20 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 13 May 2016 NVIDIA’s Revenues have soared, increasing at an average rate of 80.1% over the past three years, which is significantly higher than the 6.3% increase in S&P 500 revenues. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s valuation remains attractive given its strong growth, with the stock trading at approximately 26x consensus FY’26 earnings. Yet, there are some potential risks. In recent quarters, net margins have exceeded an impressive 50%, propelled by robust pricing power and high demand for AI chips. Still, these margins could be at risk if demand declines or if competition intensifies. A slowdown in demand could result in reduced pricing, lower sales volumes, and a significant decline in profitability. As an aside, check out the large move in this quantum computing stock in What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Considering the potential for a slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Will you continue holding your NVDA stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $70, $60, or even lower prices? Maintaining a position in a declining stock is always challenging.

March 13, 2025 09:04 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) groundbreaking enhancements to NVIDIA RTX™ neural rendering technologies. NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to bring neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview in April, giving developers access to AI Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs to accelerate neural networks from within a game’s graphics pipeline. Neural shading represents a revolution in graphics programming, combining AI with traditional rendering to dramatically boost frame rates, enhance image quality and reduce system resource usage. “Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,” said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. “This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.” In addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit, a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features. Enabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements — such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more — will be available on Tuesday, March 18. NVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available. RTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5The number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles. As ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today’s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5. At the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its “Zorah” technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination. Return to ‘Half-Life 2’ With RTX DemoThe official release of RTX Remix — featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades — lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates. A year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies. Over 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios’ Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Half-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18. The remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics. Over 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out NowDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time. DLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates. In addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.

Intel (INTC) stock jumped more than 12% in after hours trading on Wednesday after the chip manufacturer announced that tech executive and former board member Lip-Bu Tan will be the company’s new chief executive officer, effective March 18. “Tan is a longtime technology investor and widely respected executive with more than 20 years of semiconductor and software experiences as well as deep relationships across Intel’s ecosystem,” the company said in a press release. Tan was formerly the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), where he more than doubled the company’s revenue and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%. He was also on Intel’s board for two years until his departure in August 2024. “Lip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” Frank D. Yeary, independent chair of the board who had taken upon the role of interim executive chair during the CEO search, said in the company’s press release. Tan will be taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and MJ Holthaus. The duo had replaced former CEO Patrick Gelsinger was ousted in December 2024 following a rocky period for the once-dominant chip company. The chipmaker has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions, and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, although nothing has been announced. Tan shared that he was “honored to join Intel” as CEO. “Intel has a powerful and differentiated computing platform, a vast customer installed base and a robust manufacturing footprint that is getting stronger by the day as we rebuild our process technology roadmap,” Tan said in the press release. Intel had a great trading day on Wednesday. The stock ended the day up more than 4% after a Reuters report broke that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) had approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s foundry division.

Title: Stocks will be volatile until the cost of Trump's tariffs become clear, strategist says

Investors will need to have a sense of the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs before the U.S. stock market finds a bottom, Empower’s chief investment strategist said, as reflected in the modest rebound in stocks after today’s better-than-expected CPI report. “I read the day one executive order on trade — it struck me that these tariffs are permanent features, not a negotiating tactic,” Marta Norton told Quartz. “The impact of the tariffs aren’t as easy to trace as you might think,” as shown by the now-suspended levies on the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S. Trump has injected a lot of uncertainty into markets with the tariffs, and expect a lot of volatility until that’s digested, Norton said. Even after the recent selloff, U.S. stock valuations remain high by historical standards, so there’s a lot of room for equities to decline. The S&P 500 was up about 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average about 66 points, or 0.2% as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq did better, up about 1.6%, led by gains in Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and chip stocks. Intel (INTC) gained after Reuters reported that TSMC (TSM) approached Nvidia, AMD (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) to set up a joint venture to run Intel’s chip foundries. The trade war won’t be helpful for inflation — every little bit counts when seeking to slow price gains — but the impact isn’t straightforward, according to Norton. For example, construction costs will probably rise because of duties on construction materials, but that may not affect shelter prices. The uncertainty means that the slide in U.S. equities may not represent a buying opportunity, especially given that valuations remain above average. “We’re hardly in 2022 again,” Norton said. “Maybe if you’re underweight it’s time to increase exposure, but not sure I’d be doubling down otherwise.” The selloff may not trigger an about face from Trump, given praise from unexpected quarters, including some labor unions. Norton said. “It struck me that there’s a distinction on what the investment community thinks and what Trump’s audience is — investors may not be Trump’s audience on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir and chip stocks led a Nasdaq rebound on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite index ended the day with a 1.22% gain, following a February CPI report showing that inflation slowed more than expected last month. The rebound was more muted in the rest of the market, with the S&P 500 up only about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.2%. Tesla closed up 7.6% at a little over $248 a share, Nvidia ended the day up 6.43% to close at $115.74 a share. This followed a particularly rough start to the week, as investors became increasingly worried about the effects of President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies. Tesla stock, in particular, has been on a steady decline amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and his work to slash government spending through the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Protests against the company’s showrooms and facilities, as well as vandalism of Tesla cars, have increased recently. In response, Trump on Tuesday brought five Teslas to the White House’s southern lawn, including a cherry red Model S which he ended up purchasing. Also on Tuesday, Musk shared in an X post that Tesla would commit to doubling its vehicle production in the U.S. over the next two years. Tech giant Palantir (PLTR) was another winner of Wednesday. Palantir shares ended the day up 7.18%, closing at $83.65 a share after the company announced late Tuesday that it will be hosting its sixth Artificial Intelligence Platform event on Thursday. Chip stocks were also up following news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s (INTC) foundry division. TSMC would run the operations, but would not own more than 50% of the assets, according to Reuters. Earlier in March, the White House announced that TSMC plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Intel gained 4.56%, TSMC 3.63%, AMD 4.17%, and Broadcom ended the day up 2.18% Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks extended gains in premarket trading on Wednesday after an encouraging inflation report, indicating a possible rebound after the selloff on Monday and Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained about 1%, S&P 500 futures rose 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.7% at about 8:45 a.m. in New York The CPI increased 0.2% in February from January, less than consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, and slowing from the prior month’s 0.5% gain. Annual headline and core inflation eased slightly to 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively, also slightly slower than projected. Economists diverge on whether sticky inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold this year, with some expecting no interest rate cut at all and others expecting up to three rate reductions as the labor market slows amid increased uncertainty driven by Trump’s economic policies. Helping matters: President Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon canceled his doubling of tariffs on Canadian-made steel and aluminum to 50% after Premier Doug Ford of Ontario agreed to suspend a charge on electricity sent to the U.S. following a conversation with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Stocks to watch today: Intel (INTC) stock jumped 5.2% premarket after Reuters reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) approached Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) about forming a joint venture to run Intel’s foundry division. TSMC wouldn’t own more than 50% of the joint venture, the newswire said. Nvidia stock gained 4.1% in premarket trading, leading most other Big Tech companies higher. Apple (AAPL) shares reversed early declines to edge slightly higher. Palantir (PLTR) stock gained 6.2% Tesla (TSLA) stock gained about 5.9% in premarket trading, extending Tuesday’s rebound after Monday’s 15% selloff. iRobot (IRBT) stock plunged 36% after raising a “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue operating, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Quantum computing will be useful in the next 4 years: IBM chief
URL: https://qz.com/quantum-computing-will-be-useful-in-the-next-4-years-i-1851769272

Quantum computing has the potential to greatly accelerate breakthroughs in everything from pharmaceuticals to predicting stock market behavior — and these advances could be right around the corner, according to IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna. Artificial intelligence is all the rage in the tech industry, but the current generation of AI won’t get the industry to an all knowing artificial general intelligence model, Krishna said on Tuesday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Breakthroughs are instead expected to come from AI working in complement with quantum computing. “AI is learning from already produced knowledge, literature, graphics and so on, it is not trying to figure out what is going to come,” Krishna said. Quantum computers instead work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. Quantum computing technology, when achieved in full, has the potential to be much faster than regular computers and could go beyond what AI systems can provide to give insights into “how nature behaves,” the IBM chief said, particularly on a sub-atomic level. “Once we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that is in existing knowledge,” Krishna said. The industry’s belief in how fast quantum computing technology can scale up has wavered recently. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg claimed that useful quantum computers are 15-30 years away, which tanked quantum computing stocks like IonQ (IONQ) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI). Although the technology has more progress it needs to count, Krishna believes that quantum computing is “going to surprise you before this decade is up.” He isn’t the only person to believe this either. Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates told Yahoo Finance last month that quantum computing could become useful in as soon as 3 to 5 years. And there have been recent advancements in quantum computing, most notably in December when Google (GOOGL) unveiled its latest quantum chip Willow. Google claims the chip will greatly reduce error rates, one of the greatest challenges plaguing quantum technology. On the other hand, the biggest problems facing AI, according to Krishna, are a lack of domain specificity — in depth knowledge of particular fields or application areas — as well as the technology’s notorious energy intensity. “I’ll predict for you that five years from now, most of the models are going to be using 1% of the energy of what they’re using today,” Krishna said. “I think DeepSeek gave us a preview.” Quantum computing, while still costly, has the potential to be less energy intensive than AI data centers. Krishna also said that IBM is working on building practical use cases for the technology, not just investing in making the quantum computing hardware. “In the end, to me, value in technology is not derived from the invention. Much as we love the invention, value is derived from people using it,” Krishna said. “Sometimes, when we get ahead of ourselves, we get too focused on the invention and not on making sure that there are hundreds and thousands of different companies, private and public, that are using it. So that’s what we’re trying to get done in this case and I think we’re kind of going at the right pace in this instance,” he added. Industry leaders will be getting together on March 20th for Nvidia’s (NVDA) first “Quantum Day,” at the tech giant’s GPU Technology Conference to discuss where quantum computing is headed.

Title: DeepSeek's founder isn't interested in investors for now

Artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rattled the industry earlier this year — but its founder is reportedly not interested in bringing in outside capital just yet. DeepSeek’s founder Liang Wenfeng isn’t rushing to find investors who would interfere with his control and the company’s decisions, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Liang reportedly also is wary of stakeholders involved with the government due to fears that it could hamper DeepSeek’s global efforts. Since its AI models sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street in January, DeepSeek has received interest from China’s tech giants, including Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA), over potential collaborations, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company has also reportedly been offered a low-interest loan from the state-owned Bank of China (BACHY). After DeepSeek released results in January demonstrating that its open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, can perform comparably to those from OpenAI on several industry benchmarks, it sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks. In December, the company released its DeepSeek-V3 models, which it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA) H800 chips — a reduced-capability version of the more powerful chips that U.S. firms have touted spending tens of billions of dollars on. Amid the hype over R1, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store downloads. The DeepSeek site experienced outages due to the influx of new users, and the company had to issue a temporary limit on registrations after “large-scale malicious attacks.” Since then, DeepSeek has continued to experience service outages from an overabundance of users, and has come under scrutiny by the U.S. and other countries over data security risks. Last month, DeepSeek published its techniques for training its AI models with the H800 chips, and is planning an April release for its next reasoning model, the Wall Street Journal reported. DeepSeek’s AI models are currently mostly available for free. Before its success, DeepSeek had sought venture capital funding, but was turned down, the Wall Street Journal reported. Now, the company is reportedly looking to work with larger tech firms to develop commercial AI applications. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Dow drops 550 points as Trump shrugs off a market rout and says more tariffs are coming

Stocks ended lower on Tuesday, extending Monday’s rout, as President Donald Trump doubled down on his trade war with Canada and a warning from Delta Air Lines sent many travel-related stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 478 points, or 1.1%, and the S&P 500 slid 0.8%. The Nasdaq closed down about 0.2% as a 1.7% rebound in Nvidia (NVDA) and gains in some other Big Tech stocks weren’t enough to save the day. Shares of Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) both declined. Trump escalated his dispute with Canada by saying he would double tariffs on the country’s aluminum and steel to 50% after Ontario enacted a levy on electricity it sends to the U.S. The administration remains confident of the long-term benefit of its economic changes, a spokeswoman said. “We are in a period of economic transition from that economic nightmare under a president who had no idea what he was doing, never held a private sector job in his life, into a golden age of American manufacturing,” Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House. One bit of good economic news came through on Tuesday: U.S. job openings rose to 7.74 million in January from a revised 7.51 million in December, a sign that the labor market was holding steady as President Joe Biden left office. The consensus estimate had been for 7.6 million openings. Tesla (TSLA) stock staged a modest comeback from yesterday’s 15% plummet, rising 3.8%, as Trump said he’d buy one of Elon Musk’s EVs. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock fell 7.3% after the company cut its first-quarter profit and sales forecasts on weaker domestic travel demand. It retained its full-year outlook. American Airlines (AAL), Expedia (EXPE), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Hilton (HLT) and Airbnb (ABNB) shares also declined. Disney (DIS) fell 5%, extending its recent decline. Retailers also got pummeled. Kohl’s (KSS) plunged 24% after its quarterly earnings missed consensus and its projections also fell short. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) fell 5.7% after a disappointing earnings outlook outweighed better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock, by contrast, jumped 8.3% after the carrier said it will abandon its free-bags policy for most passengers, which analysts said will boost revenue but will also damage its brand and erode customer loyalty. Oracle (ORCL) dropped 3.1% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields. CEFs Outperform Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further. STK Total Returns Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain. CEF Premiums Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out. Swappable CEFs See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Notable reports expected this week include: These data points will be closely monitored, as they could influence the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates and shape investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve has been working to tame inflation after it peaked above 9% in 2022. Despite some progress, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. If Wednesday’s CPI data shows continued inflationary pressure, the Fed may consider maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period. A cooling labor market and slowing economic growth add complexity to the Fed’s decision-making. Policymakers must balance curbing inflation without triggering a deep recession. With Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, spending cuts, and stricter immigration policies—shaping future economic conditions, the Fed’s next steps will be closely scrutinized.

Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a “period” of transition from the policy changes he’s making. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will “burn” Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR) stock also declined. Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure. Here are some stocks to watch today: Airbnb (ABNB) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company’s durable growth and its addition of an “experiences” category. Bally’s (BALY) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company’s shares. Cognizant (CTSH) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm. Coinbase (COIN) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported. Crowdstrike (CRWD) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company’s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week. All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets. Doordash (DASH) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company’s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices. IBM (IBM) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR’s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn’t comment on the decision. Microchip Technology (MCHP) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that’s been exacerbated by the chipmaker’s falling revenue and weak margins. Oracle (ORCL) will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Monday. The software giant’s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth. Consensus estimates call for profit of $1.49 per share and revenue of $14.38 billion. The stock fell 4.6% in morning trading ahead of the report. Harri Weber contributed to this report.

Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street’s fears tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,” Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, “are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.” The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears. The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged. Goldman Sachs (GS) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase. On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn’t rule it out as a potential outcome. “I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market’s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has “just become hooked” on government spending and that “there’s going to be a detox period.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn’t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn’t affect federal policy. —Josh Fellman contributed to this article.
