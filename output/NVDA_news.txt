Stock market rally today has captured Wall Street’s attention as the Dow Jones jumped 500 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posting strong gains. This sharp rebound follows a weak U.S. payroll report, which has increased hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts as early as September. With only 73,000 jobs added in July and unemployment ticking up, investors now expect multiple interest rate cuts by the end of 2025. President Donald Trump’s strong reaction to the data, including the firing of the BLS chief, adds political drama as markets shift.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings: Magnificent 7 Outperform Growth Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/03/second-quarter-earnings-magnificent-7-outperform-growth-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-08-03T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the second busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 124 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CVX), and Walt Disney (DIS). The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) released better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks. All the details about Berkshire’s quarterly earnings are here. According to FactSet, 82% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 66% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.3% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.9%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.8%. Despite the better earnings results, the S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week, with jobs, increased tariffs, and escalating tension with Russia weighing on the index. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to blowout earnings from Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) reported robust earnings growth, which also continued to reinforce the artificial intelligence earnings narrative. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) also beat consensus estimates by a healthy margin with their earnings reports, but both stocks traded lower last week on concerns about the outlook. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the last of the Magnificent 7 to report results, scheduled for August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the healthcare, consumer discretionary, and technology sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. While the first-quarter headline GDP understated the underlying trend of the US economy, the second-quarter headline GDP number overstates the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they slowed to a 1.2% pace after the 1.9% growth in the first quarter. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the US private sector. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by a below-consensus 73,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. There was a shockingly significant downward revision in payroll jobs over the previous months, chopping off 258,000 jobs from what was previously reported. Downward revisions, especially of this magnitude, are a sign that the labor market is cooling. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The deterioration in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market is softening. While one should not jump to conclusions after one ugly month, it should be monitored closely for a continuation of the downtrend. The weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits have deteriorated slightly, indicating that the unemployed are having a harder time finding another job. Still, it has been a slow leak rather than a collapse so far. It is the second busiest week of earnings season, before earnings reports slow markedly next week. The shockingly soft monthly jobs report on Friday sent the odds of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) soaring. Markets are currently pricing in an 87% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. There aren’t any top-tier economic releases next week, but Fedspeak will be monitored closely for any reaction to the monthly payroll report. Last week, President Trump announced new reciprocal tariff rates for countries not yet reaching a trade deal with the US. Generally, these new tariff rates become effective on August 7. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. More sectoral tariffs could also be forthcoming. After hitting an all-time high last Monday, stocks retreated in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report, increased tariffs, and escalating geopolitical tension with Russia. Stocks had been boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. While the earnings story continues, particularly in the AI-related technology space, an increase in the odds of recession weighed on risk appetite.

Title: 6 Top Growth Stocks To Buy For August 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-growth-stocks-to-buy-august-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-02T13:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Bullish about stocks for the rest of 2025? You’re not alone. Even as the August 1 start date for higher tariffs has arrived, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trending up and flirting with new highs. Plus, analysts from Oppenheimer Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets have raised their 2025 S&P 500 targets. When market optimism is high, growth stocks can pad your wealth quickly. Let's meet six top growth stocks that deserve a closer look. The best growth stocks to buy for August are S&P 500 constituents that meet these criteria: The resulting stock list was ordered from highest to lowest EPS growth expectation, and the top six were chosen for inclusion. The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

Enterprise and cloud giants are rapidly adopting these chips, leading to supply outpacing demand.
