Reports of a potential acquisition helped shares of a utility company power higher, while an agricultural sciences firm faced pressure after it announced a plan to separate into two independent entities. Major U.S. equities indexes recovered from early losses to end higher on the first trading day after a federal government shutdown took effect. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow eked out a 0.1% gain to finish at all-time highs. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4% to finish just short of its closing record. Find the full market summary from Investopedia here. Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever. Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all ranked among the benchmark index's top performers Wednesday. Shares of memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI. Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026. Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business. Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812
Time Published: 2025-09-30T22:39:30Z
Full Content:
After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: The 10 Strongest-Performing Mega-Cap Stocks Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/30/the-10-strongest-performing-mega-cap-stocks-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-30T17:53:23Z
Full Content:
ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.
