The head of a $210 billion asset management firm has decided to unload a massive pile of assets. Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of bluechip stocks Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Time Published: 2024-12-06T22:53:29Z

The shocking killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson this week has shined a light on the security concerns facing corporate leaders and the myriad expenses their companies pay to protect them. Meta (META), for example, shells out a staggering $24.4 million every year on personal security and travel for its CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives. Such costs are appropriate and necessary “in light of the threat landscape,” said the company in its most recent proxy statement. Tesla (TSLA), too, spends millions on security for its CEO Elon Musk, who in recent years has become increasingly concerned about attacks on his wellbeing. The EV maker spent $2.4 million last year to hire a security company for its billionaire leader. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Thompson, who was murdered earlier this week in New York City, headed an insurance subsidiary of UnitedHealth. The parent company didn’t break out any details regarding executive security perks in its 2023 proxy statement, although it noted that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty is required to use corporate aircraft during business travel for security reasons. Security costs across S&P 500 companies have risen substantially in recent years, according to data from Equilar, an executive data compensation research firm. The median value of security expense perks doubled from $47,643 in 2021 to $98,069 by 2023, with the share of companies providing such arrangements for named executive officers increasing by 23.5 percent to 27.5 percent. Here’s a look at what some of the world’s largest tech companies spend on security expenses for their top executives: Meta, the highest S&P 500 spender on executive security perquisites, spent most of its security-related $24.4 million expenses in 2023 on CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He received $9.4 million in costs related to personal security at his residences and during personal travel, in addition to a pre-tax allowance of $14 million to cover additional personal security costs for Zuckerberg and his family. Meta also paid for security for a handful of other of other executives, including $903,139 for chief operating officer Javier Olivan. In 2023, Google (GOOGL)’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) spent almost $6.8 million on personal security services for Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. This makes the tech company the second biggest S&P 500 spender for the year on security perk expenditures, according to Equilar. Amazon (AMZN) spent a grand total of nearly $2.7 million in 2023 on security arrangements for executives including Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Douglas Herrington and Adam Selipsky. Security costs totaled at $1.6 million for Bezos, the company’s founder and executive chair, and $986,164 for CEO Jassy. The company also spent $22,631 on security for Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, and $51,636 on Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nvidia (NVDA) shelled out nearly $2.5 million in fiscal 2024 for its CEO Jensen Huang. These costs included $2.2 million residential security and consultation fees for Huang, in addition to security monitoring services and car and driver services. Apple (AAPL) spent around $820,000 last year on personal security services for its CEO Tim Cook. The company also spent more than $1.6 million on air travel expenses for Cook, a fee that included hourly flight charges, fuel charges, departure fees and landing fees. Due to Apple’s “global profile” and “the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO,” Cook is required to use private aircrafts for all business and personal travel. In December 2023, Tesla paid a security company owned by its CEO Elon Musk to provide services to Musk himself. These expenses totaled $2.4 million in 2023 and around $500,000 through February of this year, according to Tesla’s filings. Musk in July said in a post on his social platform X that two separate people had tried to kill him in the past eight months before they were arrested. In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) put $58,291 towards security-related costs and personal travel expenses for its CEO Satya Nadella. Providing such security services enables top executives “to focus on their duties to Microsoft while reducing security threats, and therefore, mitigate risks to our business,” said the company in a recent filing.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ooredoo is urgently seeking to acquire additional data centers to house Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) latest artificial intelligence chips, as highlighted by its chief executive, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Supported by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, the telecom company is aggressively increasing the capacity of its data centers and using strategic alliances to meet the rising demand for artificial intelligence-driven products. In June Ooredoo signed a major alliance with Nvidia to help this objective, therefore gaining access to the latest-generation graphics processing units. These GPUs will be housed across Ooredoo's 26 data centers spread throughout Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Tunisia, and the Maldives. By means of this alliance, Nvidia marks its first significant artificial intelligence deployment in the MENA area, therefore gaining access to markets from North Africa to South Asia. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ooredoo wants to employ these powerful Nvidia processors to meet the fast growing need for enhanced computing infrastructure, especially for generative artificial intelligence technology. Ooredoo has struggled to create new data centers fast enough to satisfy the growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure notwithstanding the strategic cooperation. The Wall Street Journal claims that right now the corporation is concentrating on acquisitions as a more practical way to handle these problems. Complementing its present 40-megawatt capacity, Ooredoo has pledged $1 billion to increase the capacity of its data center by another 2025 megawatts. With an eye toward giving governments, businesses, and startups throughout the region access to innovative AI resources, Ooredoo intends to almost treble its data center capacity by the end of the decade. Apart from its alliance with Nvidia, Ooredoo's Indonesian division, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, worked with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia in November to introduce Sahabat-AI, an AI language model ecosystem meant to support Indonesian languages. Designed in association with AI Singapore and Tech Mahindra, this project trains and improves AI skills using Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform. Along with its alliances, Ooredoo's strategic emphasis on data center acquisitions shows its dedication to propel digital transformation and innovation all throughout the MENA area. Using Nvidia's cutting-edge technologies and growing data center footprint will help Ooredoo position itself as a major participant in the AI and digital transformation scene and satisfy the fast growing needs for AI infrastructure.

Title: Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/06/sell-nvidia-buy-intel-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of Nvidia, which makes chips used to train artificial intelligence ... [+] technology, takes part in a press conference at the Government Office in Hanoi on December 5, 2024. (Photo by Nam NGUYEN / AFP) (Photo by NAM NGUYEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock surging by over 180% this year, pushing its valuation to close to $3.4 trillion. Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel’s revenues are expected to contract this year. But here’s the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that? Also see a crypto mover that is Up 300% In A Month, XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up. The markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia’s margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn’t be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. We explain below - the ‘why’. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia’s recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY’23 to almost $130 billion in FY’25. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet’s high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models - reducing demand for Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing. Now, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there’s certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share. During the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the “fear of missing out,” without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia’s biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business. While the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock’s Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher. Moreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel’s extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump’s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel’s status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts. Intel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel’s current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel’s improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. While Nvidia has returned outsized gains, in contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY’25 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia’s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company’s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that’s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.

Bitcoin (BTCUSD) crosses the $100,000 threshold on optimism over the nomination of a cryptocurrency advocate to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); U.S. stock futures are little changed after each of the major indexes closed at all-time highs; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reportedly is in talks with Nvidia (NVDA) to build Blackwell chips in Arizona; Five Below (FIVE) stock is jumping in premarket trading after the discount retailer raised its earnings outlook and named a new CEO; American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares are sinking after the retailer lowered its full-year guidance and warned of weak holiday sales. Here's what investors need to know today. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is soaring 4% to trade over $102,000 after President-elect Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. The surge comes after the cryptocurrency had come close to breaching $100,000 in November in a post-election rally, but later fell as low as $91,000 as investors took profits. The news also boosted other crypto-related assets and companies, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) all trading at least 5% higher in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are flat after each of the major indexes hit record intraday and closing highs Wednesday. Stocks are off to a strong start this month on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-growth policies. Market watchers are also eyeing the release of more corporate earnings Thursday, including from Kroger (KR) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and digesting remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Crude futures, gold futures, and 10-year Treasury yields are little changed. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) is in talks with Nvidia (NVDA) to produce the latter's Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at the contract manufacturer's plant in Arizona, Reuters reported. TSMC is preparing to start producing the AI chips early next year, the report said, but would still have to ship them to Taiwan for packaging. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of TSMC and shares of Nvidia are ticking higher in premarket trading. Five Below (FIVE) stock is soaring 14% in premarket trading, a day after the discount retailer appointed Forever 21's Winnie Park as its new CEO, effective Dec. 16, and raised its outlook for the year, noting "solid" Black Friday sales. Net sales for the year now are seen between $3.84 billion and $3.87 billion, up from $3.73 billion to $3.80 billion previously, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected between $4.78 and $4.96, raised from the prior range of $4.35 to $4.71. Third-quarter results also beat estimates. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are slumping 13% in premarket trading, a day after the clothing retailer's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter outlook came in below analysts' expectations. AEO reported a year-over-year revenue decline to $1.29 billion and profit that fell nearly 20% to $80 million. For the holiday quarter, AEO sees revenue down 4%, below estimates, which includes "a roughly $85 million impact from the combination of the retail calendar shift and one less selling week." JPMorgan subsequently downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight."

Title: TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona, sources say​

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Fanny Potkin TAIPEI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said. TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year. TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential. Two of the sources said Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said. All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 hit records as tech surges, Fed's Powell says economy in 'remarkably good shape'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A tech rally boosted US stocks on Wednesday, with all three major indexes hitting new record closes, as investors digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that US economy is in "remarkably good shape." The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed about 0.7%, or over 300 points, to close above 45,000 for the first time ever. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.6% for a fresh closing high of 6,086.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 1.3%, clinching a record of its own at 19,735.12. Cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) hit intraday all-time highs on Wednesday, as did iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) gained over 3%, nearing its own record. Salesforce (CRM) stock surged 11% after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its artificial intelligence products. Markets kept moving higher as Powell spoke at the New York Times DealBook Summit and did little to shake investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates at its December meeting. Powell touted a US economy in "remarkably good shape" as a reason he feels the Fed can be "afford to be a little more cautious" in its interest rate cutting path. The central bank is widely expected to lower rates at its Dec. 18 meeting. Traders see near 77% odds of a 25 basis point cut, compared with around 67% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. On that economic strength: A reading on private payrolls suggested the labor market is softening — but not too much. The report is one of several key economic releases this week, leading into the all-important monthly jobs report on Friday. In corporate news, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) halted its investor day after the CEO of insurance unit UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy All three major indexes clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday while bitcoin (BTC-USD) headed for a milestone of its own. The world's largest cryptocurrency quickly gained steam in the afternoon, nearly touching $100,000 per coin for the first time ever, as investors digested President-elect Donald Trump's nomination for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin's prior all-time high is $99,655.50 per coin. Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, who is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official. The former SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. The labor market has showed signs of further cooling in the second half of 2024. But there have still be an occasional signs of labor market tightness within data, as seen in a Wednesday release from ADP. New data from ADP released Wednesday showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers rose to 7.2% in November, up from 6.7% in October. Meanwhile, the year-over-year pay increase for job stayers rose to 4.8% from 4.7% the month prior, marking the first monthly increase in wage growth for job stayers in 25 months. "Job changers are the most sensitive to real time labor market conditions," ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told Yahoo Finance. "So if they're getting paid a little bit more in November than they did in October, that tells you that there's a labor market out there that's still a little tight. And that is meaningful to the fed." Specifically, Richardson added, it could be a challenge for a Fed that's already been digesting inflation prints that have shown little progress in recent months. "As long as you have sticky inflation and strong wage growth, you can't be on a preset course to cutting rates, because that could come and bite you later," Richardson said. "So I think they're still going to be very cautious, very data dependent." A rally in megacap tech helped lift US equities on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied more than 3% while Amazon (AMZN) popped more than 2%. All of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this week, with each stock rising more than 2% in the past three trading days compared to the benchmark index's less than 1% gain. We recently highlighted that these stocks have also been seeing stronger earnings revisions over the past month compared to the S&P 500, perhaps one of the driver's behind the recent market action. "US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings," DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a recent note. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that recent economic data could lead to a "cautious" interest rate-cutting cycle. In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell said the US economy is in "remarkably good shape." Given that, and how recent data has calmed concerns over how rapidly the US labor market is weakening, Powell believes the Fed won't need to rapidly cut interest rates while the central bank waits for inflation to fall to its 2% goal. "We can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," Powell said. Over the past few years, a stronger-than-expected US economy has continuously surprised Wall Street and its projections. While we've become somewhat used to them now, the recent underestimations are a reversal of what was seen prior to the pandemic when US economic forecasts were often too lofty, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Yahoo Finance. And now, heading into 2025, strategists like Calvasina are leaning into the post-pandemic trend and betting consensus economic forecasts will once again be surprised to the upside by the US economy. "Given that history recently of underestimating [US economic growth] and the fact that GDP forecasts for next year are creeping up very, very, very slowly, I'm making a bet on the 2% to 3% [growth] instead of the 1% to 2%," said Calvasina, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 6,600. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey issued the most bullish target on Wall Street at 7,007 while highlighting a "cyclical opportunity catalyzed by upward GDP revisions." If 2024's market driving abbreviation was AI, 2025's is set to be GDP. Read more here. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Atkins, currently the CEO at Patomak Global Partners, served as SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration from 2002 to 2008. Unlike his potential predecessor Gary Gensler, who is set to leave office in January 2025, Atkins is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official and currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. "He's certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro-digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry," Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) moved slightly higher on the news and was trading just north of $96,000 per coin in afternoon trade. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) touched intraday record highs on Wednesday as markets edged higher, buoyed by tech stocks. The S&P 500 Tech sector (XLK) outperformed, jumping about 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed after a strong quarterly report from software maker Salesforce (CRM). UnitedHealth Group (UNH) released a statement Wednesday following the fatal shooting in Manhattan of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson," read the company statement. "Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.” Thompson was shot outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where the company was holding its investor day. UnitedHealth halted the event this morning following the shooting. President-elect Donald Trump has asked Peter Navarro to be senior counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. Navarro served under Trump's first term as White House trade adviser. "I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing," wrote Trump on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. "During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American," wrote Trump. Amazon (AMZN) hit an all-time high on Wednesday amid the company’s AWS re:Invent 2024 cloud conference. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant rose more than 2% in early trading. On Wednesday, numerous Wall Street analysts reaffirmed their bullish Buy ratings on the stock, citing the company's artificial intelligence capabilities. The stock has 77 Buy ratings, 5 Holds, and zero Sells. Amazon shares are up 43% year to date. Foot Locker (FL) shares tumbled 12% in early trading after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance while missing third quarter estimates, citing weak consumer demand. "Consumer spending trends softened following the peak Back-to-School period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated," the company said in its quarterly release. The stock is down more than 30% year to date. US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, as tech rose, led by shares of Salesforce (CRM). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.4%, or around 200 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3% on the heels of an all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.7%. Salesforce (CRM) stock climbed around 8% in early trading after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its AI products. Investors await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's appearance in New York on Wednesday afternoon.

World Labs, a startup co-founded by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li earlier this year that quickly grabbed the attention of high-profile investors, has remained relatively quiet on its products—until now. The startup yesterday (Dec. 3) provided a glimpse of one of its early projects, which takes the form of virtual 3D scenes generated from a 2D image. “This will change how we make movies, games, simulators and other digital manifestations of our physical worlds,” said World Labs in a blog post accompanied by interactive examples of its 3D worlds. The preview shines a light on Li’s larger efforts to develop A.I. models that have “spatial intelligence” and can understand and interact with the real world. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Based on images of landscapes, urban scenes and even artwork from painters like Vincent van Gogh and Edward Hopper, World Labs creates entire 3D worlds that users can explore—albeit with some barriers, such as a limit on how large the interactive area is. According to the startup, this 3D content provides more control than typical 2D A.I. content, as it allows users to adjust aspects like field of depth or play with camera dolly zooms. Often referred to as the “Godmother of A.I.” for her contributions to the field, Li in the 2000s played a large role in the release of ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that helped kickstart pivotal advances in machine learning. She is currently on partial leave from her role as co-director of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered A.I. to work on World Labs, which Li established earlier this year alongside fellow A.I. researchers Justin Johnson, Ben Mildenhall and Christoph Lassner. The startup in September raised some $230 million in a round led by Radical Ventures, a Canadian venture capital firm where Li serves as a partner, with the participation of Andreessen Horowitz and NEA. Other World Lab investors include “A.I. godfather” Geoffrey Hinton, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn (LNKD) co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, and Nvidia (NVDA)’s venture capital arm, NVentures. World Labs’ primary goal is developing the ability to take action with vision or perception within A.I. models—a type of intelligence that took 540 million years to evolve in the human brain. “If we want to advance A.I. beyond its current capabilities, we want more than A.I. that can see and talk. We want A.I. that can do,” Li said during a TED Talk in April. This week’s initial preview is just an early look at what World Labs hopes to eventually accomplish. The company said it has offered early access to its technology to digital content creators like Eric Solorio and Brittani Natali. “We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them,” said World Labs.

Title: Sam Altman isn't worried about Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump

Time Published: 2024-12-04T16:43:00Z

As his former colleague and artificial intelligence rival prepares for a role in the incoming Trump administration, Sam Altman says he’s not worried about Elon Musk. Despite there being “lots of things not to like about” Musk, it would go against the billionaire’s values to hurt competitors, the OpenAI chief executive said during an interview at the New York Times (NYT) DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “I may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reported that Altman and other tech and business leaders who have drawn Musk’s ire are worried about the influence he could have on regulation. Altman reportedly reached out to his connections in Trump’s circle, including the President-elect’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua Kushner, head of major OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. Altman also reportedly asked a mutual friend to set up a meeting with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 before leaving over a conflict of interest in 2018, announced in September that his AI startup, xAI, had brought “the most powerful AI training system in the world” online after only 122 days. The Colossus training cluster is powered by 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA) H100 training chips and “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H200 chips, Musk said. Altman said he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor” to OpenAI. “I have different feelings about him [Musk] now, but I’m still glad he exists,” Altman said. “Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think he, at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously.” Additionally, Altman said ChatGPT’s search feature is his “favorite product we’ve launched in a long time,” and that OpenAI will announce new launches and demos for the next 12 business days starting on Thursday.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. AI companies in Europe are competing with American counterparts for a larger slice of the AI cake in Asia and the Middle East. For example, French AI firm LightOn recently revealed plans to expand in the Middle East, targeting sectors such as banking, defense, and high-tech which require their data to be protected on local servers. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Laurent Daudet, the CEO of the firm, noted that banking, insurance, high-tech, defense, and healthcare were prime targets for the custom AI models from LightOn. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The report further highlights that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries were among those being looked at by LightOn. The AI firms just recently debuted on the stock market, becoming the first listed genAI company on the Euronext Growth exchange. The demand for LightOn products is growing.

Finance news expert Adam Clark recently opined in a piece for finance publication Barron’s that the focus of the AI industry will inevitably shift from training to inference as AI firms face challenges in their quest to build ever-larger AI models. This shift, per Clark, has big implications for NVIDIA. In his piece, the author noted that while training was uniquely suited to the company's GPUs, inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from NVIDIA peers like AMD and Intel, by custom chips from Amazon, or by a range of chip start-ups. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amazon's next-generation AI training chip is here

Amazon Web Services (AMZN) unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence training chip that it says is faster and expected to use less energy. Trainium3 is the first chip from AWS built with the 3-nanometer process — so far the most advanced semiconductor technology — that allows for better performance and power efficiency. The first Trainium3 chips are expected to be available late next year, AWS announced at its re:Invent conference on Tuesday. UltraServers powered with Trainium3 are expected to perform four times better than those powered by its Trainium2 chips, AWS said, “allowing customers to iterate even faster when building models and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” The cloud giant’s Trainium2 chips, which are four times faster than its predecessor, are now generally available, AWS said. The Trainium2-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances allow for 30% to 40% better price performance than current chips, and feature 16 Trainium2 chips. The new Amazon EC2 instances are “ideal for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters,” AWS said. The cloud giant said it is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trainium2-powered UltraServers with AI startup Anthropic called Project Rainier. In November, AWS announced it was following up a previous $4 billion investment in the AI startup with another $4 billion. In the next phase of the partnership, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary AI training partner. “Trainium2 is purpose built to support the largest, most cutting-edge generative AI workloads, for both training and inference, and to deliver the best price performance on AWS,” David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, said in a statement. “With models approaching trillions of parameters, we understand customers also need a novel approach to train and run these massive workloads. New Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS and help organizations of all sizes to train and deploy the world’s largest models faster and at a lower cost.” AWS chief executive Matt Garman also announced the next-generation P6 family of instances from Nvidia (NVDA) and AWS, featuring the chipmaker’s new Blackwell chips. Blackwell has 2.5 times faster compute than current generation of graphics processing units, or GPUs, Garman said.

Title: Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger may get more than $10 million in severance pay

Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:26:00Z

Outgoing Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to get paid as much as $10 million as he exits the struggling tech giant. Gelsinger will receive 18 months of his base annual salary of $1.25 million, or $1.8 million, and 1.5 times his target bonus of $3.4 million, or $5.16 million, which will be paid out over the next 18 months, Intel (INTC) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gelsinger will also receive a payment equal to 11/12ths of his 2024 bonus — which is subject to company performance — that he would have received had he not resigned. That would be a little more than $3 million. His departure comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) in the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest, including a potential takeover bid, as its performance has lagged. In early November, Intel was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to make room for Nvidia, which has been hailed as an “AI darling.” Intel’s stock has fallen by more than 52% in 2024 as of Tuesday, while its rival’s stock has surged by more than 188%. Although Gelsinger’s resignation was announced Monday morning, it came after what CNBC reports was a contentious board meeting over a lack of confidence in the CEO’s plans to compete with Nvidia. Gelsinger had served as the company’s first chief technical officer before leaving the company. He returned in 2021 to take over for then-CEO Bob Swan in an attempt to stabilize and modernize the company. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” he said.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: NVIDIA, Qualcomm And NXP Semiconductors

On 12/5/24, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and NXP Semiconductors will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. NVIDIA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 12/27/24, Qualcomm will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.85 on 12/19/24, and NXP Semiconductors will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.014 on 1/8/25. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $138.63, this dividend works out to approximately 0.01%, so look for shares of NVIDIA to trade 0.01% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 12/5/24. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.52% lower in price and for NXPI to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, QCOM, and NXPI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. NVIDIA: NVDA Qualcomm: QCOM NXP Semiconductors: NXPI In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.03% for NVIDIA, 2.09% for Qualcomm, and 1.74% for NXP Semiconductors. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, NVIDIA shares are currently up about 0.3%, Qualcomm shares are up about 2.8%, and NXP Semiconductors shares are up about 1.9% on the day.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025

Senior businessman in suit flying in private jet and listening to music via wireless earphones. If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.
