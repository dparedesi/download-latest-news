The integration is currently only on desktop, but is slated to launch on the MetaMask mobile app in the coming weeks, the company said. MetaMask is the Ethereum network's most popular browser wallet, with over 100 million annual users. — Tom Carreras Read more. SELF-SPREADING MALWARE FOUND IN PRIVACY CRYPTO DERO: A newly discovered Linux malware campaign is compromising unsecured Docker infrastructure worldwide, turning exposed servers into part of a decentralized cryptojacking network that mines the privacy coin Dero. According to a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, the attack begins by exploiting publicly exposed Docker APIs. In software terms, a docker is a set of applications or platform tools that delivers software in small packages called containers. Once access is gained, the malware spawns malicious containers. It infects already-running ones, siphoning system resources to mine Dero and scan for additional targets without requiring a central command server. As of early May, over 520 Docker APIs were publicly exposed over port 2375 worldwide — each one a potential target. — Shaurya Malwa Read more. FIFA TAPS AVALANCHE FOR OWN BLOCKCHAIN: FIFA, football’s global governing body, plans to use Avalanche’s network to power its own dedicated layer-1 blockchain. The FIFA Blockchain is an Avalanche L1, a customizable blockchain that uses Avalanche’s technology (previously known as a subnet). The news comes as the Avalanche network recently went through its major Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at attracting new developers and encouraging them to create customized L1s. Thursday’s announcement is not FIFA’s first foray into the world of blockchain and crypto. In 2022, the football body released a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Algorand blockchain ahead of the Qatar World Cup. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Nvidia is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, in what could be a major test of the AI trade’s resilience. Nvidia earnings are a blockbuster, market-moving event for Wall Street. Investors parse the results for any sign that AI demand or investment is waning, making the report a catalyst for AI infrastructure stocks. Most of these AI stocks are currently trading at or above their price heading into Nvidia's last earnings report at the end of February. Those results weighed heavily on the majority of AI beneficiaries. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and nuclear energy provider Vistra (VST) outpaced Nvidia’s (NVDA) 8.5% decline the day after its last report, tumbling 16% and 12%, respectively. Constellation Energy (CEG), also a nuclear power provider, slumped about 7.5%. Nvidia’s position as the world’s largest semiconductor company has made it something of a bellwether for the entire industry. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) tumbled more than 6% after Nvidia’s last report, its biggest decline since January’s DeepSeek panic caused the index to nosedive. Major Nvidia competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled 7% and 5%, respectively. Chip fabrication services provider Lam Research (LRCX) and memory chip maker Micron (MU) also closed sharply lower. The companies that supply data centers with essential networking equipment also tend to move on AI demand signals parsed from Nvidia’s earnings. Shares of Arista Networks (ANET) slid 5% following Nvidia’s February report, while fiber optic technology provider Corning (GLW) shed 2% and network provider Lumen Technologies (LUMN) dropped 4%. Granted, stocks within the AI ecosystem don’t always move in tandem. Nvidia shares soared more than 9% on its earnings report one year ago, but the boost its results lent to other AI infrastructure stocks fizzled out before the day’s end. Supermicro shares rose as much as 11% that day before sliding to close 3% lower.

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/28/2025 5:11:30 AM PDT by RoosterRedux Japan is reportedly planning to import nearly $7 billion worth of U.S.-made semiconductors in a move that could significantly benefit chipmakers like Nvidia Corporation amid ongoing trade negotiations with the Donald Trump administration. What Happened: Japan has proposed purchasing up to 1 trillion yen ($6.94 billion) in U.S. semiconductor products, reported Reuters via Asahi newspaper, which cited unidentified sources. The Japanese government would subsidize domestic companies that purchase the American chips, the report said. The plan is designed to help reduce the U.S.'s approximately 10 trillion yen trade deficit with Japan. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit the U.S. around May 30 for a fourth round of trade discussions, the report added. Why It's Important: Last month, shares of Nvidia and AMD encountered renewed pressure after the U.S. government imposed new restrictions on AI chip exports to China and several other areas. China continues to be a key market for Nvidia, with it contributing 13% of its revenue in the last fiscal year. However, CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year said that the company's market share in China has dropped sharply, from 95% prior to 2022 to just 50% now. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Title: Nvidia, AMD Could Stand To Gain Big Time As Japan Proposes $7 Billion Chip Deal In Trump Tariff Talks Amid China Export Curbs: Report

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/28/2025 5:11:30 AM PDT by RoosterRedux Japan is reportedly planning to import nearly $7 billion worth of U.S.-made semiconductors in a move that could significantly benefit chipmakers like Nvidia Corporation amid ongoing trade negotiations with the Donald Trump administration. What Happened: Japan has proposed purchasing up to 1 trillion yen ($6.94 billion) in U.S. semiconductor products, reported Reuters via Asahi newspaper, which cited unidentified sources. The Japanese government would subsidize domestic companies that purchase the American chips, the report said. The plan is designed to help reduce the U.S.'s approximately 10 trillion yen trade deficit with Japan. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit the U.S. around May 30 for a fourth round of trade discussions, the report added. Why It's Important: Last month, shares of Nvidia and AMD encountered renewed pressure after the U.S. government imposed new restrictions on AI chip exports to China and several other areas. China continues to be a key market for Nvidia, with it contributing 13% of its revenue in the last fiscal year.

The Japanese government would subsidize domestic companies that purchase the American chips, the report said. The plan is designed to help reduce the U.S.'s approximately 10 trillion yen trade deficit with Japan. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit the U.S. around May 30 for a fourth round of trade discussions, the report added. Why It's Important: Last month, shares of Nvidia and AMD encountered renewed pressure after the U.S. government imposed new restrictions on AI chip exports to China and several other areas. China continues to be a key market for Nvidia, with it contributing 13% of its revenue in the last fiscal year. However, CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year said that the company's market share in China has dropped sharply, from 95% prior to 2022 to just 50% now. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Title: The AI data center race is getting way more complicated
URL: https://qz.com/ai-data-centers-microsoft-amazon-electric-grid-land-1851782495
Time Published: 2025-05-28T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. There was just one problem with that analysis: The companies building these data centers say it’s wrong. Rather than signaling doubt about AI’s future, recent data center adjustments by Amazon and Microsoft reflect an industry confronting harsh realities: power grids that take years to expand, land speculators inflating prices sixfold, and utilities overwhelmed with requests for more electricity than actually exists. The question isn’t whether AI infrastructure demand is real — it’s whether the real estate market and power grid can handle what’s coming. A focus on each lease update from the tech giants reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the data center market operates, said Andy Cvengros, a 20-year data center industry veteran at JLL (JLL) who represents major tech companies in their real estate deals. Unlike typical real estate deals, hyperscalers work with the same partners across multiple markets and treat their portfolios holistically. That means cancellations in one location often coincide with expansions elsewhere. Moreover, the massive scale and long timelines involved make these adjustments routine business rather than strategic retreats. “This stuff happens all the time,” Cvengros said. “Whereas two years ago, nobody followed any of this.” Cvengros said that 75% to 85% of new data center capacity through 2029 is already pre-leased. These aren’t tentative commitments from struggling startups, but contracts with investment-grade hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon planning to spend more than $300 billion this year alone. The tech CEOs also reject the retreat narrative. Amazon’s Andy Jassy recently told shareholders they would be “very happy” with the company’s $100 billion AI infrastructure spending. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella dismissed data center adjustments as routine business that simply gets more attention now. “We’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build all through the last 10, 15 years,” Nadella said on an earnings call. “It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter-over-quarter nowadays.” That aligns with what Cvengros sees on the ground. Rather than pulling back, hyperscalers are “pausing to re-architect their strategy, ultimately to come back and continue doing what they’re doing in a large way,” he said. “We have not seen them slow down by any means.” The real constraint isn’t wavering demand but basic infrastructure. Power grids across the country are struggling (or failing) to keep up with AI’s explosive energy requirements. The scale of the challenge is unprecedented. In 2023, data centers consumed more than 4% of American electricity, and that could rise to 12% by 2028, according to the Department of Energy. New facilities are regularly requesting 500 megawatts or more — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes. In Virginia alone, the state’s largest utility has connected 75 new data centers since 2019, driving statewide electricity sales up 7% and prompting projections of 85% demand growth over the next 15 years. The tech industry is adjusting its buildout plans in response. “We are finding the best right sizing,” said Henrique Cecci, a Gartner (IT) analyst who tracks the data center market. Beyond infrastructure constraints, the data center sector is moderating its energy demand forecast, going from five- to six-fold growth expectations to a more realistic three- to four-times increase. “Nobody knows exactly how big AI is, but everybody agrees it’s a big thing,” Cecci said. The supply side tells a grimmer story. Utilities ordering necessary grid technology like combustion turbines today won’t receive them until 2029, according to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), an independent energy research institute. Traditional grid buildout takes four to seven years under normal circumstances, but supply chain bottlenecks have made the situation worse. Potential solutions are emerging. EPRI’s DCFlex project, launched last fall, is exploring how data centers can become grid resources rather than just consumers. “There is genuine interest in load flexibility among the data center community, particularly if it can reduce time to interconnect,” said Anuja Ratnayake, an emerging technologies executive at EPRI. The approach combines three flexibility elements: compute workloads that can shift timing, cooling systems that can modulate power use, and backup generators that can feed power back to the grid. Europe offers another model entirely. Vincent Weynandt of LuxConnect, Luxembourg’s government-backed data center operator, points to a more holistic approach that emphasizes sustainability from the start. “We try to be as sustainable as possible, but there needs to be willingness to invest in this kind of thinking,” he said. That planning approach contrasts with the reactive measures now emerging in the U.S., where some cities have imposed energy moratoriums and others have implemented new sustainability requirements from regulatory authorities. The restrictions reflect growing concern that data center growth is outpacing grid capacity and straining local power supplies. The difference in approaches reflects deeper philosophical divides, Weynandt said. “The U.S. always is a business approach first,” he said. “If I can squeeze like $1 more out of it, let’s take that dollar.” The pursuit of those extra dollars has fueled what JLL’s Cvengros calls the real bubble in data centers, and it has nothing to do with AI demand. “You have everybody and their mother trying to get in this data center game,” he said. “Whether it’s a farmer, somebody who owns land, private equity, or it’s a group who puts land under contract, they slap a power study on it, and then try to sell it for six times what it’s worth.” This frenzy has created a secondary market where developers acquire sites, add basic power studies, and flip them at massive markups. Each power study generates a formal request to utilities for grid capacity, creating an avalanche of applications. The situation has become so distorted that utilities now see 30 to 100 gigawatts of power requests in individual markets — far exceeding what’s actually available. The power crunch is forcing utilities to require massive upfront commitments. In markets seeing 30 to 100 gigawatts of power requests, companies must now put down deposits of $10 million to $30 million just to get in line for grid connections, Cvengros said. Those massive utility deposits aren’t just about power planning — they’re designed to reduce the speculation. “That is a bubble that will fall apart in the next 12 months, 24 months,” Cvengros said. Meanwhile, the hyperscalers with real business models continue their strategic building, working around the speculators when possible. They’re even buying entire neighborhoods, paying residents well above market rates to relocate. Cvengros recently helped a group acquire about 30 homes in one transaction, demolishing them to make room for data center expansion. This is happening more and more in core locations, such as Chicago’s Elk Grove Village, which are hitting the physical limits of where data centers could even fit. The solution isn’t retreat but expansion: Companies are moving outward to places like Illinois’ Yorkville and Aurora, or entirely new markets such as Columbus and Minneapolis. The industry has navigated major technological shifts before. When virtualization was introduced in the early 2000s, companies could suddenly consolidate dozens of physical servers into just a few machines, dramatically increasing efficiency. Data centers built in that era suddenly found themselves using only 10% to 20% of their footprint, Cvengros said. A similar adaptation could happen with AI infrastructure if efficiency improvements outpace usage growth. The emergence of vastly more efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek has already prompted industry discussions about whether massive buildouts are necessary, with some companies reconsidering the scale of their planned expansions. But the technology’s trajectory suggests otherwise. Nvidia’s (NVDA) roadmap shows future server racks will consume 600 kilowatts each — a 30-fold increase from the 10-20 kilowatt standard that prevailed for the past two decades. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has signaled that while chips will be more efficient, they’ll also be more powerful and require more energy, telling the industry to start building for higher power demands now. The demand is also shifting toward inference — running AI models for end users — rather than just training them. Unlike training, which happens in intensive but limited bursts to build models, inference runs continuously every time someone uses ChatGPT, asks Siri a question, or gets AI-powered search results. This usage pattern could multiply exponentially if AI applications reach broader adoption, creating sustained rather than cyclical demand for computing power. The companies navigating this transition successfully will be those with real business models and deep pockets, not land speculators. “We’re nearing a 2% vacancy nationally,” Cvengros said, describing an extremely tight market where serious operators continue building while speculation gets shaken out. “I don’t necessarily see a bubble popping.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility. Among the most popular ETFs offered on the platform are VUAA and SXR8 (S&P 500), the domestic AETF.GR, as well as thematic ETFs linked to oil, bonds and volatility. Greeks are strengthening their investment profile by making an investment shift to foreign stocks with an emphasis on ETFs and technology, choosing stocks such as Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and Google that are among their main international choices. In the domestic market, they prefer Metlen, OPAP, National Bank, Jumbo, Piraeus, Motor Oil, Alpha Bank and PPC. However, data shows that participation in the domestic market remains limited, with only 30 million euros directed to Greek products out of a total turnover of 682 million euros of the platform, a fact that confirms the international orientation of the average Greek investor of Freedom24, who is on average 35 years old, active in investments, with a systematic monthly presence, steadily building his portfolios with a long-term perspective and not occasionally. As emphasized by George Karageorgos, Head of Representative Office in Greece, “our goal is to strengthen the investment culture in Greece. We warmly thank the 100,000 Greek investors for their trust. This is a milestone that confirms the dynamic development of the company in our country and the trust of Greek investors in modern, transparent and easy-to-use digital investment solutions. We are committed to continuing to innovate, offer reliable solutions and support investment progress in Greece.” The Freedom24 office in Greece began operations in 2021 and has grown from 3 to 16 people in the last two years. In 2024, the company recorded a 71.6% increase in its client base compared to the previous financial year, and its client funds reached 330 million euros. It is the first international investment platform with ATHEX membership, with healthy client growth and fully coordinated with the preferences of Greek investors. The Greek office’s plans include connecting as a representative with the parent company in Cyprus, with the aim of expanding its investment portfolio. At the same time, it plans to offer fund transfer and card linking services to portfolios. Freedom24 is the European subsidiary of Freedom Holding Corp., a NASDAQ-listed international investment group with operations in the US, Europe and Central Asia. The group serves 555,000 clients worldwide and has a market capitalization of 9 billion dollars. As a European-based retail broker, Freedom24 offers access to over 40,000 stocks, 1,500 ETFs and 800,000 options on US stocks on the largest exchanges in the US, Europe and Asia. The platform has been awarded with awards such as “Best Multi-product Broker” in Italy and “Best ETF Broker” in Portugal, while it has also received the gold medal “Champion of Service” in Germany for two consecutive years. Freedom24 continues to expand its network across Europe, with a physical presence in 10 countries, including Greece.

Investors' renewed risk appetite on Tuesday boosted Nvidia shares—and those of several companies linked with the tech giant—a day before the company is slated to report earnings. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 3.2% amid a broad rally following President Donald Trump's weekend decision to postpone until early July a 50% tariff on European imports he first threatened on Friday. Consumer discretionary and tech stocks led Tuesday's rally, with small-cap and AI stocks performing particularly well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) Shares of Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) jumped nearly 50% on Tuesday. The power semiconductor maker’s stock soared more than 150% on Thursday after the company announced it would supply power chips for Nvidia’s next-generation AI systems. Navitas entered Tuesday's session with a market cap of about $850 million. Shares of several other Nvidia affiliates—past and present—were sharply higher Tuesday. Coreweave (CRWV), in which Nvidia held a nearly $1 billion stake as of the end of March, soared more than 20% on Tuesday. The cloud computing firm's stock has more than tripled in value since debuting on the Nasdaq in late March. SoundHound AI (SOUN) gained 16%, putting the stock up nearly 400% since Nvidia disclosed an equity stake in February 2024. Nvidia divested from SoundHound in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a regulatory filing earlier this year.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo and rising stock graph are seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK :Traders in the options markets are bracing for industry-wide volatility when AI-chipmaker Nvidia reports results on Wednesday, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy trading. For VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the largest semiconductors ETF with some $22 billion in assets, about 2.4 put options changed hands daily over the last 10 days against every call option traded, the most defensive the trading has been in about 10 months, according to Trade Alert data. Call options convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future while put contracts offer the right to sell the shares at a given price. "The put buying in SMH ahead of Nvidia's earnings reflects growing concern about potential volatility for the entire sector following the report," said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.

Title: Why Nvidia Is a Morgan Stanley 'Top Pick' Ahead of Earnings

Time Published: 2025-05-27T17:56:22Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley named Nvidia (NVDA) its "top pick" among semiconductor stocks Tuesday, a day before the chipmaker's expected earnings release, despite near-term concern over sales to China. The bank's analysts on Tuesday said potential issues that might trouble investors—like the impact of the Trump administration's ban on the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China—are "well telegraphed" and the "path to a [second-half] re-acceleration is clear." Nvidia has said it expects to face a $5.5 billion charge related to the tightened export controls. The bank affirmed its "overweight" rating and $160 price target, which implies a roughly 22% upside over the stock's closing level last Friday. The analysts said they are "not buying the stock for the [quarter] explicitly, but buying it for what we believe is coming." The impact of tighter export restrictions on China is softened by demand growth in the Middle East, Wedbush Securities analysts said Tuesday. Earlier this month, Nvidia announced a deal to supply chips to a Saudi Arabian startup and reportedly is involved in a deal allowing UAE to import advanced American-made chips. AI spending from Saudi Arabia and UAE "could help fill the void left by this near-term China uncertainty in Nvidia's future business" and potentially add $1 trillion to the global AI market in the coming years, the Wedbush analysts said. Wedbush's price target for Nvidia is $175, which—unlike Morgan Stanley's—is above the Visible Alpha analyst consensus approaching $164. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 3% to $135.53 in recent trading Tuesday to move into slightly positive territory for the year.

Title: 'Full hit from China': Analysts are staying bullish on Nvidia ahead of earnings, but tariffs loom large

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: Piper Sandler Warns Of The “Last Wave Of Negative News” Ahead Of NVIDIA’s Pivotal Q1’25 Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares have been firmly pegged on a dizzying roller-coaster ever since DeepSeek released its R1 model back in January, having contended with peak AI fears, a full-fledged global war and the ensuing rapid de-escalation, and the fallout from the ongoing decoupling between the US and China. Yet, NVIDIA seems to have emerged from these Sisyphean obstructions relatively unscathed, and is on the cusp of clearing its last remaining negative catalysts for the year, as per a new investment note from Piper Sandler. To wit, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has reiterated an 'Overweight' rating and $150 share price target for NVIDIA, while noting: "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week. We think that April quarter is poised for a miss in revenues largely from macro uncertainty and from the H20 ban." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the Trump administration recently imposed licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPUs, which is expected to translate to a $5.5 billion inventory-related charge in Q1. As per an estimation by Susquehanna analysts, these licensing requirements cost NVIDIA $1 billion in China-related sales over the last three weeks of the company's April-ending quarter. For the rest of the year, these lost sales are likely to amount to $3.5 billion per quarter. What's more, the H20-related write-downs might depress NVIDIA's margins by 11 percentage points to 67.7 percent in Q1, as per an analysis by Wedbush. Last week, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang declared that his company had walked away from $15 billion in potential annual sales in China following the imposition of licensing requirements. Concurrently, Huang predicted that the market for AI GPUs in China would swell to $50 billion in 2026. Of course, NVIDIA has been working on a China-specific, watered-down version of its Blackwell GPUs to comply with existing US export controls. However, given Washington's mercurial temperament towards all things China-related, the world's second-largest economy remains a persistent point of concern for NVIDIA. Coming back, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar believes NVIDIA's new China-specific Blackwell GPU will only launch in the latter half of its July-ending quarter. Kumar also believes that the factors responsible for NVIDIA's underperformance in Q1 are largely "outside" its control. The analyst goes on to note: "Despite this, we see a strong back half of the year given HPC capex coming on strong coupled with macro forces improving driven by sovereign investments following the announcements of several large deals over recent weeks." Kumar ends his note with solid advice: "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." Of course, while Piper Sandler appears cautious heading into NVIDIA's Q1 earnings print on Wednesday, Lynx Equity is anything but, boldly declaring that the stock could break out to new highs. "After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations." Lynx Equity also took pains to note the resurgence of CoWoS capacity build at TSMC, which strongly suggests recovery in NVIDIA's supply chain. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Trump's relationship with Apple in souring

Time Published: 2025-05-27T15:42:00Z

The president floated a 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the U.S. on Friday, adding that Apple (AAPL) would foot the bill. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,” President Trump said in a TruthSocial post on Friday morning. Shares in Apple were down almost 4% by market open. The threat followed a report by the Financial Times that Foxconn (HNHPF), Apple’s supplier, would spend $1.5 billion on a plant in India for iPhones. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during business roundtable in Qatar last week. I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Cook was absent from the president’s Middle East tour, which was attended by Big Tech’s leaders. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Trump said to Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The spat over Apple’s plans for Indian manufacturing marks a shift in Trump and Cook’s relationship, as the pair have historically been close allies. The president mistakenly called the CEO “Tim Apple” in 2019. That same year, the president told reporters that Cook is a “great executive because he calls me and others don’t.” Cook even donated $1 million of his personal money to Trump’s inauguration. On top of that, Apple committed to spend more than half a trillion dollars in the U.S over the next four years, with a focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, winning an exemption from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs. That exemption has since been made temporary, however. The possible 25% tariff comes at a bad time for Apple. It’s is the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, dropping 22%.

Title: The luxury housing market is cracking — and tech-heavy cities are getting hit hardest

Luxury home sales fell 10% in April from a year earlier, according to new data from Redfin (RDFN). While prices remain near record highs — with the median sale hitting $1.35 million, up nearly 7% since 2024 — beneath the surface, demand is cracking. The 10% drop in sales makes for the steepest decline since 2023 and the lowest April level in over a decade. Rising prices and rates on jumbo mortgages stubbornly stuck near five-year highs help to explain the sales decline. But this isn’t just a housing story. It’s a broader signal. For years, wealthy Americans bought the dip and shrugged off volatility. Now, they’re blinking. Evidence from the housing market and beyond suggests that the top 5% of U.S. households are growing skittish. Consider the location of the steepest declines — San Francisco, an extraordinarily tech-heavy market, but with its own finance-sector presence, too. Since 2022, nearly 500,000 tech workers have been laid off as major tech companies and smaller players have quietly offshored high-paying roles, from engineers to product managers. Even Walmart (WMT) is trimming corporate headcount — not out of desperation, but arguably because it can. The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) recently captured the new mood in boardrooms: “Everybody’s replaceable.” Such attitudes are likely to particularly affect white-collar workers in the wealthiest 5% who rely on their corporate salaries for the bulk of their income. In short, if such workers are anxious, they’re right to be. So they’re not buying mansions or rushing to close — they’re wondering if the floor beneath them is as solid as it felt a year or two ago. It’s a quiet kind of panic: the pullback of those who still have money, but no longer feel safe. The result is weakening demand in what should be the most interest-rate-immune and resilient segment of the market. There’s other evidence to suggest that the wealthy are parking capital, not deploying it. Numerous news reports, ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) earnings expected Wednesday, are pointing out that some $7 trillion is sitting in money-market funds. While not all this cash reflects U.S. upper-middle-class wealth, a portion of it certainly does, suggesting affluent Americans may currently see more risk than reward in assets such as stocks and housing. At the other end of the market, would-be buyers are priced out by 7% mortgage rates and $400,000 median homes, an affordability crisis devouring some 43% of median household income. When the housing market locks up at both ends, cost alone can’t explain the crisis. You have to look to confidence, and how that has gone missing.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Reuters (TRI), citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company is preparing to release a stripped-down version of its popular Blackwell AI chips that have been specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules. The news comes days before Nvidia prepares to release its first-quarter 2025 earnings. The Blackwell-based, China-only chip will reportedly cost from $6,000 to $8,000 and use conventional GDDR7 memory, a step down from the high-bandwidth tech in Nvidia’s flagship models. The previous H20 chips offered in the country sold for between $10,000 and $12,000. This coming chip also would ditch packaging in technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the company is looking at its “limited” options: “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.” This isn’t Nvidia’s first regulatory rodeo. After the U.S. blocked chip exports to China in 2022, the company responded with watered-down versions. When those got swept up in restrictions in late 2023, Nvidia developed chips with further reduced performance to comply with regulations. And that regulatory merry-go-round has continued. In April, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China. Now, Nvidia is hoping that this China-specific chip variant will thread the needle. CEO Jensen Huang has been increasingly vocal about his frustrations with U.S. policy. At an event earlier this month, he called the export controls “a failure,” saying they’ve only accelerated China’s push to develop domestic AI hardware — sidelining U.S. players in the process. Tech has become the next battleground in the trade war between the U.S. and China. As a result of Nvidia’s export restrictions, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is gaining ground with its AI chips, which are quickly becoming the preferred alternative for Chinese tech firms. Nvidia’s market share in China has reportedly fallen from 90% to around 50% since 2022. But China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. And this new chip is expected to help the company keep pace overseas despite its market share loss — because as good as Huawei is becoming, Nvidia is still considered better.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock A Buy Ahead Of Earnings?

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand as Nvidia remains at the forefront of ... More next-gen computing. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stands at a pivotal moment as it prepares to release its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on May 28, 2025. The semiconductor giant has transformed from a gaming graphics company into the backbone of AI infrastructure worldwide. However, recent stock performance and mounting geopolitical challenges have investors questioning whether Nvidia remains a compelling investment opportunity. This analysis examines Nvidia's year-to-date performance, key earnings metrics, macroeconomic headwinds and expert sentiment. With Wall Street projecting record revenue of $43.3 billion alongside a significant $5.5 billion writeoff related to China restrictions, the earnings report promises to be closely watched. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering their position before results are unveiled. Nvidia's 2025 journey has been marked by volatility, with shares trading approximately 5% lower year-to-date as of late May. The year began with turbulence when Chinese startup DeepSeek released a cost-effective AI model that challenged Big Tech's AI infrastructure spending assumptions. This development and signals from Microsoft regarding potential slowdowns in AI data center investments created uncertainty about Nvidia's growth sustainability. Geopolitical tensions have further complicated the stock performance under the Trump administration. Trade restrictions resulted in export bans on Nvidia's specialized chips to China, with CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging these policies cost the company approximately $15 billion in sales. The subsequent $5.5 billion write-off of H20 inventory designed for the Chinese market represents a tangible impact on Nvidia's financials. Despite challenges, Nvidia maintains exceptional financial strength, with $38.5 billion in cash versus $8.5 billion in debt. Recent developments, including expansion into Saudi Arabia and the UAE and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeal of certain chip trade restrictions, have provided positive momentum. Options traders are pricing in potential movements of up to 7.4% following earnings, reflecting continued volatility expectations. Nvidia's earnings will be scrutinized across multiple dimensions, with investors seeking insights into near-term performance and long-term positioning. The company has historically beaten quarterly guidance while providing forward estimates exceeding consensus. However, these "beat-and-raise" scenarios have become less dramatic as Wall Street caught up with Nvidia's trajectory. The earnings call will be crucial for understanding how to navigate geopolitical challenges while capitalizing on AI demand. Supply constraints remain the primary U.S. growth limitation, while international expansion strategies are critical for offsetting substantial China revenue loss. CEO Jensen Huang's commentary on competitive positioning and customer diversification will provide vital future insights. Wall Street projects record quarterly revenue of $43.3 billion for Q1 fiscal 2026, representing 66% growth versus $26 billion last year. While impressive, this means decelerating from the prior year's 262% revenue growth. Earnings per share are expected at $0.73, up from $0.61 year-over-year, with some analysts projecting adjusted EPS of $0.88, a 44% increase. These projections must consider the $5.5 billion H20 inventory write-off impacting reported results despite underlying business strength. Historical data shows that Nvidia shareholders who purchased before earnings and held for 12 months achieved median returns of 120% over the past decade. However, as always, given evolving competitive and regulatory landscapes, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Data center revenue represents Nvidia's crown jewel, growing from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $115 billion in fiscal 2025. This segment exited recent quarters with $35.6 billion revenue and $142 billion annualized run rate. Morningstar models $40 billion for April 2025, but reduced July estimates from $44 billion to $37.6 billion due to China restrictions. Supply constraints continue limiting Nvidia's demand fulfillment ability. Analysts expect incremental quarterly growth of approximately $4 billion through fiscal 2026, driven by additional supply and continued AI adoption. Growth sustainability depends on broader AI infrastructure investment trends and customer base diversification beyond hyperscale cloud providers. AI demand remains Nvidia's fundamental growth driver, dominating GPU provision for AI training and inference workloads. The CUDA software platform creates significant switching costs, establishing competitive advantages beyond hardware. However, recent developments, including DeepSeek's model and scaling law debates, have introduced questions about AI investment sustainability. Nvidia's unique position provides superior AI trend visibility across industries. The earnings call will reveal whether AI investment slowdown concerns are materializing or demand remains robust across customer segments and regions. Expansion beyond cloud providers into government and sovereign initiatives, particularly in the Middle East, could provide significant diversification benefits. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell architecture represents a critical future growth strategy, offering significant performance improvements over Hopper chips. Launch timing and execution face competitive pressure from semiconductor rivals and custom cloud provider chips. Early adoption, production schedules, and pricing will indicate Nvidia's ability to maintain technological leadership and premium positioning. Blackwell's strategic importance extends beyond immediate revenue, demonstrating continued innovation and commitment to evolving AI workload requirements. Supply chain execution is critical, given that historical demand exceeds supply for new generations. Success could offset China revenue headwinds while reinforcing Nvidia's preferred AI infrastructure provider position. The AI chip competitive landscape evolves rapidly, with major cloud providers investing in custom silicon while traditional semiconductor companies expand AI portfolios. Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Google's TPUs, and Microsoft/Meta design plans represent direct threats. AMD aggressively expands GPU lineups for cloud customers, while Intel develops AI accelerator products. Nvidia's competitive strategy extends beyond hardware to software, networking and services, creating comprehensive ecosystems that are difficult to replicate. However, major customers' desire to diversify suppliers and reduce single-vendor dependence represents structural challenges. Maintaining the pace of innovation while preserving switching costs through software advantages will determine sustained market position and premium valuations. U.S.-China geopolitical tensions represent the most significant macroeconomic headwind, with trade restrictions fundamentally altering Nvidia's addressable market. The Trump administration's export controls effectively blocked access to one of the world's largest AI markets. The $15 billion in lost sales represents just the beginning, as China's domestic semiconductor industry develops competitive alternatives like Huawei. Broader trade tension implications extend beyond direct restrictions to supply chain vulnerabilities and technology transfer concerns. Given Taiwan tensions, Nvidia's TSMC reliance on advanced production creates additional geopolitical risk. Middle East expansion attempts to diversify geographically, but newer markets may not offset the Chinese business scale. Reciprocal tariff threats could impact broader technology sector sentiment. Global economic conditions influence Nvidia through enterprise IT spending and AI startup venture capital impacts. Higher interest rates can reduce speculative AI investment appetite while slowing industry adoption. However, Nvidia shows remarkable economic cycle resilience, with AI infrastructure investment appearing relatively insensitive to traditional indicators. Well-capitalized customer bases provide some economic downturn insulation. Morningstar assigns Nvidia a 3-star "fairly valued" rating based on a $125 fair value estimate, suggesting the current $132-135 trading represents a slight overvaluation. The analysis acknowledges the potential for a higher fundamental value if geopolitical concerns diminish or AI demand proves more durable. The wide economic moat rating reflects confidence in competitive advantages, while the "Very High" uncertainty rating acknowledges AI market nascency and geopolitical complications. Wall Street sentiment remains generally positive despite challenges, with $43.3 billion consensus revenue projections showing continued growth confidence. However, decelerating growth rates and a focus on execution challenges suggest the "easy money" AI expansion phase may be ending. Analysts increasingly focus on navigating supply constraints, competitive pressures and geopolitical headwinds while maintaining premium pricing. Market indicators suggest continued volatility, with options pricing implying significant post-earnings movement potential. Historically strong 12-month pre-earnings buyer returns provide long-term investor comfort, but changing competitive and regulatory environments may limit historical trend applicability. Given concentrated Nvidia holdings among major index funds, institutional investor behavior will be closely watched. Bottom Line Nvidia looks like a clear buy heading into earnings, with strong fundamentals, dominant AI leadership and the potential to outperform if growth holds steady. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand, and despite its $5.5 billion China write-off, the company remains at the forefront of next-gen computing. Still, risks remain. Geopolitical pressures, export restrictions and growing competition could affect future performance. While the stock appears reasonably valued, any upside will depend on Nvidia’s ability to maintain its technological edge and weather a more complex global environment.

Title: This 1 Simple Trick Can Make CEF Management Fees Vanish

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Wooden Blocks with the text: Fees Plenty of investors miss out on the huge yields (often north of 8%) that closed-end funds (CEFs) offer. There’s one simple reason why: They get way too hung up on management fees. We’re going to look at a few reasons why that is today—and one easy way you can make those fees disappear entirely. But first, just how high are the fees we’re talking about? Well, the average fee for all CEFs tracked by my CEF Insider service is 2.95% of assets. In contrast, the largest ETF on the planet, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has a fee of just 0.09%. So, to be sure, we are talking about a big gap here. But although CEFs’ fees are much higher, there are many reasons why we shouldn’t put too much weight on them when making buying decisions. Let’s talk about those now. SPY holds every stock in the S&P 500—in other words, the 500 large-cap companies that represent the biggest public firms in America. And while these stocks do well in good times, they can have rough runs, like we saw in April, for example. That’s why we want to make sure we’re investing in assets beyond stocks, like corporate bonds. CEFs let us do that, and they give us access to smart human managers (not to mention high dividends), too. An actual person at the helm is vital in a lot of these asset classes, and in particular corporate bonds, because deep connections are key to getting access to the best new issues. We all know deep down that diversification works. But using CEFs to do it really can take things to another level, thanks in part to their high dividends. Look at the performance of the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), in purple below, since the start of 2025 to the time of this writing. GHY is a CEF Insider holding that yields an outsized 9.8%. GHY Total Returns As you can see, GHY outran SPY (in orange) while diversifying its shareholders beyond stocks and the US, too. In addition, the bond CEF barely fell below breakeven in April, while stocks were down 15%. And bear in mind, as well, that these numbers are net of fees. Speaking of which, GHY’s fees are far higher than those of SPY (1.5% of assets compared to 0.09%) All that said, some CEFs do focus on S&P 500 companies, and still have higher fees, which brings me to my second point… GHY, as mentioned, has total expenses of 1.5%, better than the CEF average but still quite high. Compare that to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), an S&P 500–focused CEF whose fees are much less, at 0.97%. But wait, if SPXX is focused on US large caps, why are its fees around 10 times those of SPY? It’s largely because SPXX also sells call options on its holdings—or rights for investors to buy them at a fixed date and price in the future. The fund gets paid for these rights (and uses those fees to help fund its 7.7% dividend). There’s some cost and work attached to that strategy, hence the higher fees. But it’s a small price to pay to get a dividend that’s nearly six times that of SPY. Currently, all CEFs covered by CEF Insider have an average yield of 9.1%, while SPY, as mentioned, yields 1.3%. In other words, a million dollars spread across all CEFs would get you over $90,000 in annual income, or $7,572 a month, versus less than $13,000, or about $1,075 monthly, from SPY. Income Potential This is why many investors use CEFs to fund an early, or partial, retirement; if it takes $682,286 in savings to replace the average paycheck in America (as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ median weekly earnings survey) with CEFs but a staggering $4.8 million saved with SPY, you can see why CEFs could attract more attention—and thus, CEF issuers can charge higher fees. Now, here’s the kicker: CEFs have an unusual structure that means they often trade for less than their assets are actually worth. Let’s say you have a CEF that has $100,000 spread across shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), among others, and the CEF has 10,000 shares in total. Each share is worth $10. Easy enough. But CEFs are, as the name says, closed. That means CEF issuers can’t issue new shares to new investors, so all of the shares trade on the public market, like stocks, and their market prices fluctuate based on investor demand, sometimes diverging from the actual value of the underlying holdings. If that demand is higher than the actual market value of the CEF, it’ll trade at a premium to its portfolio’s net asset value, or NAV; if lower, it’ll trade at a discount. On average, CEFs trade at a 6% discount, according to CEF Insider data. So if your CEF trades at a discount wider than its annual management fee, the discount can effectively offset the cost of that fee. And bear in mind that some CEFs are steeply discounted, with discounts of 10% or more. It’s worth pointing out that the fees are taken out of the CEF’s portfolio by managers automatically as a matter of course; investors don’t have to mail off a check. Let’s wrap with a quick recap, then: CEFs give you access to discounted, high-quality assets, far higher income than most ETFs, and they give you a high-income, low-cost way to diversify, too. Plus, the best CEFs outperform their benchmarks—including the S&P 500. This is why CEFs are a passive income weapon that many wealthy investors are happy to keep in their arsenal.

Title: Markets soar after Trump walks back EU trade threats

U.S. stocks rose sharply Tuesday, with the S&P 500 climbing over 2%, the Nasdaq gaining 2.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 740 points, or 1.8%, in a rebound from last week’s selloff. Bond yields declined around the globe, including in the U.S., where the 10-year Treasury dipped below 4.5%. Gold tumbled 2%. The catalyst: President Donald Trump announced a delay in his threatened 50% tariff hike on European imports, opting instead for expedited trade talks with the E.U. The move followed a weekend call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and marks a sharp turn from Friday’s rhetoric, which had markets on edge — especially after Trump warned Apple that foreign-assembled iPhones could soon face steep levies. Consider the actual events: Trump escalated a conflict by threatening 50% tariffs on the E.U., including on Apple’s (AAPL) foreign-assembled iPhones, essentially manufacturing a crisis. Then, after a phone call, he announced a delay on those tariffs, positioning the pause as a negotiated victory or goodwill gesture. But since he created the crisis in the first place, the “deal” or “pause” is just Trump backing off his own threat. Another weird twist in the story? In the same social media post that kicked off the weekend’s trade crisis, Trump threatened a specific 25% tariff on iPhones not assembled in the U.S. This prompted critics — including hedge fund manager Spencer Hakimian in a widely shared tweet — to point out that such policy would mean firms like Samsung, which fully produce their products abroad, would in fact face lower levies and effectively be granted a price advantage vs. actual American companies like Apple. After the tweet went viral, Trump pivoted, issuing a similar tariff warning to Samsung. Markets have been whipsawed again and again in 2025 as the White House pivoted, then pivoted again, repositioning global trade policy in posts and offhand comments. The current reprieve hinges on progress in fast-tracked talks between now and July 9, the new deadline Trump has set for potential tariff implementation. For now, though, stocks are flying — helped along by rallying bonds and the hope that this latest tariff scare will end not with a bang but a negotiation. The rest of the week promises more market-moving news. Semiconductor giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) reports after the bell tomorrow, with investors watching closely and the results likely to dominate headlines for several days. The results of the Fed’s early May meeting will also be released Wednesday. While no surprises are expected, every word is still likely to be parsed for any clues on inflation and potential rate cuts in the back half of 2025.

Title: Nvidia's $43 billion question: Can Jensen Huang keep the AI hype train on track?

Nvidia (NVDA) has become the almost undisputed poster child of the AI boom — and now it’s time to show the receipts. The $3.3 trillion chipmaker will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2026 on Wednesday, and expectations are enormous. Analysts forecast a revenue surge to $43.26 billion, nearly 66% higher than the same quarter a year ago, with adjusted earnings per share jumping to $0.88 from $0.61, a growth of about 44%. Still, those forecasts might be selling the semiconductor giant short. The company has a habit of surpassing earnings expectations — topping earnings estimates by an average of about 7% in the last two quarters. Nvidia, whose chips have become the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, has been on a staggering run. But with stakes this high, investors are laser-focused on whether Nvidia’s latest bets — such as its next-gen Blackwell platform, deepening cloud partnerships, and response to U.S.-China chip tensions — will deliver the kind of blockbuster quarter the markets have come to expect. At the heart of Nvidia’s revenue machine is its Data Center business, which has grown into its largest and most profitable segment thanks to insatiable demand from cloud providers, AI startups, and enterprise customers building foundation models. Analysts expect this division alone to generate $21.27 billion in Q1 revenue. CEO Jensen Huang has positioned Nvidia not just as a chipmaker but as the infrastructure layer powering the AI revolution. The company is hoping that narrative continues with Blackwell, the GPU architecture introduced in March that Huang says will unlock the training and deployment of models that are orders of magnitude more powerful than current systems. The flagship GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip is already being integrated by hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOGL), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL). Nvidia may be dominant, but it’s not operating in a vacuum. Rival chipmakers like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are racing to close the performance gap, while companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on custom silicon to reduce reliance on third-party GPUs. At the same time, a wave of Chinese AI chipmakers is emerging as Nvidia contends with export restrictions, creating fresh competitive pressure in one of its most important markets. But Nvidia isn’t just about GPUs anymore. As investor expectations climb, the company is quietly broadening its AI stack — moving beyond silicon into networking, software, and cloud integration in a bid to become the full-stack backbone of AI infrastructure. Nvidia is deepening its economic moat and creating more stable, recurring revenue streams that could smooth earnings volatility over time. Through partnerships with major cloud providers, Nvidia is embedding itself into the very platforms AI developers rely on. Basically: Nvidia is trying to become more than just a supplier of AI tools. The company wants to become a critical platform for AI development itself. Investors will be watching closely for clear evidence that Nvidia’s expansion beyond GPUs is starting to pay off in revenue. Wall Street wants to see whether the company’s networking products are contributing to meaningful growth within the data center segment. Margins will also be a key focus. Networking and software typically deliver higher profitability than hardware, so any signs of margin expansion would support the narrative that Nvidia is transforming into a more durable, high-margin platform business. (Which could reassure investors that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable and not just tied to cyclical chip demand.) Finally, Wall Street will listen for signs that Nvidia’s AI software stack is gaining adoption among large enterprises outside the hyperscaler ecosystem — into sectors such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing — which would highlight the long-term potential of Nvidia’s platform strategy and reinforce the company’s role as the backbone of AI development. There is, of course, a major x-factor: China. Nvidia is ground zero in the U.S.-China tech rivalry — its GPUs might just be the most valuable components in the AI arms race, and its position is increasingly shaped by policy, not just engineering. Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue, but that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs. Huang said recently that years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang has said. To defend — and expand — its foothold, Nvidia is looking to establish an R&D center in Shanghai and is reportedly preparing further downgraded chip models that comply with U.S. rules. Investors will be looking to see the impact of U.S. export controls: how much they’ve dented sales, whether downgraded chips can sustain demand in China, and more. Wall Street will also be watching for any supply chain stress; Nvidia relies heavily on TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing, and its capacity constraints remain a gating factor. While the company remains dominant in many global markets — and is expanding into the Middle East through Saudi Arabia, in what one analyst called a “watershed moment,” and the United Arab Emirates — Wall Street will be looking for updates on how Nvidia plans to navigate what could be its most challenging international landscape in years. Nvidia is the poster child of the AI trade, and its financial performance serves as a high-frequency indicator of how far the generative AI economy has progressed from hype to hard returns. A strong beat would signal that tech giants (see: Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are continuing to pour billions into AI infrastructure, reaffirming the AI investment thesis that has largely powered the Nasdaq’s rally. Nvidia’s valuation is rich, but so are many other AI-linked names. If Nvidia meets or beats expectations, it could justify the current risk appetite for high-growth names. But a miss, even a tiny one, could trigger a sentiment reset. If forward guidance is strong, it’ll show that enterprises are starting to spend on AI beyond experiments — e.g., in areas such as software integration, inference, and LLM deployment. Nvidia’s stock has been on quite a wild ride in 2025. After hitting a high earlier in the year, shares fell amid broader market turbulence and investor anxiety about whether the AI trade had gotten overheated. President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement sent the stock into a sharp dip, but it has since rebounded. Now, this quarter’s results could be a clearing event that could reestablish momentum. One looming concern: supply chain capacity. Demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to exceed supply, and while the company has worked to scale production, it may still be leaving money on the table simply due to how long it takes to manufacture and deliver its most advanced products. Investors will also be watching closely for details on capital expenditures and supply chain resilience. Wall Street will want to see how aggressively Nvidia is investing to expand capacity, whether through additional foundry partnerships or securing more critical components. Any signs that supply constraints are easing — or worsening — could influence how sustainable current growth trajectories appear. But the big question now is whether Nvidia can not only meet but beat expectations — something it has done consistently. While Nvidia remains possibly the most important company in the world’s hottest tech sector, that also means the pressure is greater than ever.

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."
