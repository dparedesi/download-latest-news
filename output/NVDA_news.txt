Title: Coreweave stock gains 9% on fresh $2 billion Nvidia investment

Shares of Coreweave (CRWV) rose 9% during pre-market trading on Monday after AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) invested another $2 billion in an effort to accelerate the company's buildout of next-generation data centers built specifically for AI workloads. The funding, which came through the purchase of CoreWeave’s Class A stock at $87.20 per share, will help the company scale up to more than 5 gigawatts of AI-dedicated data centers, or “AI factories,” by the end of the decade. CRWV closed at $92.98 on Friday. With the early gain, the stock is trading just above $101. NVDA shares are lower by 0.5% pre-market. Nvidia's backing provides more than capital. The deal also extends a years-long collaboration that aligns both firms on hardware, software and data center strategy. The companies will also test CoreWeave’s software stack, including its resource scheduling platform Mission Control, with an eye toward integrating it into Nvidia's broader ecosystem. “CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia said in a statement. Nvidia last September entered into a $6.3 billion agreement with CoreWeave to purchase unsold computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave started as a bitcoin mining company in 2017 under the name Atlantic Crypto, but quickly pivoted to cloud computing and AI after the crypto crash in 2018. More For You Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale. What to know: Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token. The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.
