Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief. The White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States’ most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month. But smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump’s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it’s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday. That’s not to say tariffs won’t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company $1.1 billion this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in. Under different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America come from India. And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple’s largest market. “In terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. “I think what’s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they’re going to capitalize on AI.” Tariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage. A combination of Apple’s diversified supply chain – which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID – along with its high margins and Cook’s operations expertise put the company in a strong position. Supply chain resilience is “supposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,” said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys. That held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday. While moves like these don’t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.” Some analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday’s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future. “Because (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,” said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation’s data and analytics team. “But it is important, of course. It does present a risk.” That said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple’s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don’t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can’t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don’t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance. “It’s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,” said Bjørhovde. “Because you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.” Cook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for “a while” during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company’s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside. “Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we’re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we’re doing the glass here, we’re doing the Face ID module here, and so there’s a ton of it, and we’re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,” Cook said. “And so there’s a lot of content in there from United States.” The narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year – and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers. And the company’s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple’s. Just this week, Google posted an ad for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: “If you buy a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.” Apple’s initial batch of AI features also didn’t launch in time for the iPhone 16’s arrival last September. At the same time, many of Apple’s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple (AAPL) might reach first. That’s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta (META) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models. Still, Apple saw stellar earnings results for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales – including in China – and overall revenue. But during Apple’s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company’s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap. “Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,” Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. “We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” But Apple can’t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone’s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm – the three of which dominate the Android phone space – to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “What’s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?” he said. “I mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that’s the real focus on Apple right now.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Meets President Trump Amidst Talks Of ‘Kill Switches’ For China AI GPUs

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump earlier today, reports CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, after the firm hit back against kill switches in its GPUs in an earlier blog post. NVIDIA, the most valuable company in the world, is at the center of the global technology industry's attention due to its AI GPUs and their sales restrictions. Its recent blog post came after an earlier announcement shared that the firm expected the Trump administration to grant China AI GPU export licenses, and while the content of Huang's meeting with Trump is unclear, it could revolve around the license approvals and kill switches inside the GPUs. While the Trump administration has decided to process China AI GPU licenses, it is unclear while NVIDIA has started to receive them. The firm's smaller rival, AMD, has yet to receive licenses for the chips that were restricted for sale to China earlier this year; a fact that its CEO, Lisa Su, confirmed in an interview earlier today. As a result, NVIDIA could be waiting for the license approval, with a key bargaining point being backdoors, as it tries to secure approval for the Chinese products. Huang's visit to the White House comes as Apple CEO Tim Cook is also expected to be present there to announce a $600 billion investment package in the US. The package is expected to add $100 billion to Apple's earlier investment, with the firm's shares rising by 6% today on the news. Apple has run into trouble with the Trump administration as its efforts to shift production to India from China have come right when the US government is increasing the pressure on the country to stop buying Russian oil. As a result, the shares gained today as investors expected a thaw in its relations with the government. Since CNBC spotted Huang at the White House with a camera placed to note Cook's arrival, it's unclear why the CEO is meeting with the president. However, given the current environment surrounding its China GPUs, potential backdoors and license approvals, it's likely that these could be the talking points on the agenda. NVIDIA has already announced a $500 billion AI data center infrastructure investment in the US, which makes it unlikely that the firm could announce more investments later during the afternoon. #Breaking.

Title: How To Tap The AI Nuclear Bonanza For 10%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. The AI boom still has plenty of room to run—but investing purely in AI stocks is not the best way to tap into it. NVIDIA (NVDA) and friends yield next to nothing! And these are crowded trades. Luckily for us, there’s another way to get in. Bargains are still available in the corner of the market we’ll get into below—as are 10%+ dividends. It’s all tied into AI’s voracious appetite for electricity. Yes, utilities are part of this play, but we want to go a little bit deeper and zero in on stocks specifically tied into nuclear power. We’re going to tap into those through high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that both trade at discounts and send huge payouts our way, too. Let me explain. It’s been about a month since the Wall Street Journal reported on President Trump’s plans to expand nuclear power in the US. The story went mostly unnoticed, but it’s an important one because it’s a multi-year plan that has bipartisan—and indeed non-political—support. For a couple of years now, tech companies have been pushing for more nuclear power. Alphabet (GOOGL) has been investing billions into nuclear-power companies such as Kairos Power and Elementl Power, while Amazon poured $500 million into X-Energy to build up nuclear capacity. AI, and its near-bottomless power demand, are behind these moves. And since AI is now transforming the American workplace and boosting productivity, the debate over whether this tech is a flash in the pan or here to stay is settled: It’s here to stay. Back in September 2020 (i.e., long before ChatGPT was released), I wrote in my CEF Insider advisory that one needs to invest widely to benefit from the technology, since it can produce efficiencies in circuitous ways: “Some companies, like insurance firms, will profit from artificial intelligence as this technology improves underwriting, lowers risk and improves health outcomes for patients.” The growing attention that nuclear power is getting is a prime example of this circuitous, second- and third-order benefit from AI playing out. Since AI is power-hungry, electricity and infrastructure suppliers serving the growing nuclear-power business will benefit. You might be thinking, “Okay, but how do I actually ride this wave?” Well, as I mentioned off the top, we need to look further afield than the NVIDIAs of the world to capture these higher-order effects of AI. That’s where utilities come in: Higher energy demand is a clear win for utilities, yet in the three years since ChatGPT and its range of copycats have been released, the utilities sector, shown in orange above by the performance of the benchmark Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU), has returned just 25%, less than half the broader market. That tells us the sector as a whole is still undervalued. And it also means buying XLU is still on the table as a way to capture the growing power (and specifically nuclear-power) demand AI is creating. But XLU isn’t the only play, and it’s hardly the best. As an index fund, it gets us broad exposure to the utilities sector, but broad isn’t what we want with something like AI, which is being brought in unevenly throughout the country. We want something a bit more tactical to target where the demand is hottest. A more active approach, like that of a CEF called the Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT), fits the bill here. The fund holds firms like WEC Energy (WEC), which is looking at expanding nuclear power production in Wisconsin, and Constellation Energy (CEG), owner of the largest collection of nuclear plants in the US. Plus, with its 10.7% yield, GUT is a much better income provider than 2.8%-yielding XLU. Plus, over the long haul, GUT (in orange above) has closely tracked XLU’s total returns, so we’re not sacrificing performance for income here. However, there are two snags with this fund. First, if GUT is just tracking the index, it isn’t outperforming and thus we can’t expect it to be tactical enough to benefit from the AI boom more than an index fund would. Plus, the fund is far from a bargain. GUT currently trades at a 96.2% premium to NAV. That’s the second-highest premium in the CEF world, and it means investors are paying nearly $2 for every $1 of assets! And, as we saw last year, that premium can disappear fast, causing big losses in the short term, as well. So, while GUT has done a good job transforming utilities’ profits into income, its premium and its historical performance suggest it isn’t the way to go for us. So instead, let’s look at another CEF, the 10.1%-yielding Voya Infrastructure Industrials and Materials Fund (IDE), which trades at a 4% discount to NAV. As the name says, the fund holds key infrastructure suppliers like Siemens AG, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Schneider Electric SE, all of which stand to gain from an AI-driven infrastructure buildout, including on the nuclear front. Not only is IDE a lot cheaper than GUT, it’s also outperformed it on a total-NAV-return basis (based on its underlying portfolio, not its sentiment-driven market price) over the last three years. With a slightly higher total NAV return, IDE’s management has proven they know where to put money to get returns, and the fund’s lower volatility is attractive, too. Without big swings in its asset value, like GUT saw in 2023, IDE hasn’t had to sell assets at a loss to maintain its payouts. Additionally, the fact that IDE has beaten GUT over the last three years on a total-NAV-return basis, suggests it is being more tactical and benefiting more from the AI boom. That makes it more than worth your attention as a place to invest as nuclear demand rises in the long term. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

U.S. equities fell at midday following a weak report on the services industry and concerns about new tariffs. The S&P 500, and Nasdaq dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. Gartner (IT) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the research and advisory firm slashed its guidance on declining revenue at its largest research unit. Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) slumped after the drugmaker announced a Phase 2 trial of its experimental pain medicine missed a key goal, and that it would no longer continue its development. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers slid when President Donald Trump said in an interview he would be announcing new semiconductor tariffs soon. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares took off when the Taser maker exceeded earnings and revenue estimates and boosted its outlook on strong demand for its security products. DuPont (DD) also raised its guidance as it lowered its estimate for how much tariffs would impact full-year earnings. In addition, the chemical and materials maker reported better-than-expected results, and shares gained. Software analytics firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR) beat profit and sales estimates and lifted its outlook as it benefited from artificial intelligence product demand and more government contracts. Oil futures slid. Gold prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the yen, but lost ground to the euro and pound. Major cryptocurrencies traded down. TradingView

U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after indexes rebounded yesterday following last week's selloff; Palantir (PLTR) shares are surging in premarket trading after the firm raised its sales outlook amid strong demand for its AI platform; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports second-quarter results after the closing bell today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reportedly has fired some employees after discovering a leak of sensitive trade secrets; and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares are plunging after it ended development of a pain treatment after test results did not meet its goals. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after indexes surged Monday to rebound from last week's selloff. Nasdaq futures are 0.4% higher after the tech-heavy index gained 2% in the prior session, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% after the benchmark index rose 1.5% yesterday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are little changed. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is near flat at nearly $115,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is higher. Oil and gold futures are both declining. Palantir (PLTR) shares are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm posted better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised its outlook on strong demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform. The AI software company reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents on revenue that jumped 48% year-over-year to a record $1 billion, above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Palantir's commercial business nearly doubled from a year ago, while its U.S. business grew 68%. Palantir sees third-quarter sales of $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion, and full-year revenue of $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, both ranges above analysts' estimates. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is set to report second-quarter results after the closing bell today after a strong run for the chipmaker's stock amid hopes export curb headwinds could soon ease. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect AMD to report adjusted EPS of $0.48 on revenue that jumped 27% revenue to $7.43 billion on strong data center sales. AMD warned in May that it would likely take a hit from tighter restrictions on chip exports to China, though the company said last month that it plans to restart exports of its MI308 chips once it receives final approval from U.S. authorities. AMD shares are higher by nearly 2% in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) has reportedly discovered a leak of trade secrets related to its advanced chipmaking process and has taken disciplinary actions against the employees involved. Multiple outlets reported that TSMC said its comprehensive monitoring process allowed it to discover the issue and carry out a swift internal investigation. Nikkei Asia reported that the company fired several employees for attempting to obtain proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a key supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). TSMC shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares are falling 14% in premarket trading after the drugmaker said it would end development of its VX-993 pain treatment after tests failed to meet goals. The news trumped better-than-expected second-quarter results, as Vertex's adjusted earnings per share of $4.52 and revenue that increased 12% to $2.96 billion topped Visible Alpha projections. Last quarter, Vertex said that research and development costs were weighing on results.

Stock market rally today has captured Wall Street’s attention as the Dow Jones jumped 500 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posting strong gains. This sharp rebound follows a weak U.S. payroll report, which has increased hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts as early as September. With only 73,000 jobs added in July and unemployment ticking up, investors now expect multiple interest rate cuts by the end of 2025. President Donald Trump’s strong reaction to the data, including the firing of the BLS chief, adds political drama as markets shift.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) In the world of rock climbing, athletes don't simply grab a new ledge and reach out for the next one. First, they put their full weight on the new ledge to ensure it's solid before aiming higher. Bitcoin BTC$116,681.51 has followed a similar pattern since Friday's U.S. jobs data, which triggered concerns of a recession in the world's largest economy. The cryptocurrency's price came under pressure, dropping almost to $111,965, testing support at the then-record high set in May, over the weekend. It recovered to trade recently around $114,700. The decline resulted in roughly $670 million in losses on perpetual futures positions, of which over $550 million were long positions, according to Coinglass. The crowding out of the excess leverage could mean a more sustainable upswing in prices. John Glover, the chief investment officer at Ledn, said he now expects BTC to rally to around $140,000 by year-end. 10x Research recently identified the $111,965 level as an attractive risk-reward entry point for traders. The price rebound suggests some may have followed that advice to join the bull run. Canary Capital CEO Stephen McClurg argued that bitcoin is rapidly positioning itself as a turbocharged risk asset, aligned with Nasdaq trends, but with greater volatility. He called stablecoins digital cousins of money market funds. On the macro front, the nonfarm payrolls data revealed a sharp slowdown in the labor market, reviving prospects of a Fed interest-rate cut in September. Still, with the expectations being spurred by economic pain, they may not necessarily bode well for risk assets. This week's U.S. CPI and PPI inflation readings will help solidify the outlook. Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at crypto exchange Bitget, said BTC is likely to consolidate around $112,000-$118,000 this week, supported by strong technicals and ether to trade in the $3,300-$3,800 range driven by ETF inflows and institutional interest. "Rising ETH adoption and on-chain activity could fuel outperformance, but bitcoin's dominance may cap significant altcoin gains unless broader market sentiment shifts further toward risk-on behavior," Lee told CoinDesk in an email. Speaking of ether, a whale conducted a large buy-the-dip operation over the weekend, snapping up millions in ETH in a sign of their long-term conviction. In other news, Base now leads Solana in daily token introductions, driven by the rise of Zora's Creator Coins, according to Dune Analytics. Lido, the liquid staking platform, laid off 15% of its workforce. "While it may seem counterintuitive amid a market upswing, the move reflects a deliberate commitment to sustainable growth, operational focus, and alignment with the priorities of LDO tokenholders," Lido DAO's Vasiliy Shapovalov said on X. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 rose over 0.5% while the dollar index added 0.2%. Morgan Stanley called Friday's dip in stocks a buy-the-dip opportunity. Stay alert!
