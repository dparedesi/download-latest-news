Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © pestoverde / Flickr Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is pushing higher on a report from Truth Social that the tech giant could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and other high-demand areas. All under the condition that a quarter of sales be paid to the U.S. government. As a result, analysts at Bernstein just initiated an outperform rating on NVDA, noting that if reports are accurate, NVDA can ship chips to some customers in China, which is a positive development. Just yesterday, analysts at Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia, citing a significant opportunity with data centers. After all, artificial intelligence will continue to create massive demand for data centers. Right now, according to MIT Technology Review, there are about 3,000 data centers across the U.S. Plus, according to a report from McKinsey, $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure investments will be needed by 2030. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are down about $2.62 at the moment. However, Deutsche Bank analysts see more upside heading into earnings. The firm reiterated its buy rating on MU ahead of the company’s earnings on December 17, with a price target of $280, up from $200. The firm believes MU is well-positioned to benefit from the memory cycle, with HBM driving structural changes in the semiconductor industry. And down, but not out, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are being viewed positively by analysts at Needham. The firm has a buy rating on NFLX and doesn’t believe it needs Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the firm, “NFLX buying WBD would put $83B of additional value at risk of being disrupted by GenAI. Without WBD, NFLX is more global, more nimble, more tech-first, and has more flexibility with the Hollywood unions (called Guilds),” as quoted by CNBC. Just the other day, Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on NFLX. The firm noted, “We acknowledge that NFLX shares have been largely reactive to recent developments re: potential strategic outcomes. But we believe Netflix’s long-term fundamental outlook is increasingly strengthening, thanks to its highly compelling value proposition, its excellent execution track record, and its improved global, competitive positioning,” as quoted by CNBC.

Stock futures are holding steady as investors await the Federal Reserve's final decision of the year on interest rates; the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting today, weighing signs that the labor market is weakening against lingering concerns about inflation; Nvidia will be allowed to sell its H200 chips to companies in China, with 25% of revenue going to the U.S. government; the European Union is investigating Google's use of online data to train its AI models; and Home Depot shares are falling as the company issued an outlook for 2026 that came in below analysts' expectations. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are hovering near unchanged this morning ahead of the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated decision on interest rates, which is due Wednesday afternoon. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the benchmark S&P 500 were up less than 0.1% recently, while those linked to the the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. The major indexes each declined Monday after ending last week near record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was unchanged from yesterday's close at 4.17%, near its highest level in more than two months. Bitcoin was trading at $90,600, up from an overnight low of $89,500. Gold futures were up 0.3% at $4,230 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 0.2% to around $59 per barrel. The Federal Reserve's policy committee is scheduled to convene its two-day meeting today, with a decision on interest rates coming at the end of the gathering. The Fed is widely expected to lower its benchmark fed funds rate for the third consecutive meeting. In addition to awaiting the decision, market participants are eager to see the quarterly projections from committee members on key economic indicators and rates, and to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed, which is trying to balance fears about a weakening labor market against concerns that inflation remains too high, will get an important piece of data on Tuesday with the release of the Job Openings & Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for October. Nvidia (NVDA) got some good news Monday afternoon, when President Donald Trump said that his administration will allow Nvidia to sell its older generation of artificial intelligence GPUs, the H200, to "approved customers" in China, with a 25% cut going to the U.S. government. The Trump and Biden administrations each had concerns about Nvidia and other chipmakers selling their most advanced products to companies in China, amid worries that there could be national security risks in letting China develop its own AI models with the technology. Earlier this year, Nvidia agreed to give the government 15% of sales of its lower-powered H20 chip in China, but the plans fell apart when the Chinese government told companies not to buy them because of its own security concerns with bringing in American products with government involvement. Nvidia shares were up about 1% in recent premarket trading. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is the subject of a new probe from the European Commission, as the enforcement arm of the European Union will investigate whether Google acted anticompetitively by using online content and YouTube videos to train its AI models. The Commission is "concerned" that Google is using content from online publishers to create the "AI Overviews" at the top of search results pages without proper compensation and offering unfair terms when it does compensate, and that it is giving its own AI models "privileged access" to online content, putting other companies looking to train AI models at a disadvantage. The investigation is the latest in the region's antitrust push against big tech companies. The EU last week announced a probe into whether Meta Platforms (META) is violating antitrust law with policies prohibiting other AI companies from interacting with users in WhatsApp, potentially giving an advantage to its own chatbot Meta AI. Home Depot (HD) shares are moving lower Tuesday morning after the home improvement retail giant provided a lackluster outlook for next year ahead of its annual investor day. Expecting the broader home improvement market to either decline by up to 1% or grow by up to 1% next year, Home Depot said it expects its own total sales to grow by 2.5% to 4.5%. That compares with the consensus analyst forecast of 4.3%, according to Visible Alpha. Home Depot's adjusted earnings per share and comparable sales growth forecasts also came in short of what analysts expected. The retailer said it expects sales and profits to grow once the housing market picks up and "pent-up demand" for home improvement projects can be realized, and said it expects to continue growing faster than the larger home improvement market and its competitors. Home Depot shares were down nearly 3% before the opening bell.

Nvidia stock today: Nvidia shares jumped about 2% after President Trump approved H200 AI chip sales to China with a 25% revenue share to the US. The move restores access to a market that once drove 20–25% of Nvidia’s data-center sales. Xi Jinping responded positively. NVDA is up nearly 40% this year, easing major policy uncertainty and boosting long-term optimism.

Time Published: 2025-12-08T19:18:50Z
Full Content:
Shares of CoreWeave (CRWV) lost ground Monday after the cloud computing company said it would sell $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The shares were down close to 5% in recent trading. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The data center provider backed by AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said the convertible senior notes coming due in 2031 will be made in a private offering, and initial investors would have the option to purchase an additional $300 million worth within a 13-day period from the issuance date. Convertible debt offerings can offer a relatively simple and inexpensive way for companies to raise capital. However, existing shareholders may view them negatively, as they can be dilutive and may raise concerns about a company's debt levels. CoreWeave said that a portion of the proceeds will be used for capped call transactions, with the rest for general corporate purposes. The move comes after a recent pullback in CoreWeave's shares amid worries about an AI bubble, after a big run-up in its stock following its public debut in March. Even with CoreWeave's recent losses, the stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price.

(NASDAQ: GOOG) Robotics News: Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That’s the foundation of Google DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that “think” before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics. The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. “Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task,” said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind.
