Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: The mystery of Nvidia’s underperforming stock

Nvidia may be the biggest name in the artificial-intelligence boom, but the stock has lagged behind peers over the past few months. “Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, it’s hard to find a stronger performer than Nvidia," Bespoke Investment Group wrote on Wednesday. The market research group noted that Nvidia shares were up 982% from that date through their record close on Aug. 12. However, Nvidia’s footing has looked increasingly shaky, especially relative to other AI-linked stocks. A basket of stocks including foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, data-storage company Seagate Technology, and memory-chip maker Micron has gained 68.2% since Oct. 31, 2024; Nvidia has gained just 28.3% since then. The underperformance is evident even when comparing Nvidia to other stocks, not just chip makers. Bespoke’s “Picks & Shovels" basket, which includes energy and data-center infrastructure stocks like Constellation Energy, Vistra, NRG Energy, and Quanta Services has gained nearly 61% since Oct. 31—more than twice as much as Nvidia. The latest leg of the performance gap was kicked off by earnings from Oracle earlier this month, Bespoke noted. It revealed a significant increase in Oracle’s backlog for contracted work. “We don’t have a strong thesis as to why NVDA has been such a relative underperformer over the past month," the research group admitted. Investor expectations were high, but Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report was far from a bust. Adjusted earnings, revenue, and third-quarter revenue guidance all came in above expectations. One might think the company’s troubles in China are spooking investors. Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed last month to give the Trump administration a 15% cut of their AI-chip sales in the country. Then, on Wednesday, a report suggested Chinese companies had been banned from purchasing Nvidia’s semiconductors. But the stock actually inched up following confirmation from the White House in August. And even though shares tumbled on Wednesday, closing down 2.6%, they bounced back on Thursday. Even if Chinese sales are challenged, “other buyers appear to be as desperate as ever to get their hands on NVDA GPUs," Bespoke added. The market for GPUs, however, may not be as strong as it once was. Bespoke notes that the cost to rent GPU’s has been declining, and a look at the Silicon Data H100 Rental Index, which tracks the hourly cost of renting a graphics processing unit, suggests that is accurate. The index climbed to $2.89 an hour in mid-April, but was down to $2.41 one month later, before slipping to $2.15 on Thursday. “Part of that is thanks to the introduction of their Blackwell line, which is generally more efficient, but it remains the case that data centers are chasing falling prices for a given level of capacity," Bespoke added. It’s difficult to predict where Nvidia will go next—and the stock isn’t falling, just lagging. In fact, the concerns may be much ado about nothing. But the market has a way of sniffing out problems before investors do, creating something of a quandry. “It wouldn’t be the first time that a secular winner faces a narrative test before continuing to surge if that ends up playing out," Bespoke wrote. “But we are somewhat surprised at how little attention the underperformance of the largest listed U.S. stock is getting, especially relative to other adjacent names." And now investors have to make sense of Nvidia’s partnership with Intel to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers, an announcement that sent shares up 3.5% on Thursday. It’s almost enough to make one give up on AI altogether. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Is a deal with AI darling Nvidia enough to win investors over to Intel's stock? A $5 billion investment and a promise to co-develop chips for data centers and PCs from the chip designer at the heart of the AI boom sent Intel (INTC) shares soaring 23% to around $31 Thursday. That brought the stock to levels not seen since July 2024, before a wider-than-expected loss and massive restructuring plan announced that August dealt a blow to investor confidence and sent its stock reeling. Roughly a year later, the struggling chipmaker has welcomed a new CEO, laid off workers, and struck a deal with President Donald Trump to sell the government a 10% stake. That inspired enough confidence to bring the stock up 24% this year heading into Thursday's session. Intel was for years a blue-chip stock and a member of the Dow industrials. It's fallen on hard times recently, with the stock at half its 2021 highs. Thursday's vote of confidence from Nvidia, which replaced it in the Dow, could be seen as a turning point not only for the stock but for a company that has struggled to engineer a turnaround. Today's Nvidia-fueled (NVDA) momentum has Intel's year-to-day gains above 50%. Some analysts now think the momentum could mark a turning point in sentiment for the stock, which Wall Street has largely viewed with caution and currently sits at around half of its 2021 highs. All 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha held "hold" ratings for Intel's stock up until Thursday. The Nvidia news is "a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game," Wedbush's Dan Ives told clients in a note Thursday. Wedbush said it expects the move, which could lend Intel some of Nvidia's AI-driven tailwinds, to help stem further losses of Intel's existing market share in server and PC products and boost the company's longer-term prospects. "The chip landscape remains [Nvidia's] world with everybody else paying rent," Ives said. Bernstein analysts led by Stacy Rasgon called the blessing from Nvidia "priceless." Some analysts said Intel may need further support. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead called it a “step in the right direction” in an interview with CNBC Thursday, though he suggested Intel likely requires another $5 billion to $10 billion to build out its chip manufacturing capabilities. However, Moorhead said, there’s now a “pretty long line of people” the chipmaker could turn to in exchange for some concessions. "The question becomes control, ownership, and voting rights," he said. UPDATE: This article has been updated with the latest share price information.
