Title: Bitcoin Miner IREN's AI Push Gains Momentum, Price Target Hiked 60% to $37: Canaccord

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity. The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams. In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75. The company’s mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry’s most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels. Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million. On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs. With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.

Title: Dell Stock Drops as Soft Q3 Profit Projection Offsets Strong AI Demand

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit. The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year. Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand. "We've now shipped $10 billion of AI solutions in the first half of FY26, surpassing all shipments in FY25. This helped deliver another record revenue quarter in our Servers and Networking business, which grew 69%," COO Jeff Clarke said. "Demand for our AI solutions continues to be exceptional, and we're raising our AI server shipment guidance for FY26 to $20 billion" from $15 billion-plus. Citi analysts said in a note Friday that Dell's Q2 PC segment sales were below consensus forecasts "by 3% or roughly $357.0 million," and that it "likely lost share in PCs." It added that the increase in its AI server shipment guidance is good news for Nvidia (NVDA), which makes up 88% of its sales, and Micron Technology (MU), at 17%. "Dell expects the traditional server business to grow in the 2nd half but below their prior expectations from the beginning of the year," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-earnings-sustain-the-ai-stock-rally-just-without-nvidia-11800018
Time Published: 2025-08-28T23:15:37Z

Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday. The results were driven by “strength in migrations,” according to Citi analysts, suggesting “large enterprises' increasing budget allocation towards database modernization as part of AI projects.” UBS analysts pointed to several other reasons, aside from AI hype, to be optimistic about the prospects for technology stocks this year. "Second-quarter earnings for big tech have been robust and broad-based, with most companies beating both sales and EPS estimates," the analysts wrote. They expect tech earnings to grow 15% this year, and hold in the low teens next year. Earnings should be boosted in the near term by U.S. dollar weakness. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 10% since the start of the year, a decline that, by UBS estimates, should translate to a roughly 2.5% increase in the S&P 500's earnings. "We see more room for the US dollar to decline from current levels, with the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle set to kick off next month." High stock valuations have been a recurring source of anxiety for tech investors throughout the AI rally. "Valuations are currently at the upper end of historical ranges," the analysts note, but recent surveys of individual investors and assessments of institutional portfolios suggest there's room for the market to become even more bullish on mega-cap tech stocks.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose as investors digested quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA), the world's highest valued company, and a report showing a positive revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% on Thursday, securing a second straight all-time closing high and finishing a day above 6500 for the first time. The Dow gained 0.2%, joining the broader benchmark index in record closing territory, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%, closing just below its record level. Nvidia, for its part, fell less than 1%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Datadog (DDOG) shares logged the S&P 500's top daily performance, jumping 7%. Thursday's surge for Datadog stock added to gains posted in the previous session following a strong earnings report from fellow database software specialist MongoDB (MDB). Datadog has launched several new products this year that leverage artificial intelligence technology to enhance its platform's database-monitoring capabilities, helping revenue growth. Shares of Fair Isaac (FICO), the data analytics company known for its consumer credit scores, advanced 6.1%. The stock has come under pressure in recent months following criticism of its pricing scheme by William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who announced in July that mortgage lenders would be able to use FICO competitor VantageScore to evaluate the credit of potential borrowers. Some analysts have lately grown more positive on the shares, citing among other reasons its pricing strength for credit evaluations. Agilent Technologies (A) surpassed sales and profit expectations for its fiscal third quarter, and shares of the health sciences company gained 5.3%. The company also issued stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, highlighting strong demand in its pharmaceutical end markets and its chemicals and advanced materials segment. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares plummeted 13%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. The maker of deli meats and parent company of brands including Spam and Skippy reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter, topping revenue estimates but falling short of adjusted profit expectations. The company attributed its lackluster performance to increases in commodity input costs. Hormel expects this trend to continue in the current quarter and said it plans pricing action to address the inflationary pressure. Cooper Companies (COO) lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025, citing soft demand for contact lenses, and shares of the medical device maker dropped nearly 13%. Cooper's revenue for the third quarter also missed analysts' forecasts, although adjusted profit came in slightly ahead of estimates. Citi analysts downgraded Cooper stock to "neutral" from "buy." Shares of Brown-Forman (BF.B) sank 4.9% after the alcoholic beverage maker reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal first quarter. Although the Jack Daniel's parent slightly surpassed estimates with its top-line results for the period, boosted by demand for its ready-to-drink beverages, sales were down from a year ago. The company discussed consumer uncertainty amid the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, noting that the absence of U.S.-made spirits in most Canadian markets added to pressure on its international business.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's Q2 2026 results beat overall expectations, but data center revenue fell short, primarily due to the lack of sales in China.The company's revenue and stock price growth rates are decelerating, with future explosive growth challenged by market saturation and elusive AI investment returns.Re-entry into the Chinese market offers significant revenue upside, but remains subject to geopolitical uncertainties. Nvidia stock fell 1.2% Wednesday after reporting record sales, falling short on data-center revenue, and predicting cooler growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this slight dip represent a buying opportunity? If Nvidia can accelerate revenue growth, its share price will rise. Here are three reasons that may not happen: Nvidia is optimistic about the company’s future. “This year is a record-breaking year,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, reported the Journal. “I expect next year to be a record-breaking year” as well, he added. With the exception of its data center business, Nvidia beat expectations in Q2 2026 and issued slower Q3 growth guidance – still ahead of analyst forecasts. Overall, the chip designer reported “better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%,” according to CNBC. Here are the key numbers: The absence of revenue from China affected Nvidia’s data center results. The company generated $33.8 billion in GPU data center sales – a 1% decline from the first quarter. The company sold $4 billion fewer H20 chips – which are designated for the Chinese market, Nvidia chief financial officer Colleen Kress said in a statement. Nvidia is bullish on its latest GPUs – the Blackwell line. Their revenue increased 17% between the first and second quarters – indicating “demand is extraordinary,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Journal. In May, Nvidia said Blackwell – which accounted for roughly 70% of data center revenue – reached $27 billion in sales, reported CNBC. The company sees tremendous growth ahead. The largest AI companies will spend $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, based on their current level of capital expenditures, and Nvidia could capture “as much as 70% of that revenue,” Huang said, according to the Journal. Will Nvidia’s efforts to revive sales in China succeed? The answer could depend on political considerations. During the quarter, after Huang met with President Donald Trump, Nvidia hinted it may get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. Indeed the president “changed his mind in August and allowed H20 sales to resume after Huang visited the White House and pledged to give the federal government a 15% cut of AI-chip revenue earned in China,” the Journal reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia took $4.5 billion in writedowns because of the lack of sales and said the H20 would have added $8 billion in second-quarter had the company been able to sell them, CNBC noted. Kress told investors Nvidia could generate between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the current quarter if the geopolitical environment permits. Nvidia’s stock price growth depends on the company’s ability to grow faster than investors expect. The company’s growth and stock price have slowed down in parallel. How so? In 2023, Nvidia revenue was up 126%, according to Macrotrends, while the stock soared 230%, noted Google Finance. In 2024, the company’s revenue increased 113% while its stock price rose 194%. In the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased 56% and the stock has risen 29% so far this year. This suggests the stock will keep going up more slowly unless Nvidia can grow much faster. However, if the company resumed growing at 100% a year for the next decade, revenue would soar from $176 billion in the last year to $360 trillion in 2036. Sadly, such growth is impossible unless Nvidia targets new – much larger markets. After all, the global market for semiconductors is around $600 billion – much smaller than the gigantic 2036 revenue figure. Will Nvidia’s data center growth decelerate significantly? The answer depends on whether companies remain as eager as they now appear to be to use AI chatbots. For instance, enterprise technology spending grew 75% to $4.9 trillion in 2024 while large technology companies boosted AI capital expenditures from $245 billion in 2024 to $320 billion in 2025, according to Computerworld. Unfortunately, these capital expenditures have not yielded profits. That’s because 95% of companies surveyed received no return on their AI investment. Only 5% of companies generated returns on AI – which averaged 3.7 times what they invested, noted a report from the MIT NANDA Institute. If the economy contracts due to rising tariff-induced inflation and return on AI remains small, will companies keep spending so much on the technology? If companies cut back on their AI spending, it is only a matter of time before such a slowdown reduces Nvidia’s data center revenue growth even more? Investors see some upside in the stock. Nvidia’s shares could rise about 14% to reach the average price target of $205 per share set by 31 analysts covered by TipRanks. In my view the biggest potential for upside would happen if the Chinese market reopens for Nvidia. Unfortunately, that market could continue to be a political football. Unless Nvidia can find new growth opportunities, the best days of owning its stock may be in the rear view mirror.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground Thursday morning even as the AI chipmaker and investor favorite reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates. While the results, released late Wednesday, broadly came in slightly better than expected, sales in the data center segment, which comprise the bulk of the company's revenue, were slightly below Wall Street estimates. The outlook for the current quarter—which excludes sales of H20 chips to China amid uncertainty about whether exports to the country will resume—also disappointed some investors. Market participants have come to expect that Nvidia's results and guidance will always blow past expectations. Nvidia shares were down 1.5% at around $179 in midday trading. Coming into today's session the stock had gained 35% since the start of the year, making it the biggest gainer among members of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap technology stocks, amid booming demand from major companies building their AI infrastructure. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and use technical analysis to point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After registering a fresh all-time high earlier this month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways, indicating apprehension among market participants ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results. While the relative strength index remained in bullish territory leading into earnings, the indicator had made consistently lower highs since topping out in mid-July, signaling weakening buying momentum. Let’s identify key support levels to watch and point out an important overhead area worth eyeing if the stock rallies. Initial earnings-driven selling could see the shares test key support around $174. This area may attract buying interest near the mid-July peak and a minor retracement in the stock last week. A close below this location may lead to a retest of support at the $159 level. Investors could look for entry points in this area near the June high, which preceded a brief two-day dip before the stock resumed its uptrend. Further selling opens the door for a decline to the key $150 level. The shares would likely encounter support in this region never multiple peaks that formed on the chart between November and January. Interestingly, this level closely aligns with a downside bars pattern target that takes the move lower following the chipmaker’s 2024 third-quarter earnings report and repositions it from the stock’s recent highs. This analysis provides clues as to how a similar post-earnings profit-taking phase may unfold. If Nvidia shares resume their longer-term move higher, investors should eye the $183 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s recent trading levels just below the record high.

Title: Why Wall Street is boosting forecasts for Nvidia stock even higher after a lukewarm reaction to earnings

For a company like Nvidia, which is used to blowing the doors off earnings reports, Wednesday wasn't the best day. While the chipmaking giant beat second-quarter revenue and earnings, the vibes were lukewarm at best, and the move in the stock price showed it. Shares quickly slid as much as 4% in the after-market before recovering a bit. They remained about 1% lower in regular Thursday trading. But if there's anything to worry about, analysts are shrugging it off. The broad consensus across Wall Street is that Nvidia's earnings report was good enough to unlock further stock upside in the future. Below is a sampling of this bullish push — five banks that raised their price targets in the immediate aftermath of Nvidia earnings, and why they did so. Rating: Overweight New price target: $215 (up from $170) Reasoning: JPMorgan sees enough demand for Nvidia's Blackwell products to support the company's revenue guidance of $54 billion for the following quarter. Demand for Nvidia's H20 chip, meanwhile, could provide as much as $2 billion to $5 billion in extra revenue for the following quarter, analysts estimated, despite uncertainty surrounding US trade restrictions with China. "Overall, we believe NVIDIA's 12-month forward order book continues to outstrip supply," the bank wrote in a client note. "All in, the playbook remains the same here for NVDA - a solid beat and raise with multiple levers at play to drive upside, against the backdrop of a multi-year runway of growth for AI infrastructure spending, with NVDA in our view continuing to capture a significant majority of the incremental spend," it added. Rating: Neutral New price target: $195 (up from $135) Reasoning: DA Davidson, which once said it believed 2025 would be a "peak year" in the AI cycle, said it no longer believed that to be the case. "While we are maintaining our Neutral rating we would like to highlight our perspective on NVDA has shifted quite a bit over the last 6 months," analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. "We now believe demand growth for inference will sustain for the foreseeable future," it added, pointing to progress made on AI models over the last year. Rating: Buy New price target: $240 (up from $235) Reasoning: The research firm highlighted Jensen Huang's comments on Nvidia's earnings call, where the CEO estimated that capex on data centers could boom to around $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The chipmaker also said it saw a $2 trillion total addressable market in the computing and networking business. That could "portend to big numbers" for Nvidia, Melius added, reiterating its forecast that the company's annual revenue could surpass $600 billion by the end of the decade. "People will regret focusing on the near-term," analysts wrote on Thursday. "We reiterate our Buy rating and are still excited about Sovereign and hyperscaler demand driving upside for multiple years," the firm added, though it noted it was taking out China as part of its estimates for the firm going forward. Rating: Buy New price target: $228 (up from $210) Reasoning: Nvidia still has "significant growth potential," Truist analysts wrote, despite the firm's latest guidance falling slightly below expectations. "We recognize this as a minor imperfection, and instead focus on management's resilient longer-term outlook," the firm said in a note on Wednesday. The firm highlighted 3 catalysts that could take Nvidia higher over the long run: "NVDA remains *the* AI company. Buy," the note added. Rating: Overweight New price target: $210 (up from $206) Reasoning: Nvidia handily "cleared the bar" with its second-quarter results, despite doubts looming over China, Morgan Stanley said. In a note to clients, analysts said they believed Nvidia's earnings-per-share valuation was still supported by improving gross profit margins and demand growth for its products, like the company's Blackwell ramp. Nvidia also remains on track to launch its Rubin chip next year, and demand for AI computing is still growing, analysts noted. "Nvidia has a tendency to rerate quickly when there is a wall of worry to climb; we don't have that today," analysts wrote in a note. "It's easier to make the case for upside when there is a fundamental overhang on the stock, but even without one the financial profile of mid 50s+ % y/y growth in revenue with >60% operating margins will remain attractive as long as beats and raises continue - where our confidence remains high."

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Did Nvidia Just Pop an AI Bubble? Here’s What the Market Says

Lukewarm second quarter results from AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) Wednesday have Wall Street bros and the analysts that love them catching all kinds of feelings. Long a bellwether for how the market views AI in general, the largest company in the world carries enough weight in its $1 trillion valuation to move entire indexes, let alone the tech sector. That was especially the case over the last two weeks, when handwringing over what Nvidia would say in its second quarter results on Aug. 27 reached a fever pitch. The TLDR take on what all that was and why it matters? Numbers that showed strong growth from Nvidia were good for AI’s continued bull run; weak numbers would mean that the casino-level spending on AI is finally showing signs of a slowdown. With investors like the U.S. government and Meta, Google, and the private market plowing billions into AI and its tools, it’s always wise to pause for a minute and see what the short-term projections may be for such a hot sector. Well, as is usually the case with analyzing Wall Street, that really depends on who you ask. Overall, Nvidia managed to surpass market consensus, with reported Q2 sales of $46.74 billion, up 56% from a year ago, a number that eked past the market’s projected consensus of $46.23 billion. Of that number, roughly $41.1 billion was from the companyâs data centers business, which missed its expected target of $41.29 billion. For some tech sector watchers, that disparity (while considered relatively minor in other businesses) was enough to raise alarm bells that a spending Ice Age could be drawing nigh. â[Data center operator spending] could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,â Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne wrote in a note to investors. To others, however, Nvidia’s results were actually a reassuring sign that AI spending and the investors, banks, and VCs funding it have very little to fear from these particular results. “I don’t care about the seemingly sky-high market capitalization that these stocks have. I’m simply trying to put a valuation on a company that makes what you need to become one of the serious players in AI,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said after parsing earnings. “I learned not to question Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Meta or even Tesla â the big customers â a long time ago.

With data center and growths numbers like the ones posted Wednesday, the outlook surrounding Nvidiaâs earnings has heightened fears that the current surge in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be unsustainable in the long run. You can now expect a growing chorus of analysts to question whether valuations are justified by actual revenue potential, especially amid broader economic uncertainties. Nvidia’s outlook for its business in China was also a key part of its Q2 guidance and highlighted two potentially major hurdles to growth: Disappointing numbers reported from that region, and a continuing uncertainty on what it might expect from American domestic policies. Specifically worrisome is that, despite the Trump administration recently easing restrictions on exports of certain AI chips to Beijing, this policy shift has yet to produce a meaningful recovery in Nvidiaâs revenue from the region. The lingering difficulties in the Chinese market also continue to cast a shadow over the companyâs growth prospects, highlighting how geopolitical tensions remain a significant headwind for the semiconductor giant. artificial intellienceemerging technologiesNvidia Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: 5 biggest takeaways from the Nvidia Q2 earnings call

Nvidia exceeded expectations once again in its second quarter of 2025, but China remains a question mark. On Wednesday, the chipmaking giant reported $46.74 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both beating analyst estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter sales of about $54 billion. Despite the upbeat earnings, Nvidia shares slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of forecasts for a second straight quarter, and as signs of slowing growth began to show. From the uncertainties around the H20 chips' shipment to China to the spending on AI infrastructure, here are the main takeaways from the chipmaking giant's earnings call. Colette Kress, the chief financial officer, said Nvidia has yet to ship any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers recently receiving licenses. On the earnings call, she said that shipments worth $2 billion to $5 billion could flow if restrictions ease, but the company has excluded that revenue from its third-quarter forecast. The company has also floated a 15% remittance to the US government on licensed sales, though no rule has been finalized. "We just have to keep advocating," CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," Huang added. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. Nvidia projected its Q3 revenue at $54 billion with a 2% margin, exceeding analysts' expectations of $53.4 billion. However, the company said its projections didn't include H20 sales to China, which are still uncertain. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told BI that he sees some parallels between Nvidia's current shares and times when Tesla would have strong financials but slowing guidance, which slows the growth in share prices. "Now NVDA is 'only' growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100%+ revenue growth from last year," said Mulberry. "As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock." Nvidia expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, said Kress. The CFO called it a "significant long-term growth opportunity." Her comments come as Big Tech ramps up spending in AI and fuels GDP growth, though some tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned that some investors may be overhyping the sector. Earlier this week, JPMorgan wrote in a note that the high capex spending points to strong growth forecasts in AI. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending," the bank wrote. "This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries." The build-out of AI models has powered Nvidia's growth in the last several years. Now comes robotics. "Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform," Kress said during the call. Robotics remains a small part of Nvidia's business, but Huang and Kress said they're seeing signs of growth. Jetson AGX Thor, Nvidia's latest robotics computing platform or "robot brain," was released earlier this week. Kress said the adoption of Thor "is growing at rapid rate," with more than 2 million developers taking the platform to market. The CFO also said automotive revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $586 million, primarily thanks to self-driving cars. Kress said Nvidia's successor to its popular Blackwell chip architecture, Rubin, is on track for volume production in 2026, giving investors the innovation, predictable product cycle, and revenue generator they like to see. While the earnings call didn't provide many details around the next-generation chip, Kress said the chips are "in fab," meaning that the manufacturing process has begun. "This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software," Kress said. Jump to
