At GTC 2025 in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 20), Nvidia (NVDA) hosted its first ever Quantum Day, an event to explore how quantum technology could impact industries. It featured a panel discussion led by CEO Jensen Huang, alongside executives from leading quantum computing companies like Atom Computing, D-Wave, Infleqtion, QuEra, IonQ, Pasqal and Quantinuum. Huang took the stage to clarify his statement in January that practical quantum computers were still 15 to 30 years away—which caused the stock prices of several quantum computing companies to plummet.

When stocks went down, I didn’t even realize these companies were public,” said Jensen. “Today, I am here to invite every quantum company CEO to prove me wrong. This panel is a therapy session for me,” he added jokingly. But more importantly, Huang announced that Nvidia is investing in a new Boston-based research facility to accelerate quantum computing innovations. The Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC) will focus on integrating A.I. supercomputing with quantum systems, particularly emphasizing quantum error correction—a critical hurdle in making quantum computing practical. The new center will collaborate with Harvard’s Quantum Initiative and MIT’s Engineering Quantum Systems group and quantum companies including Quantinuum, Quantum Machines and QuEra Computing. Huang first welcomed Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, with a smile and a handshake. During the panel discussion, Baratz pointed to scientific applications where quantum computing is already playing a vital role. “There are problems in the world today that classical computing, or even A.I. alone, can’t solve,” said Baratz. “Think about accurate weather forecasting or drug discovery. Quantum computing can also help A.I. models become more power-efficient.” The panelists largely agreed that quantum technology has made major progress in recent months—but full-scale practicality is still in development. “We’ve achieved 99.5 percent accuracy in qubit fidelity,” said Subodh Kulkarni, CEO of Rigetti Computing. “But yes, [quantum computers] haven’t reached full practicality yet.” Qubits are fundamental units of data in quantum computers, that can exist in multiple states at once, enabling computers to process complex calculations more efficiently. For quantum computing to become truly practical and surpass the capabilities of classical computers or A.I., qubits must be scaled into the thousands, said Ben Bloom, CEO of Atom Computing. Meanwhile, Loïc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal, a Paris-based startup specializing in neutral atoms quantum computing, said his company is already set to deliver four to six fully functional quantum machines over the next few months to the French government and other clients. Unlike Microsoft and Google, which are actively developing quantum hardware, Nvidia has so far focused on software solutions. However, the chipmaker’s increasing involvement in quantum suggests it now sees the technology as a complement, not a competitor, to A.I. and classical computers. “Quantum computing will augment A.I. supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Huang said in a statement earlier this week. Huang closed the session with a challenge to the industry: quantum computing must prove its real-world value. He also urged realism in the industry’s expectations. “The quantum industry has to find markets where this technology delivers real impact,” he said. “We need to lower our expectations for the present and focus on how to build these systems for the greater good. It seems like next year we’re going to have some quantum demos at GTC.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: HCA Healthcare Is One Healthy Business

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer , Contributor. CHINA - 2024/06/23: In this photo illustration, the American healthcare business HCA Healthcare ... [+] (NYSE: HCA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) One of the biggest losers from the Mag 7 during earnings season was Nvidia (NVDA). I called a top for NVDA back in August 2024 and am not surprised to see it fall precipitously after reporting excellent earnings. The narrative that valuation does not matter is being disproved before our very eyes – along with many other false narratives that have plagued our society. If you’ve been following my reports on the company’s stock, you would know that the recent drop in price is still not nearly enough to make the stock attractive. NVDA is not alone. Crowded trades and overvalued stocks are everywhere. Good stocks are harder and harder to find as the market was hitting new highs. Accordingly, I see opportunity in market pull backs. I see a golden era for stocks over the next couple of years as markets exorcise more false narratives (remember NFTs…haha) and embrace fundamentals again. Meanwhile, my firm’s proven-superior research continues to give an edge in finding good stocks. I work harder and smarter with my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI to scour the markets and the data to identify the stocks, ETFs and mutual funds with the best risk/reward. I previously made HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA) a Long Idea in June 2020, and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my original report, HCA has outperformed as a Long Idea by 137%, rising 224% while the S&P is up 87%. Even after outpacing the overall market, HCA Healthcare remains a strong business and very attractive stock. HCA Healthcare has steadily grown its top- and bottom-line since 2007. HCA Healthcare has grown revenue by 6% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 8% compounded annually since 2007. See Figure 1. The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 10.2% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2024 while increasing invested capital turns from 1.32 to 1.48 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 13% in 2007 to 18% in 2024. Figure 1: HCA Healthcare’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2007 HCA Revenue & NOPAT 2007-2024 Year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, HCA Healthcare’s: Longer-term, the company has grown its admissions (general measure of inpatient volume) YoY in 8 out of the last 10 years. HCA Healthcare’s total admissions grew from 1.8 million in 2014 to 2.2 million in 2024, or 2% compounded annually. Over the same time, the company has expanded the number of hospitals it operates from 166 to 190. See Figure 2. Figure 2: HCA Healthcare’s Number of Admissions and Hospitals: 2014 – 2024 HCA Admissions & Hospitals 2014-2024 Hospital operators, such as HCA Healthcare, benefit from consistent, and long-term, tailwinds of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In 2022, 17% of the U.S population was 65 years or older. That percentage is expected to increase to 22% by 2040. The population of those aged 85+ is also expected to double from 2022 to 2040. As populations age, healthcare spending increases. In fact, per capita healthcare spending for those aged 65-84 is 1.6x higher than those aged 45-64 and 3.1x higher than those aged 19-44. Rising spend from an aging population drives projections for continued growth in hospital spending. According to the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker, the annual hospital spending is expected to grow: With its industry leading position and superior profitability (more on that below), HCA Healthcare is well-positioned to capitalize on steady growth in healthcare spending for years to come. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare has paid $3.8 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.35/share in February 2018 to $0.72/share in March 2025. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield. HCA also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $28.1 billion (34% of market cap) of shares. $16.9 billion of this repurchase activity occurred from 2022-2024. In January 2025, HCA Healthcare’s board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. Management noted in the 4Q24 earnings call that they “anticipate completing a significant portion in 2025.” Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, it would repurchase $6.0 billion of shares in 2025, which equals 7.3% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.1%. HCA generates enough free cash flow (FCF) to cover both its share repurchases and regular dividend payments. From 2018 to 2024, HCA generated $30.9 billion in FCF while paying $3.8 billion in dividends and $28.1 billion in repurchases, for total capital return of $31.9 billion. I like companies that choose to return so much capital to shareholders instead of spending it on executive bonuses or acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: HCA Healthcare’s Free Cash Flow Vs. Cash Dividends Paid: 2018 Through 2024 HCA FCF and Dividends 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every year of my model on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, the company has generated positive FCF in 46 of the past 52 quarters. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare generated $30.9 billion (23% of enterprise value) in FCF. See Figure 4. Figure 4: HCA Healthcare’s Cumulative FCF Since 2018 HCA Free Cash Flow 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare was the most profitable healthcare company amongst its peers when I originally wrote my Long Idea report, and it remains #1 today. It is also the largest hospital operator by revenue and number of locations. HCA Healthcare’s ROIC and invested capital turns are higher than all peers, while the company’s NOPAT margin surpasses all but one of its publicly traded competitors. Competitors in this analysis include Encompass Health (EHC), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Universal Health Services (UHS), and more, per Figure 5. Figure 5: HCA Healthcare’s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) HCA Profitability vs Competitors Skilled labor in the healthcare industry remains in short supply. Job satisfaction for Registered Nurses (RN) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) remains low since COVID-19 due to increased levels of stress and excessive work hours. Many nurses also left the workforce after Covid. Worse yet, a significant segment of the nursing workforce is nearing retirement age, while too few new nurses are entering the workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demand for RN and APRN services. Hiring enough labor continues to be a headwind for the whole healthcare industry, including HCA. However, the company is taking steps to recruit and retain quality employees. In the 4Q24 earnings call, management noted that employee engagement is “at an all-time high”, which has allowed the company to “reduce turnover and improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing…” Furthermore, the company continues to hire nurses from Galen College, one of the largest nursing schools in the U.S., in which HCA Healthcare acquired a majority stake in 2020. The cost of goods is rising, and the potential for newly administered tariffs to drive costs even higher remains a risk for many companies. In the 4Q24 earnings call, HCA Healthcare management noted that they’ve been working on tariff mitigation strategies for years to manage the cost of supplies needed to operate its hospitals. Importantly, management noted that in 2025, 70% of its supplies are already contracted with firm pricing, which could help mitigate any increased supply cost when and if mass tariffs are enacted. Importantly, HCA Healthcare is already priced as if tariffs and labor costs will hurt the business and result in deteriorating profitability. Management’s ability to mitigate these challenges creates increased upside in shares, as I’ll show below. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for HCA. At its current price, HCA’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For context, HCA has grown its NOPAT by 8% compounded annually since 2014 and 7% compounded annually since 2007. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $319/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 5.7% growth in 2025 and 5.1% growth in 2026. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock is worth $435/share today – a 36% upside to the current price. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT would grow 4% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.

Economists, consumers, and business leaders are antsy. Wall Street analysts are bullish. Of the 12,320 analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks, 55.7% of them are Buy ratings, according to a recent report from FactSet Research. If that holds through the end of the month, it will represent the highest month-end percentage of Buy ratings since August 2022. Another read: The share of Buy ratings is currently above its 5-year average (55%), according to FactSet, while the shares of Hold and Sell ratings are below their 5-year averages (39.1% and 5.9%, respectively). The S&P 500 fell into a correction last week amid growing concerns about the Trump administration’s tariff policies and the potential they’ll raise prices and slow economic growth. President Trump and his deputies have fueled the market’s anxiety by repeatedly acknowledging that tariffs might cause economic pain, but that they’ll go through with them anyway. Big tech stocks have been hit particularly hard this year: The Magnificent Seven, for example, fell into a correction weeks before the S&P 500. Yet they remain among the stocks analysts are the most bullish on. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the S&P 500’s fourth, fifth, and sixth highest-rated stocks, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the analyst ratings on Microsoft and Amazon stocks are Buys, just slightly higher than Nvidia’s share (93%). Not a single Wall Street analyst recommends selling those stocks, according to FactSet's calculations. The tech sector is the second-highest rated sector—63% of ratings are Buys—bested only by energy, with 65%. Meanwhile consumer staples, a traditionally defensive sector that tends to outperform when investors expect a recession, has the lowest share of Buy ratings (41%). That discrepancy tracks with a recent report from Bank of America suggesting investors bought up cyclical stocks and sold defensives during last week’s sell-off.

Title: Nvidia bets on quantum computing with new Boston research center

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) is partnering with quantum computing companies Quantinuum, QuEra Computing, and more to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers. The Nvidia Accelerated Research Quantum Center, or NVAQC for short, will strive to make large-scale, useful, accelerated quantum supercomputers. “Quantum computing will augment AI supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. Major quantum companies will provide researchers from Harvard and MIT with “unprecedented access to the technologies and expertise needed to solve the challenges of useful quantum computing,” MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science William Oliver said in a prepared statement. The move might come as a surprise to some, considering the Nvidia chief’s comments voicing uncertainty in the near-term applicability of quantum computing mere months ago. Earlier this year, Huang made headlines and tanked quantum stocks with his assessment that useful quantum computers were at least 15 to 30 years away. But he seems to have regretted his words as he hosted a league of quantum computing executives on Thursday at the first “quantum day” as part of the company’s GPU tech conference (GTC). Huang started the panel on Thursday by apologizing for his comments, going on to say that this was “the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong.” It’s uncertain if investors are convinced, though: Quantum computing stocks IonQ (IONQ+3.60%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-1.17%) ended the day down more than 9% on Thursday following the panel. The center will be operational later this year, but the “plumbing for this has been in place for a while,” according to Rajeeb Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum — a founding partner of the center and a privately held company born through a merger of U.S.-based Honeywell (HON-0.29%) quantum solutions and U.K.-based Cambrige Quantum. Quantinuum’s technology has been integrated with Nvidia’s open-source quantum development platform CUDA-Q since 2022, the same system that will be used at the research center. The center will be accelerating research in two areas, according to Hazra: making quantum computers better and more error resilient, and developing specific use-cases for these computers in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and carbon sequestration technology. While he acknowledges that there is more work to be done, Hazra is more optimistic than Huang on the timeline for quantum-computing usability. “I think Jensen’s postulate was getting useful work out is a long time away. We disagree, because we are getting useful work out today, and particularly with the combination of classical and quantum computers,” Hazra said. Quantinuum says that the company’s trapped-ion quantum computers are doing work that cannot be simulated on classical computers as of 2024. “So by running a quantum computer, you are now generating unique data you could have never had before,” he said. Hazra also expects to use the center as a “premier test bed to accelerate” generative AI systems that use quantum computing. Hazra and a slew of other tech executives, like IBM (IBM-0.37%) CEO Arvind Krishna, are bullish about the potential for discovery that comes from “turbocharging AI with quantum data.” Quantum computers work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. They not only are significantly faster than classical computers in some circumstances, they also have the potential to go beyond already produced knowledge, to then give artificial intelligence agents insights about nature on a subatomic level.

Micron Technology (MU) reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates and issued a better-than-expected outlook, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner saw its fiscal second-quarter revenue jump 38% year-over-year to $8.05 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted earnings of $1.78 billion, or $1.56 per share, rose from $476 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier, also beating projections. The gains came as data center sales tripled year-over-year, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence. In the current quarter, Micron expects revenue of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 to $1.67. By comparison, analysts called for revenue of $8.53 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.51 per share. Micron shares surged over 5% in extended trading Thursday following the release. They've gained 22% in 2025 through the closing bell.

Title: Fewer NVIDIA AI GPUs Needed After DeepSeek, Says $600 Billion Chinese Tech Firm’s Strategy Head

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Despite mega cap US firms allocating billions of dollars in capital expenditure spending for AI GPUs, Chinese multinational technology firm Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell believes that DeepSeek's AI breakthroughs demonstrate that such spending might not be needed. DeepSeek's claims of having developed its AI models similar in capabilities to some American counterparts but at a fraction of a cost appear to have permanently altered the stock market. Their biggest victim was NVIDIA's stock, which has yet to recover nearly $600 billion in losses during January's selloff. NVIDIA's GTC conference earlier this week failed to impress investors either, and the stock has remained flat despite CEO Jensen Huang pointing out multiple trillion dollar markets for his firm's products. In a recent talk, Tencent CSO James Mitchell shared that one use case his firm had for spending money on NVIDIA's AI GPUs was to train large language models or LLMs. Tencent released its Hunyuan Turbo S AI model a little over a month after DeepSeek's products gained popularity in January. The firm aimed at the Chinese startup with its products as it claimed that its model could respond to queries in less than a second. However, while competing with DeepSeek to develop the fastest AI models, Tencent also believes that the startup's training breakthroughs significantly reduce AI development costs. DeepSeek claims to have reduced AI development costs by using advanced software engineering, which allowed it to access a GPU's core functions. Typically, engineers rely on NVIDIA's CUDA software to use the chips, but the convenience comes at the expense of tighter control over the products. Commenting on capital spending for AI GPUs, Mitchell shared that "A second use of CapEx was GPUs for large language model training," This use case was important before DeepSeek shared its model development process. The Tencent CSO added that "there was a period of time last year when there was a belief that every new generation of large language model required an order of magnitude more GPUs." However, according to him, DeepSeek changed this perception, at least among Chinese firms. "That period of time ended with the breakthroughs that DeepSeek demonstrated," Mitchell said. While he didn't share how, Mitchell outlined that after the breakthroughs, "the industry and we within the industry are getting much higher productivity on a large language model training from existing GPUs without needing to add additional GPUs at the pace previously expected." Chinese firms are restricted from buying NVIDIA's latest AI GPUs, such as its Blackwell and Hopper products. The restrictions have forced them to rely on older chips or large GPU clusters to overcome the limitations of limited computing power. Tencent has claimed that its Turbo S model has beaten DeepSeek's products in math, reasoning and other AI capabilities. Industry sources believe Chinese firms are interested in working with Huawei and its Ascend AI chips as they navigate the chip blockade. Like NVIDIA, Huawei also offers its chip customers with software to control the chips. However, purportedly, DeepSeek has tested the software and found it lagging to NVIDIA's products. NVIDIA's shares, on the other hand, are yet to recover their pre-January selloff highs. The stock is down by 14% year-to-date as investors wait for more data for its demand to materialize. Mitchell's firm trades on the OTC markets and has a market cap of $601 billion. James Mitchell of Tencent quite clearly laying out the bear case for $NVDA - DeepSeek's innovations mean fewer GPUs needed vs. what Tencent previously thought, despite the explosion in AI usage. @doodlestein "There was a period of time last year when there was a belief that… pic.twitter.com/f80UXyQ8Ny — Timothy Liu (@timothyhliu5) March 20, 2025 Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Stocks changed direction and rose after existing-home sales unexpectedly picked up in February to an annualized rate of 4.26 million. Weekly jobless claims didn’t increase by as much as expected, and the Philadelphia Fed index dropped by less than estimated, to 12.5 in March from 18.1 last month. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all advanced. Here are some stocks to watch today: Accenture’s (ACN+0.71%) shares fell 9.8% after the consulting firm said the Trump Administration is delaying and canceling new contracts amid its push to cut government spending. Darden Restaurants’ (DRI+0.53%) stock jumped 6.9% as investors remained confident in the company’s prospects despite fiscal third-quarter numbers that missed expectations by some measures. Same-store sales growth of 0.7% fell short of the consensus estimate of 1.7%, as Olive Garden and LongHorn SteakHouse both missed expectations. FedEx (FDX-6.64%) stock gained about 0.5%. The delivery service is scheduled to report earnings after the close today. Both earnings per share and revenue are expected to increase year over year, according to a Zacks consensus estimate. Micron’s shares (MU-8.15%) gained 1.8%. The chipmaker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the market closes today, with analysts estimate that per-share earnings and revenue will be in the middle of the forecast range. Nike’s (NKE-5.58%) stock edged higher. The shoemaker is scheduled to publish quarterly earnings after the market closes today. Bank of America (BAC+0.05%) analysts said the results matter less than the company’s message about its product reset and evidence its new offerings are resonating with consumers. Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, out of about $500 billion of total electronics procurement, CEO Jensen Huang told the FT. The stock gained 0.8%. QXO’s shares gained about 4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the building products distributor had reached an agreement to buy Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN-0.06%) for $124.35 a share. Beacon gained 1.9% to $123.83. PDD Holdings’ ADRs gained 1.9% even after the Temu (PDD-3.83%) owner’s quarterly revenue missed expectations Tesla (TSLA+3.88%) swung between gains and losses after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recommended investors buy stock in Elon Musk’s EV-maker, saying in a Fox News interview on Wednesday evening that “it’ll never be this cheap again.” And an analyst has some advice for Musk. Zeekr’s (ZK) stock fell about 8.1% even after the Geely Auto EV unit reported fourth-quarter revenue that exceeded expectations as vehicle deliveries doubled year-over-year.

Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era. This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield. "Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think," Chen added.

Published: March 19, 2025 by Josh Melton, Zachary Jacobson, Jacob Kranzler, Niko Dyundev, David Rogers, Shiv Trisal, Mayank Tahilramani (NVIDIA) and Joel Caruso (NVIDIA) Share this post Keep up with us The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks Data Intelligence Platform integration combines synthetic data creation with enterprise AI capabilities in a simple-to-deploy, easy-to-maintain architecture. With NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, Databricks users can leverage high-fidelity, physics-accurate simulations to parameterize synthetically generated data for vision model training. Training AI models for real-world applications require vast amounts of labeled data, which can be costly, time-consuming, and difficult to obtain at scale. Synthetic data generation in simulated environments offers a powerful alternative by enabling AI models to learn from physically accurate, controlled, and scalable virtual datasets before deployment. Leveraging Omniverse Replicator, a core extension of Isaac Sim, a reference robotic simulation application, with the Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform provides an end-to-end workflow for developing domain-specific AI models in industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare diagnostics, and robotics. By combining synthetic data generation, automated AI workflows, and scalable cloud infrastructure, organizations can accelerate AI development while reducing data acquisition challenges and improving model accuracy. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration, real-world applications, and demonstrates how the collaboration between Databricks and NVIDIA is supercharging machine vision applications. By fusing Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform with NVIDIA’s unparalleled high-performance computing, enterprises can now build, train, and deploy vision models at speeds previously thought impossible. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration and its real-world applications. The technical foundations of the integration start with a reference architecture that defines interfaces, data models, and communication protocols. Below is a generalized workflow that demonstrates the integration of applications developed with NVIDIA Omniverse and the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to provide an end-to-end AI model training pipeline. The steps within the workflow are as follows: Within this architecture, Delta Lake is used as the integration layer between NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks. We bridge the two platforms by leveraging a prototype, custom writer, which allows an application developed with Omniverse to write synthetic data directly into the Lakehouse. Using this approach, instead of writing the data to disk in the form of PNG and NumPy files, Omniverse powered applications can write the generated synthetic images and corresponding metadata into Delta Lake format. The files land directly into cloud storage and are registered to Unity Catalog where they are further processed using Databricks so they are available for downstream model training. The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks integration establishes a new paradigm for machine vision development encompassing synthetic data generation and easy-to-use, industrial-grade AI. Within manufacturing environments, defect detection models often encounter three primary challenges: identifying new defects, adapting to new products, and performing in diverse real-world environments. To tackle these challenges, the NVIDIA Omniverse platform enables customers to build custom synthetic generation pipelines. NVIDIA Omniverse enables developers to create entirely new camera angles, lighting conditions, and physical scenarios in their applications, significantly enhancing model robustness and adaptability beyond traditional methods, such as rotating or brightening images. By automating image generation, the synthetic data generation process becomes a tunable parameter within Databricks’ Managed MLflow. These adjustments can be made alongside traditional hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size. As you identify which variations impact model accuracy, you can refine your training approach to focus on the most effective combinations of synthetic data and hyperparameters while minimizing time spent on less productive configurations. By having synthetic data as a tunable parameter, new use cases are unlocked for manufacturers without disrupting actual operations: These approaches enable manufacturers to train a broader variety of machine vision models to solve business problems proactively. Rare defects with data that was previously too sparse to train on can now be augmented with numerous realistic examples, allowing businesses to catch defects before they escape while preparing enterprises for the new age of Data Intelligence. Siemens Healthineers, a joint healthcare customer of Databricks and NVIDIA inspired this integration architecture after experiencing challenges. The fragmented workflow—with one engineer generating synthetic data through an application developed with NVIDIA Omniverse on-premises and another moving that data to the cloud for ML training and deployment in Databricks—created delays. By implementing Databricks Unity Catalog to centralize all data, functions, and models under a single governance framework and directly integrating the Omniverse platform’s synthetic data generation capabilities, the organization dramatically reduced model iteration cycles "from weeks to days," improved data integration and traceability, and accelerated time to market.

Thousands of attendees packed into a hockey arena in San Jose, Calif. yesterday (March 18) to hear from Jensen Huang kick off Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, GTC. Dubbed the “Super Bowl of A.I.” by the CEO, the event’s audience also included the grandchildren of Vera Rubin, a famed astronomer for whom Nvidia’s upcoming GPU architecture is named. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Naming chips after prominent scientists has been a decades-long tradition at Nvidia. Following its upcoming Rubin GPUs, set for release in late 2026, the company plans to introduce a successor architecture named after theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, Huang revealed yesterday. The in-production Blackwell chip, unveiled at last year’s GTC, is named for mathematician David Blackwell. Since 1998, Nvidia has drawn naming inspiration from computer scientists, mathematicians, astronomers and physicists since 1998. These scientific figures are such a core part of Nvidia’s culture that their faces appear on employee-only company merchandise labeled with the names of Nvidia’s “heroes.” Early architectures took cues from icons like Nikola Tesla and Johannes Kepler, while more recent product lines have spotlighted women in science, including GPUs named after Vera Rubin, Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace. Here’s a closer look at some of the scientists who have been honored by the chipmaking giant over the past few years: Contributions to quantum electrodynamics were among the many accomplishments of Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist who died in 1988 at age 69. He received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his efforts in the field. Feynman additionally worked on the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, during World War II. Most of the American public, however, first became aware of the scientist when he served on a presidential commission investigating the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Vera Rubin is most well-known for having provided evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe. Working alongside astronomer Kent Ford in the 1960s, the duo came across the discovery after studying more than 60 galaxies. A pioneering female astronomer, Rubin was the first woman to serve as scientist staffer at the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and in 1993 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She died in 2016 at age 88. Nvidia’s sought-after Blackwell chips were inspired by David Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who died in 2010 at age 91. In addition to groundbreaking contributions to game theory, probability theory and information theory, Blackwell penned one of the first-ever textbooks on Bayesian statistics in 1969. He also set milestones in the science community, becoming the first Black scholar to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. He was also the first Black professor to receive tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the school’s faculty in the 1950s. Nvidia’s Hopper chips, announced in 2022 and more commonly referred to as its H100 GPUs, took its name from computer scientist and naval officer Grace Hopper. She notably worked on Mark I, America’s first electromechanical computer, and the subsequent Mark II and Mark III computers during her time in the Navy. Appointed a Rear Admiral in the 1980s, she was the oldest officer on active duty when she retired in 1986. After leaving the Navy, Hopper worked for the Digital Equipment Corporation until her death in 1992 at age 85. She received the National Medal of Technology from President George Bush the year prior for her contributions to computer programming languages. When it came to naming its Ada architecture three years ago, Nvidia went back to the 19th-century to draw inspiration from the 1800s mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of British poet Lord Byron, Lovelace—who died in 1843 at age 36—is often recognized as the world’s first computer programmer. Some of her most notable work occurred in 1843, when Lovelace added a set of notes to a translated academic article that laid out what many consider to be the first computer program. Her contributions were rediscovered in the late 1970s, leading the U.S. Department of Defense to name the Ada programming language after her.

Two chipmaking giants are joining forces. Yum! Brands (YUM-0.61%) has tapped Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) to accelerate the use of AI across its global restaurant network. Joe Park, Yum chief digital and technology officer, said the goal of the partnership is to create easier experiences for customers and employees, and provide franchises with “better, faster, cheaper, and safer technology,” while maximizing shareholder returns. The collaboration will focus on three key areas for Yum: voice AI ordering for drive-thrus and call centers, computer vision to optimize operational efficiency, and restaurant intelligence, using AI-generated analytics to boost performance. Pilot programs for these technologies are already underway in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans for a broader rollout targeting 500 restaurants across all Yum brands in the second quarter. Yum also owns KFC and Habit Burger & Grill. Taco Bell has been exploring AI for several years. In July 2024, chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim said Yum had been testing AI voice technology for two years. By then, over 100 Taco Bell drive-thrus in 13 states had already implemented the technology. As the AI race intensifies among tech giants, restaurants are increasingly adopting the technology to stay competitive. AI has already become a mainstay in Big Food, with chains like McDonalds (MCD-0.74%), Chick-fil-A, and Wendy’s (WEN-0.49%) using it to streamline operations, reduce labor costs, and boost efficiency. Chick-fil-A is using robots to cut and squeeze lemons, while Wendy’s is using AI to help it manage Frosty demand. This partnership marks Nvidia’s first venture into the restaurant sector. It also signals a strategic shift for Yum, which has historically built its tech operations through acquisitions. By partnering with Nvidia, Yum will own the AI intelligence created, allowing it to customize the technology to its needs. Although the financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, both Yum and Nvidia have seen stock growth, with Yum up 14% over the past year and Nvidia’s stock rising 35%.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) unveiled more about its next artificial intelligence chips, humanoid robots, and AI supercomputers at its GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday — but some investors wanted more. The chipmaker’s stock fell by more than 3% after the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. The stock reversed course during pre-market trading on Wednesday, and was up by 2.2% at the open. Later in the morning, Nvidia’s shares were up by 1.2%. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company’s Blackwell chips — which were announced at the last GTC — are now in full production after hitting snags last year. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. The chipmaker’s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip. The next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028. “The rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,” Jefferies (JEF+0.71%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. “However, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch “promises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.” However, Windsor said the chipmaker “is showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard” before its competitors can start to catch up. While this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it “a hostage to end demand,” leading to some “tough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,” Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. Bank of America (BAC+0.05%) analysts maintained their “buy” rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show “unmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,” in a note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs “remains extremely robust” and “is currently outstripping supply 15:1” as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips. “In essence, Nvidia’s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it’s Nvidia,” Wedbush said.

Stocks advanced on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement at 2 p.m., which will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose modestly as of 10:52 a.m. — with the all the Magnificent 7 shares except Meta (META+1.39%) rising. The Fed will probably keep interest rates on hold, with investors focused on board members’ rate expectations — the so-called dot plot — and on the central bank’s revised economic forecasts, observers said. Powell’s comments will also be scrutinized. While the Fed governors are expected to keep the key rate at 4.5%, they may opt to pause — or signal a possible pause in May of — quantitative tightening (QT), the sale of financial assets from its balance sheet, economists said. The U.S. economy is definitely softening, but economists are divided as to the direction of inflation and policy, with some projecting three rate cuts starting as soon as the current meeting — which would be a surprise — and others seeing policymakers staying put for longer as prices remain sticky. Here are some stocks to watch today: Autodesk (ADSK-0.23%) stock gained 3.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Starboard Value plans to start a proxy fight at the design-software company. Boeing’s (BA+3.83%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. General Mills (GIS+0.87%) stock fell 1.6% after the food company’s quarterly revenue fell short of expectations and it cut its sales forecast for the year. Gilead (GILD0.00%) stock fell 3.8% after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering cutting spending on domestic HIV prevention. GSK’s (GSK-0.24%) U.S.-listed shares fell about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) stock gained 1%. The chipmaker’s AI conference in San Jose continues Wednesday. The keynote address Tuesday by CEO Jensen Huang failed to wow investors amid a tech-stock selldown, despite his announcement that the company will team up with GM (GM-0.05%) to build self-driving cars. Here’s a roundup from the speech. Tencent’s (TCEHY-0.79%) quarterly sales and profit both beat expectations and the Chinese internet giant announced increased investment in AI. The ADRs gained about 0.7%. Tesla (TSLA+3.88%) stock jumped 2.7% after it obtained a permit in California to operate a ride service and Cantor Fitzgerald — the firm formerly run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — upgraded the shares to a buy. Elon Musk’s EV maker fell 5.3% on Tuesday after BYD (BYDDY-6.16%) unveiled an ultra-fast charger, amid growing signs that Chinese EV makers are motoring ahead. BYD’s ADRs advanced 1.8%, following the Hong Kong-listed shares higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 18, 2025 23:39 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- Building on their longstanding partnership, NVIDIA, Alphabet and Google today announced new initiatives to advance AI, democratize access to AI tools, speed the development of physical AI and transform industries including healthcare, manufacturing and energy. Engineers and researchers throughout Alphabet are working closely with technical teams at NVIDIA to use AI and simulation to develop robots with grasping skills, reimagine drug discovery, optimize energy grids and more. Employing the NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and NVIDIA Isaac™ platforms, teams from Google DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, Intrinsic and X’s moonshot Tapestry will discuss milestones from their respective collaborations at the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference. To power research and AI production efforts for its customers, Alphabet’s Google Cloud will be among the first to adopt the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU, also announced today at GTC. NVIDIA will be the first industry partner to adopt SynthID, a Google DeepMind AI technology that embeds digital watermarks directly into AI-generated images, audio, text or video. “I’m proud of our ongoing and deep partnership with NVIDIA, which spans the early days of Android and our cutting-edge AI collaborations across Alphabet,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. “I’m really excited about the next phase of our partnership as we work together on agentic AI, robotics and bringing the benefits of AI to more people around the world.” “Alphabet and NVIDIA have a longstanding partnership that extends from building AI infrastructure and software to advancing the use of AI in the largest industries,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “It’s a great joy to see Google and NVIDIA researchers and engineers collaborate to solve incredible challenges, from drug discovery to robotics.” Developing Responsible AI and Open ModelsGoogle DeepMind and NVIDIA are working to build trust in generative AI through content transparency. NVIDIA will be the first external user of Google DeepMind’s SynthID, which embeds digital watermarks directly into AI-generated images, audio, text and video. SynthID helps preserve the integrity of outputs from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models, available on build.nvidia.com, helping to safeguard against misinformation and misattribution — all without compromising video quality. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA also partnered to optimize Gemma, Google’s family of lightweight, open models, to run on NVIDIA GPUs. The recent launch of Gemma 3 marks a significant leap forward for open innovation. NVIDIA has played a key role in making Gemma even more accessible for developers. Supercharged by the NVIDIA AI platform, Gemma is available as a highly optimized NVIDIA NIM™ microservice, harnessing the power of the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library for exceptional inference performance. In addition, this deep engineering collaboration will extend to optimizing Gemini-based workloads on NVIDIA accelerated computing via Vertex AI. The Age of Intelligent RobotsIntrinsic is an Alphabet company focused on making intelligently adaptive AI for robotics usable and valuable for manufacturers across industries.

Partnering with NVIDIA, the teams have built deeper and more intuitive developer workflows for Intrinsic Flowstate to support NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator foundation models for a universal robot grasping capability. Using foundation models for robotics will significantly reduce application development time and improve flexibility, with AI that can adapt effortlessly. At GTC, Intrinsic will also share an early OpenUSD framework streaming connection between Intrinsic Flowstate and NVIDIA Omniverse — enabling real-time visualization of robot workcells across platforms. Concurrently, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind are announcing a collaboration with Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine accelerated by the NVIDIA Warp framework that is compatible with MuJoCo. Powered by Newton, MuJoCo will accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x compared with MuJoCo’s existing GPU-accelerated simulator, MJX. Applying Innovation to Real-World ChallengesIsomorphic Labs, founded by Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, is reimagining drug discovery with AI. It has built a state-of-the-art drug design engine housed on Google Cloud with NVIDIA GPUs to enable the scale and performance needed to continue developing groundbreaking AI models that can help advance human health. Tapestry, X’s moonshot for the electric grid, is building AI-powered products for a greener and more reliable future grid. Tapestry and NVIDIA are exploring methods for increasing the speed and accuracy of electric grid simulations. This joint effort will focus on the challenges of integrating new energy sources and expanding grid capacity to meet the growing demands of data centers and AI, while helping ensure grid stability. The companies will evaluate potential solutions, including using AI to optimize the interconnection process, with the goal of enhancing the planning and modernization of energy infrastructure for a more sustainable future. The Next Generation of AI-Optimized InfrastructureBuilding on its commitment to provide customers with the most advanced AI infrastructure, Google Cloud will be one of the first companies to offer the latest instances of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs — NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition. Built on the groundbreaking Blackwell architecture introduced a year ago, Blackwell Ultra includes the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX™ B300 NVL16 system. The GB300 NVL72 delivers 1.5x more AI performance than the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, as well as increases Blackwell’s revenue opportunity by 50x for AI factories, compared with those built with NVIDIA Hopper™. NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell is the ultimate universal GPU for both AI and visual computing workloads across healthcare, manufacturing, retail, live broadcast and other industries. With last month’s preview launches of its A4 and A4X virtual machines, Google Cloud became the first cloud provider to offer both NVIDIA B200- and GB200-based instances. Now, A4 is generally available — with A4X coming soon — so customers can take advantage of Blackwell’s powerful performance with the added benefits of Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer. Google Cloud and NVIDIA have worked together to optimize popular open-source frameworks like JAX, a popular Python library for machine learning, and MaxText to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs at scale. MaxText, an advanced framework for scaling large models across massive GPU clusters, uses optimizations codeveloped with NVIDIA to enable efficient training on tens of thousands of GPUs.

At its annual developer conference GTC in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 18), Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled two upcoming GPU architectures: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. During his opening keynote, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the chipmaker’s ambitious vision to propel A.I. into an era of industrial-scale computing. Huang called GTC the “Super Bowl of A.I.”—with one key distinction: “At this Super Bowl, everyone wins,” he said. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Blackwell Ultra is expected to launch in the second half of 2025. Its successor, Rubin, is slated for late 2026, followed by the more advanced Rubin Ultra in 2027. Currently in production, Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra series is an advanced iteration of the Blackwell chips unveiled at last year’s GTC, which are 40 times more powerful than the previous-generation Hopper chips, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will incorporate eight stacks of 12-Hi HBM4E memory, providing 288GB of onboard memory. The architecture will feature NVLink 72, an upgraded high-speed interconnect technology designed to facilitate communication between GPUs and CPUs—crucial for processing the massive datasets required for A.I. training and inference. “NVLink connects multiple GPUs, turning them into a single GPU,” Huang explained. “It addresses the scale-up problem by enabling massive parallel computing.” In addition, the company unveiled the Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, engineered for enterprise workloads such as multimodal A.I. inference, immersive content creation and scientific computing. With 96GB of GDDR7 memory and support for multi-instance GPU technology, the RTX PRO 6000 is designed to power advanced A.I. development. Blackwell’s successor, Rubin, is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter in space. The initial version of the Rubin chip is expected to achieve 50 petaflops of speed during A.I. model execution. The more powerful Rubin Ultra can deliver up to 100 petaflops of performance, which Huang called a “major step forward” in A.I. processing and performance power. Early iterations of the Blackwell chips and racks reportedly faced overheating issues, leading some customers to reduce their orders. The newly introduced liquid-cooled Grace Blackwell 200 NVL72 system addresses these concerns, offering up to 30 times faster real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models and up to four times faster training compared to Nvidia’s previous-generation H100 GPU. It can generate up to 12,000 tokens per second—the basic units processed by A.I. models—dramatically accelerating both training and inference. “If you want your A.I. to be smarter, it must generate more tokens. That requires massive bandwidth, floating-point operations and memory,” said Huang. He also explained that reasoning A.I. models such as DeepSeek’s R1 model require 20 times more tokens and 105 times more computing power. Nvidia is also collaborating closely with Taiwan’s TSMC to develop data packaging technologies for data centers, a move that could substantially enhance computational efficiency and thermal demands in future GPU generations. Huang also outlined Nvidia’s roadmap beyond Rubin. “The next generation of architectures after Rubin will be named Feynman,” he said, confirming that Feynman HBM is already in development and slated for release in 2028. Named after Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, this upcoming architecture is expected to push A.I. performance to unprecedented levels. The announcements came on the heels of Nvidia’s better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results, driven by a surging demand for its GPUs. Despite increasing competition from rivals like AMD and geopolitical uncertainties including export restrictions on semiconductors, Nvidia currently dominates the global GPU market with an estimated 80 percent market share, according to a report by Nasdaq.

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang shared updates on the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips as part of his announcements at the company’s GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday. Huang also discussed the company’s work on reasoning models, agentic AI, photonics, and robotics at the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. Here are some takeaways from Huang’s keynote. Huang said Nvidia’s Blackwell chips — which he announced at last year’s GTC — are now in full production. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. Nvidia’s next-generation GPUs named after astronomer Vera Rubin will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said. Rubin has a new CPU that has twice the performance of its previous chip, as well as more memory and bandwidth. The second half of 2027 will bring Rubin Ultra, Huang said, which will contain multiple GPUs connected together. Huang said Nvidia’s next architecture will be named Feynman, and is coming in 2028. Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1 is the first open and fully customizable AI foundation model for building humanoid robots in the world, Huang said. The company will pre-train GR00T N1 on synthetic and real data, and release the open family of models to robotics developers. Huang unveiled Nvidia Dynamo — “essentially the operating system of an AI factory” — to accelerate and scale reasoning models efficiently. He also announced the Llama Nemotron family of reasoning models which will enable developers and enterprises to build AI agents. The new reasoning models are open. Huang introduced Nvidia DGX personal AI supercomputers, which are powered by the company’s Blackwell AI platform. DGX Station and DGX Spark, formerly known as Project DIGITS, will enable everyone from developers to students to prototype, fine-tune, and run AI models from a personal desktop.

General Motors (GM-0.05%) will rely on Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) artificial intelligence expertise to build its next generation of cars. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the partnership at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, California on Tuesday. “I’m super excited to announce that GM has selected Nvidia to partner with them to build their future self-driving car fleet,” Huang said. GM will use Nvidia’s Drive AGX platform, an in-vehicle computer that delivers “up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high performance computer,” and includes hardware and software to develop autonomous driving functions as well as immersive in-cabin experiences, according to the press release. The automotive giant will build its next-generation vehicles on the platform, which Nvidia says will speed the development and deployment of safe autonomous vehicles at scale. GM has already been investing in Nvidia graphics processing units for AI model training. As of Tuesday’s announcement, the two companies will expand their partnership to work together to build custom systems to train AI manufacturing models. That also includes optimizing GM’s automotive plant design and operations. To do so, GM will use the Nvidia Omniverse platform to create digital twins of their assembly lines, which will allow for virtual vehicle testing and production simulations. Nvidia will also help GM train robotics platforms already in use for operations, such as precision welding and material handling and transport. “AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a press release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.” GM became the first automaker to offer hands-free driving with the introduction of its Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system in 2017. While the hands-free cars are not completely self-driving cars since the driver might be required to take control if needed, they are a significant step in that direction. Still, the automaker has faced a bumpy road in the world of autonomous driving. In December, the company’s robotaxi service, Cruise, was forced to shut down operations. The decision came on the heels of an external probe into the company for misleading regulators about a 2023 incident in which one of the company’s robotaxis in San Francisco hit a pedestrian. Regardless, the company is optimistic about its path toward delivering safe autonomous vehicles for personal use. “The work we’re doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes,” GM said in the press release. “By further integrating physical and industrial AI applications (including digital twins, simulation, and robotics) we continue to optimize manufacturing, accelerate virtual testing, and ultimately build smarter, more connected vehicles for our customers.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 18, 2025 15:13 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC—NVIDIA today announced a major release of new NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models (WFMs), introducing an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI development and giving developers unprecedented control over world generation. NVIDIA is also launching two new blueprints — powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and Cosmos platforms — that provide developers with massive, controllable synthetic data generation engines for post-training robots and autonomous vehicles. Industry leaders including 1X, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, Foretellix, Skild AI and Uber are among the first to adopt Cosmos to generate richer training data for physical AI faster and at scale. “Just as large language models revolutionized generative and agentic AI, Cosmos world foundation models are a breakthrough for physical AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Cosmos introduces an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI and unlocks opportunities for step-function advances in robotics and the physical industries.” Cosmos Transfer for Synthetic Data GenerationCosmos Transfer WFMs ingest structured video inputs such as segmentation maps, depth maps, lidar scans, pose estimation maps and trajectory maps to generate controllable photoreal video outputs. Cosmos Transfer streamlines perception AI training, transforming 3D simulations or ground truth created in Omniverse into photorealistic videos for large-scale, controllable synthetic data generation. Agility Robotics will be an early adopter of Cosmos Transfer and Omniverse for large-scale synthetic data generation to train its robot models. “Cosmos offers us an opportunity to scale our photorealistic training data beyond what we can feasibly collect in the real world,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer of Agility Robotics. “We’re excited to see what new performance we can unlock with the platform, while making the most use of the physics-based simulation data we already have.” The NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for autonomous vehicle simulation uses Cosmos Transfer to amplify variations of physically based sensor data. With the blueprint, Foretellix can enhance behavioral scenarios by varying conditions like weather and lighting for diverse driving datasets. Parallel Domain is also using the blueprint to apply similar variation to its sensor simulation. The NVIDIA GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation combines Omniverse and Cosmos Transfer to generate diverse datasets at scale, benefiting from OpenUSD-powered simulations and reducing data collection and augmentation time from days to hours. Cosmos Predict for Intelligent World GenerationAnnounced at the CES trade show in January, Cosmos Predict WFMs generate virtual world states from multimodal inputs like text, images and video. New Cosmos Predict models will enable multi-frame generation, predicting intermediate actions or motion trajectories when given start and end input images. Purpose-built for post-training, these models can be customized using NVIDIA’s openly available physical AI dataset. With the inference compute power of NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 systems and their large NVIDIA NVLink™ domain, developers can achieve real-time world generation. 1X is using Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Transfer to train its new humanoid robot NEO Gamma. Robot brain developer Skild AI is tapping into Cosmos Transfer to augment synthetic datasets for its robots. Plus, Nexar and Oxa are using Cosmos Predict to advance their autonomous driving systems. Multimodal Reasoning for Physical AI Cosmos Reason is an open, fully customizable WFM with spatiotemporal awareness that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to understand video data and predict the outcomes of interactions — such as a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf — in natural language. Developers can use Cosmos Reason to improve physical AI data annotation and curation, enhance existing world foundation models or create new vision language action models. They can also post-train it to build high-level planners to tell the physical AI what it needs to do to complete a task. Accelerating Data Curation and Post-Training for Physical AIBased on their downstream task, developers can post-train Cosmos WFMs using native PyTorch scripts or the NVIDIA NeMo™ framework on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud. Cosmos developers can also use NVIDIA NeMo Curator on DGX Cloud for accelerated data processing and curation. Linker Vision and Milestone Systems are using it for curating large amounts of video data to train large vision language models for visual agents built on the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization. Virtual Incision is exploring it to be deployed in future surgical robots, while Uber and Waabi are advancing autonomous vehicles development. Driving Responsible AI and Content TransparencyIn line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, NVIDIA enforces open guardrails across all Cosmos WFMs. In addition, NVIDIA is collaborating with Google DeepMind to integrate SynthID to watermark and help identify AI-generated outputs from the Cosmos WFM NVIDIA NIM™ microservice featured on build.nvidia.com.

March 18, 2025 15:08 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a portfolio of technologies to supercharge humanoid robot development, including NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills. The other technologies include simulation frameworks and blueprints such as the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for generating synthetic data, as well as Newton, an open-source physics engine — under development with Google DeepMind and Disney Research — purpose-built for developing robots. Available now, GR00T N1 is the first of a family of fully customizable models that NVIDIA will pretrain and release to worldwide robotics developers — accelerating the transformation of industries challenged by global labor shortages estimated at more than 50 million people. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.” GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer CommunityThe GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2” is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making. Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements. System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform. GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as material handling, packaging and inspection. Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task. In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X Technologies. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.” Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics. NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research Focus on PhysicsNVIDIA announced a collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision. Built on the NVIDIA Warp framework, Newton will be optimized for robot learning and compatible with simulation frameworks such as Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo and NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab. Additionally, the three companies plan to enable Newton to use Disney’s physics engine. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are collaborating to develop MuJoCo-Warp, which is expected to accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x and will be available to developers through Google DeepMind’s MJX open-source library, as well as through Newton. Disney Research will be one of the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots, such as the expressive Star Wars-inspired BDX droids that joined Huang on stage during his GTC keynote. “The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” said Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before — and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” NVIDIA and Disney Research, along with Intrinsic, announced an additional collaboration to build OpenUSD pipelines and best practices for robotics data workflows. More Data to Advance Robotics Post-TrainingLarge, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day. Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation tasks from a small number of human demonstrations. Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11 hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%, compared with using only real data. To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on Hugging Face. AvailabilityNVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub. The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without extensive custom programming. The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.
