AMD's acquisition of Xilinx adds another dimension to its Stargate potential, as FPGAs offer the kind of flexible computing architecture that might be particularly valuable for handling the diverse workloads and communication protocols that interconnected AI systems would require. With a strong balance sheet, improving margins, and a clear technological roadmap focused on high-performance computing, AMD offers investors an alternative pathway to benefit from the computational demands Stargate will create while potentially outperforming the broader market if the company continues to execute its strategic initiatives. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources – precisely the capability essential for organizations seeking to implement Stargate's vision of interconnected AI. As the Stargate framework enables more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments will increase dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for Stargate deployments. The company's AIP offering already demonstrates Palantir's understanding of the need to connect proprietary data with external AI capabilities – a microcosm of what Stargate aims to achieve at a broader scale. This early positioning in the "AI orchestration" market suggests Palantir could emerge as a critical middleware layer in the Stargate ecosystem, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a somewhat higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will make Stargate's promise of interconnected AI a practical reality for enterprises and government agencies. Palantir Technologies saw its stock surge in early February 2025 after strong earnings, only to retreat sharply as concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts weighed on investor sentiment. The stock initially spiked to record highs but has since tumbled 30%, with accelerating selling momentum pushing it toward key support levels. Despite the pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are split—some see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, given Palantir’s role in federal data initiatives. At the same time, technical indicators suggest further downside risk if support near $85, $66, and $44 fails to hold. Investors should watch for a potential recovery toward $100 and $125 if momentum shifts. The Stargate AI Project represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence architecture that could dramatically accelerate AI capabilities by enabling previously isolated systems to work together seamlessly. The five companies profiled – NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, AMD and Palantir – each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to position themselves ahead of this technological evolution. From NVIDIA's dominance in AI hardware to Microsoft's enterprise software integration, Google's fundamental AI research leadership, AMD's competitive computing solutions and Palantir's expertise in complex systems integration, these firms provide complementary exposures to different aspects of the AI value chain that Stargate aims to revolutionize. While valuations remain elevated across the AI sector, these companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Tech giants that have dominated Wall Street for two years are losing their grip, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks shedding about $1.4 trillion in market value since December, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven index—tracking Apple Inc AAPL, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Microsoft Corp MSFT, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL)) GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META and Tesla Inc TSLA—has fallen roughly 10% from its December peak, officially entering correction territory. Don't Miss: Tesla has been the hardest hit, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet. Elon Musk‘s electric vehicle maker initially surged after President Donald Trump‘s November election victory but has since faced declining sales and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Meta stands as the lone bright spot, bucking the downward trend as investors endorse its AI strategy. The Facebook parent recorded a 19-day winning streak in February, adding more than $320 billion in market value. “The stock market has lost its leadership,” Jim Paulsen, an independent market strategist, told the Financial Times. Trending: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum It's a pivot from 2023 and 2024, when the seven companies posted enormous gains and drove the broader market higher. The Magnificent Seven had surged more than 160% between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, according to the FT, but the index has added just 1% so far this year. Investors are rotating into other sectors, with U.S. bank stocks attracting almost $2 billion in the week ended Feb. 3—the second-largest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Bank of America data cited by FT. Healthcare companies, European equities, gold, and smaller tech groups have also benefited from this repositioning. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Meanwhile, money is increasingly flowing toward privately held tech companies, with Anthropic, Coreweave, Databricks, OpenAI, Perplexity, ScaleAI and xAI—now dubbed the “Private Magnificent Seven,” seeing their cumulative valuation rise 40% between July and January, according to FT. Most market watchers view the broadening gains as healthy for what had become an expensive, top-heavy market. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Mislav Matejka caution that faster AI adoption and fewer barriers to entry could spell long-term trouble for the established tech giants. “Historically, it was never the incumbents which benefited from technological disruption, but the outsiders,” Matejka told FT.

Title: Markets wrap rough month driven by ‘Extreme Fear’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks seesawed Friday, but all three major indexes closed the month in the red — a sign of increasing unease in markets. Volatility gripped markets as traders closed out a dismal February that wiped out some gains. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday and for the fourth day in a row, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Stocks initially rose Friday morning, buoyed by cooling inflation data that provided relief for investors. Yet markets moved into the red midday following a very public heated exchange at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that stoked uncertainty around geopolitical stability. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, popped to its highest level this year. In afternoon trading, markets recouped losses, and the major indexes surged higher to close out the day. The Dow ended the day up 601 points, or 1.39%, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.63%. Yet US markets sputtered in February and slid this week. The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1% this week and is down 1.4% this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.5% this week and 4% this month, its worth month since April 2024. “We believe there is valid concern in the markets about the amount of money being spent on Artificial Intelligence datacenters and capex, considering news from China AI startup DeepSeek in late January,” said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a Friday note. Tentarelli said uncertainty about AI spending coupled with concerns about economic growth has led many of the stocks leading the Nasdaq to underperform. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward tech and was driven higher last year by companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Palantir (PLTR). Yet those surging tech stocks have slowed down this month. Tesla shares are down about 26% over the past month. The reasons for the Nasdaq’s decline range from inflation risk to decelerating growth to its stocks having tough outlooks compared to other assets, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, in an email. “Concerns about potential economic growth deceleration may be fostering increased risk aversion, potentially leading investors to shift away from the more volatile Nasdaq index in favor of more stable investment options,” said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. Nvidia posted strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, though its stock’s high valuation raises the question of how much more room there is to run. Still, the broader market remains near its all-time high, reached just last week. And the bumpiness in the market isn’t all that unusual for this time of year. “The stock market’s recent declines are simply garden variety volatility, largely because February is historically a volatile month, and because we saw significant gains throughout January,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. While new inflation data matched expectations, other economic data released Friday revealed cracks in the economy that contributed to weary investor sentiment: Consumer spending pulled back far more than economists expected in January and posted the biggest monthly decline since February 2021. “Investors will continue to focus on the uncertain growth trajectory as real spending unexpectedly fell in January from weaker consumer demand,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank’s estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 were also revised on Friday to project a decline of 1.5%, rather than growth of 2.3%. “This huge drop in the estimate reflects the very weak data that has been coming out on retail sales, net imports, inventories and new home sales,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said he is cautious about the market due to high valuations. At UBS, strategists advised preparing for volatility ahead, though considered the bull market intact. “We think the bull market is intact driven by healthy economic and profit growth, supportive Fed policy and AI spending/adoption,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Friday note. “But we have also cautioned that volatility would likely be higher this year due to policy uncertainty and trade frictions. Therefore, we have been highlighting that short-term hedges may be worth considering,” said Lefkowitz. CNN’s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Stocks were higher on Friday as President Trump’s latest announcement of new tariffs and China’s vow to retaliate heightened trade tensions. At around 12:40 PM in New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average popped by 0.2%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge tracking consumer spending on goods and services, was released in the morning, showing a 2.6% annual inflation rate for January—matching estimates and signaling steady inflation. Here are stocks to watch today: Dell (DELL-7.60%) shares declined on Friday after the tech company posted better-than-expected earnings but reported revenue of $23.9 billion, falling short of the projected $24.55 billion. Investors are also concerned about the profitability of the firm’s server business. Monster Beverage (MNST+0.84%) stock gained on Friday after the drink company’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ expectations, even as earnings per share fell short, Reuters reported. NetApp’s (NTAP-4.33%) shares fell in the afternoon as the company’s revenue missed consensus.

Tech stocks aren’t feeling the love from investors this earnings cycle, with even Nvidia (NVDA-9.60%) set for a weekly decline despite releasing an upbeat forecast and last-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Dell’s (DELL-7.60%) stock fell on Friday after its profit topped forecasts, but investors chose to focus on a revenue miss and the narrow profitability of its server business. Autodesk (ADSK-1.06%) slumped after rising yesterday on an earnings beat and newly disclosed plans to lay off employees. HP Inc. (HPQ-2.93%) and NetApp (NTAP-4.33%) also slid after earnings. Palantir (PLTR-2.28%) and Super Micro (SMCI-13.52%) extended declines. “While fourth-quarter earnings have been generally positive, with more companies than average beating expectations, some of the commentary about 2025 has been more negative,” Michael Rosen, CIO of Angeles Investments, told Quartz. Weaker consumer spending, tariffs, and possible policy changes are creating uncertainty. Nvidia did give a positive outlook, but investors in Big Tech stocks are still getting more cautious amid the general anxiety, Rosen added. They’ve had an incredible run over the past two years — justified by rising profits — but they’re now broadening their focus, as shown by gains in European equities. Mike Treacy, Head of Market Risk at Apex Fintech Solutions, sees a more-technical explanation for the weakness in tech stocks. “We are seeing a massive unwind across multiple risk assets: AI, momentum stocks, crypto, etc.,” he told Quartz. “We are below the 200-day moving average in both SMH and NVDA. Despite robust earnings from NVDA, we could see technical selling across the AI ecosystem until these charts recover.” The days a single earnings report could cause a jump in Nvidia’s stock are probably over because the company has become so big in market value, said Explosive Options’ founder Bob Lang. “There was nothing wrong with the earnings,” Lang said in an interview. “It’s just become a megacap company, like Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) before that and IBM (IBM-1.56%) even earlier. It’s unlikely to be better than a market performer, not a stock that fund managers can rely on to make a quarter.” It wasn’t all down-arrow on Friday: Nvidia is trading up on the day.

Despite delivering another record quarter, Nvidia (NVDA-9.60%) fell out of the $3 trillion market cap club after some unimpressed investors were left wanting more. Nvidia’s stock was up by around 1.4% during morning trading on Friday at around $121 per share, leaving the firm with a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap. Still, the chipmaker’s shares fell in early trading on Thursday after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.47%), Intel (INTC-4.83%), and other chip rivals also saw declining shares. “What seems to be driving the share reaction is that it’s yet another typical Nvidia report where they beat and raise expectations,” Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. “For them to have this track record of doing that every time, in some way almost works against them as the market is not impressed unless it is a blowout beat and raise.” The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Its full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is $3 Trillion Nvidia (NVDA) A Value Stock?

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia’s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald’s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company’s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, “The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we’re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute." For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia’s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels—etch and deposition tools—needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia’s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam’s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.

After it delivered another record quarter, all eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA-9.60%) announcements at its annual GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell artificial intelligence platform at last year’s conference — known as the GTC — which has now “successfully ramped up” large-scale production and is “achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Demand for the chips, which faced production delays due to design flaws and overheating issues, is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models, according to Huang. On the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call, Huang said he will discuss the company’s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, its next-generation AI platform, Vera Rubin, and its plans for following products at the conference. During the company’s earnings call in May, Huang announced that Nvidia already had another chip coming after Blackwell, and that the company is “on a one-year rhythm.” The following month, Huang announced Blackwell Ultra and the Rubin platform during an appearance at COMPUTEX in Taiwan. During the call with analysts on Wednesday, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The upcoming developers conference will be “another positive catalyst to help solidify the performance advantages of Blackwell and lay a framework for continued AI spending, particularly on the inference side,” Jefferies (JEF-3.61%) analysts said in a note on Thursday. Despite surpassing revenue and guidance expectations, Nvidia’s shares fell on Thursday as some investors were left unimpressed by its results. However, Nvidia is expected to “get the market excited about everything in the product pipeline,” at the GTC next month, John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, shared similar sentiments, saying Nvidia’s “real story is its rapid cadence of innovation,” in comments shared with Quartz. “With GTC around the corner, I expect further product announcements to build on today’s momentum.” The GTC takes place between March 17 and 21, and Huang will deliver his keynote address on March 18.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Predicts the Next Big Thing After ‘Agentic A.I’

A.I. agents may be all the rage right now, but Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is already looking beyond the hype. A.I.’s next phase will be “physical A.I.,” he said during Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call yesterday (Feb. 26). Physical A.I. is a form of A.I. systems that can interact directly with the real world and encompasses products like autonomous vehicles and robots. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Now is the beginning of the agentic A.I. era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it. Then, there’s physical A.I. after that,” Huang told analysts. He went on to explain, “They can’t just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence and cause and effect.” To this effect, Nvidia in January unveiled a platform of “world models,” which attempt to simulate real-world environments. Known as Cosmos, the new platform promises to advance the training of physical A.I. systems by providing highly realistic virtual worlds. Self-driving cars, for example, could be tested across various simulated weather conditions, while robotics companies could examine the safety of their products in different scenarios. Cosmos has already been adopted by robotics companies like 1X and Neura Robotics and autonomous vehicle makers like Waabi and Wayve. The platform is also working with Uber (UBER) as it explores robotaxi products, Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress said yesterday. “Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language A.I., Cosmos is a physical A.I. to revolutionize robotics,” she added. “World models” is a concept picking up steam in A.I. Last year, Fei-Fei Li, a renowned computer scientist and leading figure in A.I. research, founded World Labs, which looks to infuse A.I. with “spatial intelligence” that understands and interacts with the real world. The startup raised $230 million last year and unveiled an early glimpse of its progress in generating virtual 3D scenes from 2D images. For the time being, A.I. developers are heavily focusing on agents, with leaders like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) emphasizing autonomous, action-taking features in recent A.I. releases. Nvidia is doing just fine in the agentic A.I. era. The company’s quarterly revenue surged 78 percent year-over-year to $39.3 billion, the vast majority of which came from its data center business. Profit during the quarter jumped 80 percent to $22 billion. Nvidia’s physical A.I. dreams remain a minuscule part of its business, with its automotive and robotics division accounting for less than 2 percent of the company’s total revenue during the November-January quarter. This share will rise in the future. “Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars,” Huang told analysts, adding that Nvidia will “be improving them using an A.I. factory” powered by physical A.I. Despite exceeding Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and net income, some investors were spooked by Nvidia’s underwhelming gross margin outlook. Nvidia’s stock is down by more than 3 percent today. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Nvidia (NVDA-9.60%) finished the fiscal year by delivering record revenue and outlook above expectations for the fourth quarter — and more than doubling its full-year revenue from the previous year. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s full-year revenue grew 114% year over year to a record $130.5 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, adding that demand for the new chips is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. According to Nvidia’s 10-K filing, just three anonymous customers made up more than 30% of total revenue for the fiscal year ended in January. “Direct Customer A” accounted for 12% of total revenue, while Direct Customers B and C each represented 11%, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Direct Customer B made up 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, the filing said. All of the sales “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” according to the filing. For the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia had reported revenue of $35.1 billion — 36% of which came from three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, according to the company’s Form 10-Q. The filing also showed that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. Although the chipmaker will not disclose the companies, its top customers could likely include Alphabet (GOOGL-2.28%), Amazon (AMZN-4.15%), Meta (META-2.42%), Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%), and Tesla (TSLA-4.43%).

Nvidia (NVDA-9.60%) delivered another record quarter and raised outlook on strong demand for its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, confirming that Big Tech’s big spending on AI will continue, analysts said. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Fiscal first quarter guidance was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “It was logical to be concerned about the ramping of Blackwell, but we have now successfully ramped Blackwell,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a post-earnings appearance on CNBC (CMCSA-0.18%). Huang added that he believes Nvidia is “successfully behind the air pocket” in demand over which investors raised concerns as customers transitioned from Hopper to Blackwell. “We’re going to have a good quarter next quarter. And we’ve got a fairly good pipeline of demand for Blackwell,” Huang said. Jefferies (JEF-3.61%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that “[t]he supply chain should continue to improve,” and that they “see no signs of demand issues,” for Blackwell. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “The recent setback in Nvidia’s stock from DeepSeek and the narrative that AI demand would decline proved unfounded as customers continue to race to scale AI infrastructure, largely with Nvidia chips,” Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, also said he doesn’t think DeepSeek will “clobber demand for Nvidia’s data centre chips” in comments shared with Quartz. The chipmaker’s expectations for the current fiscal year “look to be about right which combined with the good visibility that I think the company has means that there will be few surprises this year,” Windsor said. Meanwhile, concerns by investors over Nvidia’s top customers designing their own custom chips “appear overdone,” Sun said. “Nvidia’s ecosystem advantages and software stack remain formidable barriers to entry.” On its post-earnings call, Nvidia said the reasoning AI models over which firms such as OpenAI and Google are competing “can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.” The company “is uniquely positioned to capture this exponential growth,” Sun said.

Nvidia (NVDA-9.60%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.47%), Micron (MU-4.19%), Broadcom (AVGO-6.94%), and Intel (INTC-4.83%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-4.71%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia, the chipmaker that fueled 22% of the S&P 500’s total returns in 2024 with a 171.25% stock surge, continues to ride the AI wave into 2025. Its latest quarterly earnings, released after market close Wednesday, showcase a company still firing on all cylinders—yet the market’s response hints at a maturing narrative. With the stock down 2.24% year-to-date entering earnings, investors are wrestling with whether Nvidia’s meteoric rise can sustain its momentum amid economic uncertainty and shifting tech priorities. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, covering the period ending January 26, 2025, smashed expectations. The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, a 78% leap from $22.1 billion a year ago and a 12% increase from the prior quarter’s $35.1 billion, according to a press release issued by Nvidia. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.89, up 82% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share matched at $0.89, a 71% annual gain. The data center segment, Nvidia’s AI powerhouse, soared to $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year, driven by booming demand for its Blackwell and Hopper GPU platforms. CEO Jensen Huang touted the results on the Q4 earnings call, saying, “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law—increasing compute makes models smarter.” The Blackwell platform, ramping up to “massive-scale production,” contributed billions in sales this quarter alone, per Huang’s remarks. Since November 2024, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have traded sideways, with all three posting negative year-to-date returns. The S&P 500, tethered to these giants, has stalled alongside them as the U.S. economy faces turbulence with incoming policy shifts—tariffs, tax changes, and deregulation—under a new administration. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT 12-Month Returns The two-year rally in Big Tech, propelled by artificial intelligence hype, could be hitting a ceiling as firms pivot from raw compute power to efficiency. Innovations like DeepSeek’s compute-light AI models suggest a future where Nvidia’s dominance might face pressure. Competitors such as AMD and Intel are developing alternatives to Nvidia’s AI offerings. AMD’s Instinct MI300 series has secured adoption in cloud computing environments. However, Nvidia’s ecosystem, supported by its CUDA software platform and established partnerships with major hyperscalers, continues to hold a leading position in the AI chip market. Optimists eyeing AI’s secular growth might see Nvidia’s dip as a buy signal, but broader exposure could be wiser. The Nasdaq and S&P 500—down 3.1% and 1.8% year-to-date, respectively, per today’s close, are laden with AI-adjacent firms, offering upside with less single-stock risk. Nvidia’s Q4 2024 earnings cement its AI supremacy—$130.5 billion in fiscal-year revenue, up 114%, speaks for itself. But as the market digests its maturity and braces for economic twists, the era of unchecked gains may be cooling. Investors should weigh diversification and patience in this volatile new chapter.
