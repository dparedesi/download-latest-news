Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/02/24/week-ahead-busy-week-on-wall-street/

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Bybit Hack Fails to Ruffle Feathers, Traders Eye SOL ETF

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

(Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia, the $3 Trillion AI posterchild, is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, February 26. The company will likely continue to report robust demand for its products and a compelling outlook. The stock is likely to pop - per our data on how Nvidia reacts post earnings. However, there is a larger risk to the US economy, worth factoring right now. What is that? See more on Trefis.com Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia. When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table. NVDA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 3 economic downturns. Inflation Shock (Jan 2022 to May 2023) • NVDA stock fell 66% from a high of $33 on 19 November 2021 to $11 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-inflation shock peak by 25 May 2023 - taking 154 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 317 days • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and currently trades at around $135. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. • NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days. • During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.70%) is expected to release its fiscal fourth quarter earnings results at the end of the trading day on Wednesday. The chipmaker’s stock was down 4% to $134.40 per share at Friday’s market close. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.38%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion for the quarter ended in January, while analysts are expecting earnings of $0.85 per share. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-1.06%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF-0.72%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

Title: NVIDIA To Surge 20% With Earnings?

CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, an Nvidia logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia.

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek

Nvidia (NVDA-1.26%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-1.05%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-1.11%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.

For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that’s beyond solid, liquid and gas. “Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. While traditional computing currently relies on bits, quantum computing utilizes qubits—a unit of information that can operate in multiple states simultaneously, instead of being either on or off. To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a “topological state,” a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are “faster, more reliable and smaller,” providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella. Researchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry’s race to develop quantum computers—a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change. A one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic. “Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,” Microsoft said. Microsoft isn’t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years—a number that surpasses the age of the universe—to complete. But not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology’s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that “very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.” Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “My understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Nadella is more optimistic. Microsoft’s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. “And then it’s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,” he said. While it’s under Nadella’s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s—long before Nadella joined the company. “It’s unbelievable,” Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I’m the third CEO of Microsoft who’s been excited about quantum.” Despite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft’s research division, according to Nadella. “We’ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,” he said. “Maybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Nvidia's new AI tool can teach sign language

Nvidia (NVDA-1.70%) is launching an artificial intelligence-powered platform for learners of American Sign Language — the third-most prevalently used language in the U.S. Together with the American Society for Deaf Children and creative agency Hello Monday, Nvidia developed an interactive web platform called Signs to support ASL learning. The platform will also provide a dataset validated by fluent ASL users and interpreters that developers can use to build more accessible AI applications. Signs features a library of ASL signs for learners to improve their vocabulary, as well as a 3D avatar teacher. Learners can get real-time feedback on their signing via an AI tool that analyzes webcam footage. The platform initially has 100 signs, and is focused on hand movements and finger positions. Users can also learn the meanings of different facial expressions and head movements. Nvidia said it wants to grow the signs library to 400,000 video clips for 1,000 signed words. Signs users can contribute to the video dataset, which is open-source. The company added that it plans to make the dataset available to the public for building accessible AI agents, video conferencing features, and other AI tools. “Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Giving family members accessible tools like Signs to start learning ASL early enables them to open an effective communication channel with children as young as six to eight months old,” Cheri Dowling, executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children, said in a statement. “And knowing that professional ASL teachers have validated all the vocabulary on the platform, users can be confident in what they’re learning.” The company is currently working with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research to improve the platform, and is looking to include regional and slang terms in the Signs library. The dataset will be released sometime this year, Nvidia said, and the ASL learning service is live now. Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing for its annual GPU Technology Conference in March, where attendees can also use Signs. The company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week.

Title: Here Is What Wall Street Analysts Are Forecasting About NVIDIA’s GB200, B200, And NVL Rack Server Shipments Ahead Of The Earnings Next Week

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software."
