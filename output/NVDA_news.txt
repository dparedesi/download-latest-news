Here's a juicy bit of tech history: Back in 2013, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) legendary founder Morris Chang asked Nvidia's (NVDA) Jensen Huang to take over as CEO. It wasn't just a casual pitch. Chang laid out a 10-minute vision for Taiwan Semiconductor's future, convinced Huang's industry smarts and leadership chops made him the perfect successor. But Huang? He shut it down, quick, with a polite, I already have a job. That job, of course, was running Nvidia. And oh, how that decision paid off. Nvidia exploded into the AI juggernaut it is today, while Taiwan Semiconductor thrived under new leadership, cementing itself as the chipmaking kingpin for giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with TSM. This moment is more than just a fun anecdoteit's a masterclass in leadership and strategy. Huang's decision to stick with Nvidia wasn't just loyalty; it was foresight. By doubling down on Nvidia's potential, he steered the company to a $1 trillion market cap, driven by insatiable AI demand. Meanwhile, Chang's knack for partnerships and market positioning turned Taiwan Semiconductor into the semiconductor backbone of the digital economy. It's no coincidence these two companies remain tethered, with Taiwan Semiconductor producing Nvidia's cutting-edge chips. Their trajectories highlight the power of staying the course and playing to your strengthsa lesson Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now trying to catch up on as it chases the foundry crown. For investors, this is a clear signal: Leadership decisions aren't just boardroom dramathey're market movers. Chang and Huang's mutual respect and strategic brilliance laid the groundwork for today's AI and semiconductor boom. Nvidia's rise in AI and Taiwan Semiconductor's dominance in chipmaking didn't happen by luckit happened because of visionary calls like these. The takeaway? Bet on the leaders who see not just the game ahead but the game-changing partnerships that will take them there. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Over the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.

Title: Nvidia's stock is down over 10% as Trump talks up tariffs

Time Published: 2024-11-27T19:00:00Z

While Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.15%) shares have tripled in value so far this year, its shares dropped more than 10% in the week after it reported fiscal third-quarter earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down by about 2.3% during Wednesday afternoon trading and was down by almost 10.4% over the past five days. After the company reported record fiscal third-quarter earnings last week, Nvidia’s shares fell by almost 3.5% in after-hours trading. The decline continued the following morning, with the stock dropping around 1%. Despite beating revenue estimates for another straight quarter, Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — only slightly above what analysts were expecting. The stock slide deepened Monday, when Nvidia’s shares dropped by more than 4% after Reuters (TRI+0.55%) reported that the company’s executive vice president of Worldwide Field Operations Jay Puri had met with Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen in Beijing. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on Chinese imports by 60% or more when he takes office in January, recently adding that he would impose an additional 10% tariff “on all of their many products coming into the United States of America” until China stops the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US. These proposed tariffs could spark retaliatory measures from Beijing, with Chinese state media warning Tuesday that “there are no winners in tariff wars.” China remains a crucial market for Nvidia, accounting for about 17% of the company’s revenue in the year ending January 2024, down from 26% two years earlier due to existing US export restrictions. The company’s latest China-specific chip, the H20, is projected to generate over $12 billion in sales this year, according to research group SemiAnalysis. Meanwhile, the outgoing Biden administration is expected to announce new export controls on China as early as next week, Reuters reported, that could target hundreds of Chinese chip companies. The U.S. has already imposed several trade restrictions to prevent U.S. firms, including Nvidia, from exporting U.S.-made technology to China.

Title: Elon Musk's demands for Nvidia's AI chips strained its supply
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-nvidia-ai-chips-strain-supply-xai-colossus-1851709302
Time Published: 2024-11-27T16:23:00Z

Tesla (TSLA+3.69%) CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of artificial intelligence chips for his supercomputer has pushed Nvidia (NVDA+2.15%) to its production limits. In an email to colleagues, a sales lead at the chipmaker said the billionaire’s demand for its chips was straining its supply chain, the Wall Street Journal (NWS+1.17%) reported, citing the email it viewed. “We’ve worked hard to meet the needs of all customers and have greatly expanded the available supply today,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. In September, Musk announced that his AI startup, xAI, had brought its Colossus training cluster online after only 122 days. Colossus, which he called “the most powerful AI training system in the world,” is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 training chips. Musk said the cluster “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 units. While AI rivals including OpenAI and Meta (META+0.90%) also have hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s chips, Colossus has the most processors of an individual AI computing cluster in the world. During an Oracle (ORCL+1.17%) investor event in September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he and Musk spent a dinner “begging” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang for more of Nvidia’s AI chips. “Please take our money. No, no take more of it. We need you to take more of our money. Please,” Ellison said about the conversation. “It went okay. It worked.” xAI’s supercomputer will be used to train the next generation of xAI’s large language model (LLM), Grok, which is meant to rival OpenAI’s GPT-4. In May, the AI startup raised $6 billion from heavyweight investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. The Series B funding round pushed xAI to a $24 billion valuation. Earlier this month, it was reported that xAI is set to raise another $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq slide after key Fed inflation gauge shows faltering progress

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks dipped Wednesday as investors digested fresh data that showed inflation made little progress toward the Fed's 2% target in October. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off about 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down roughly 0.6%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by the debate over the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans and Cabinet choices. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the top US trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down more than 11%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While a holiday-shortened market day on Friday still separates investors from a fresh month of trading, December is nearly here. And Carson group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 of 10 times. In more recent history, since 2000, the index has risen in every December after the strong rally to start the year. The rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency returned on Wednesday afternoon. After surging near $100,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC-USD) had been quieter this week. But late Wednesday, bitcoin quickly moved higher from a low of $91,804 to a high of $97,357. While traditional markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, bitcoin's $100,000 watch will roll on. Mortgage rates edged lower as financial markets reacted to President-elect Donald Trump’s slate of Cabinet picks. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: President-elect Donald Trump has been quick to promise new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. Read more here. Recent inflation prints have shown little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, showed prices rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with the reading from the September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% seen the year prior. And as our chart below shows, the short-term trend hasn't painted a better picture either. Over the past three months, core PCE has risen at annualized rate of 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% goal. While key inflation readings from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for November loom before the Fed meets again in mid-December, the current inflation data has some economists questioning if the central bank will pause interest rate cuts soon. "Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months," Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. "If you think the Fed is on a declining rate path, which we do, that's probably leaning toward the pause [cutting interest rates] camp." Gruenwald added that the Fed won't be in a hurry to cut rates unless it sees a "more convincing decline" in core PCE. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 3% on Wednesday, weighing on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Shares in the AI chip giant are off about 9% in the past five days as investors have digested the company's latest quarterly earnings release. Other tech stocks were lower on Wednesday, including Dell (DELL). The company's stock fell more than 10% following its quarterly earnings release. In a call with analysts, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said AI spending "will not be linear." Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. "We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment," Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. "In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there." Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. "A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market," Bank of America's Bhave said. "For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims." "So while the labor market has moderated," Bhave said, "It hasn’t rolled over!" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth "will not be linear." "AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down," Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. "That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing." Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Read more about Dell's most recent earnings results and its role in the AI market here. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. Read more here. Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued "US exceptionalism," continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the "global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity." He added, "heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment." US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%. Economic data: Personal income & spending (October); MBA mortgage applications (Nov. 22); GDP annualized (third quarter second estimate); Wholesale inventories (October); Initial jobless claims, (week ending Nov. 23); Pending home sales Earnings: No notable earnings releases.

But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this." Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined.

(Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report. The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout. The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche, with 9 buys and real-time alerts from 2021 to 2022 below $20.
