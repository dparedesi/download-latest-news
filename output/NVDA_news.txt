Title: One Big Beautiful Bill & Job Growth Send Stocks To New Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Continued job growth and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the One Beautiful Big Bill ... More Act (OBBBA) helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms as the next big hurdle this week. Better-than-expected job growth and the passage of US tax legislation propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Friday. Please note that the tax bill is named the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA), so no partisan political views are intended by using its name. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The resiliency of the labor market and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the OBBBA helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since the stocks bottomed, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. This data bolsters confidence in the view that the macroeconomic situation has been the primary driver of stocks so far this year. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks The S&P 500 reached an all-time high in the holiday-shortened week, now resting at 2.2% above its previous mid-February high after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 3.5% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. The strength in US bank stocks remains notable. The Federal Reserve recently revised its methodology, which will result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital means better profitability and the ability to return more capital to shareholders. In addition, banks are economically sensitive, so they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. Market Returns Employment grew by 147,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly higher, which is a positive. The household survey data was solid, with a gain of 93,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 751,000. The significant increase in the research series reverses much of the decline from the previous month. Monthly Job Growth Contrary to expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. The decline was due to job gains of 93,000 in the household survey and a reduction of 130,000 in the labor force. US Unemployment Rate Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.8% last month. The average workweek hours were lower at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, hampered by weather and the LA fires. Workweek & Wages Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The improvement in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market has been resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Bottom line: The details of the jobs report were less impressive than the headline, but job growth was better than expected, and labor market health remains solid. Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. The better jobs data eliminated any chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is still expected in September. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Economic data releases are sparse this week. In addition, there are only two companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings. Now that the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA) has been signed into law, President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline should be the focus. While deals with Vietnam and the UK, as well as a détente with China, have been reached, the tariff levels of many large trading partners remain unsettled, barring a trade agreement. President Trump said letters are being sent to the countries notifying them of the effective tariff rate on their exports to the US, effective August 1, unless a trade deal is reached. Market participants will be keen to see if more trade deals are signed or if the possible economic drag from higher tariffs begins to weigh on the US economic outlook again. Stocks have reacted favorably to the better economic data and the likely boost from the tax cuts passed last week. The hurdles at these valuation levels are higher, but optimism about future corporate earnings has improved as economic downside risks have receded. Another spike in effective tariff rates around President Trump’s July 9 deadline could raise concerns about the economic headwinds increasing again, so increased volatility would not be unexpected.

Title: Are Deals Back? IPOs, M&A Recover After 'Liberation Day' Blip
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/are-deals-back-ipos-m-and-a-recover-after-liberation-day-blip-11764018

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.

Nvidia (NVDA) could be poised to claim the title of most valuable company in history, as its market value nears $4 trillion. The AI chipmaker's shares rose just over 1% to close at an all-time high of $159.34 Thursday, pushing its market capitalization to $3.89 trillion. If the stock had sustained its intraday highs closer to $161, its market value would have topped Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion in December. With another roughly 3% rise from Thursday's closing price to $163.93, Nvidia could also hit the $4 trillion market cap threshold soon, something no other company has done. Microsoft (MSFT), which has jockeyed with Nvidia this year for the title of world's most valuable company, could too, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives. “We believe both Nvidia and Microsoft will hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club....as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI Revolution," the analysts said in a note to clients Thursday. Thursday's rise came amid broader market gains, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting all-time highs ahead of a long holiday weekend. The stock market closed early at 1 p.m. ET Thursday ahead of the July 4 holiday on Friday.

Title: How Lam Research Stock Gets To $200
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/03/how-lam-research-stock-gets-to-200/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Lam Research Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent supplier of equipment for chip fabrication, is poised to gain from the increasing capital expenditures driven by the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence industry. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) grabs attention with its stock price soaring more than 3 times over the last two years and its valuation approaching $4 trillion, less known companies like Lam play an essential role in the manufacturing of the AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks may provide a more stable value with significant potential for upside. The data is persuasive. According to SEMI, capital expenditure on advanced chip-making equipment is expected to nearly double from 2023 to 2028, and global capex spending is anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Lam, which focuses on deposition and etching equipment—two of the foremost processes in chip production—may be well-positioned to seize a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s primary clients include industry titans like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, establishing it as a key player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Although traditionally dominant in memory chips, Lam is broadening its footprint in advanced logic chips and packaging technologies—fields that are witnessing increasing demand as chip design complexity escalates. AI tasks require not just advanced processing power but also high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and intricate stacking architectures. For instance, the fabrication of HBM chips is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM because of lower bit density and the requirement for 3D stacking. This results in a direct increase in demand for tools manufactured by companies like Lam. Whereas chip designers such as Nvidia have experienced skyrocketing valuations, Lam's stock has lagged. Shares have decreased by approximately 9% over the past 12 months and presently trade at around 24 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 35 times. Indeed, the valuation disparity is partly attributable to Lam’s reliance on China, which represented 31% of revenues in the March quarter. Ongoing U.S. export restrictions have impacted this segment, likely restricting Lam's capacity to capitalize on the substantial Chinese market. According to consensus estimates, Lam's revenues are projected to grow by around 22% in FY25, although growth is expected to cool to roughly 2% in FY’26, in part due to these China-related challenges, with earnings also expected to remain flat. Nonetheless, if heightened demand related to AI, combined with a possible relaxation of chip equipment export restrictions to China, leads to sustained revenue growth at FY’25 rates of about 22% annually over the next three years, Lam's revenue could increase by around 1.8 times. Even if profit margins stay near current levels of 27% (as recorded over the first nine months of FY25), and if the valuation multiple rises to about 30 times (up from 24 times currently, a 1.25 times growth), the stock could potentially double from the current price of approximately $97 to over $200 per share. Several scenarios could lead to this outcome. Last week, the U.S. and China established a trade framework that encompasses rare earth exports and a potential relaxation of technology restrictions. If this easing of tensions applies to chip equipment exports, companies like Lam might gain renewed access to a vital growth market, further enhancing revenues. Furthermore, the process of chip manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive, meaning that a larger portion of the chip's expense is now equipment-related—a distinct advantage for companies like Lam. Additionally, advanced packaging methods, such as stacking and connecting multiple chips, which are already being used for AI tasks, should boost the demand for Lam’s high-end machinery. Certainly, Lam faces significant risks. Beyond the China issue, the memory chip arena, where Lam has historically excelled, is encountering pricing pressures. Flash memory prices have been declining due to decreased demand from consumer markets and capex in this sector has been subdued as key players reduce production. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and U.S. tariffs could further obscure Lam’s short-term growth prospects. Although Lam is a highly specialized company with robust intellectual property, it may not enjoy the same protective barrier as a firm like ASML, which essentially has a monopoly over its trade of extreme ultraviolet lithography. On the other hand, Lam faces numerous competitors, such as Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron, which also provide similar services. That said, the long-term upcycle appears to be secure. The global semiconductor market is forecasted to surpass $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, rising from approximately $624 billion in 2024 according to the Wall Street Journal. As chip manufacturers adopt next-generation technologies to enable AI, the demand for sophisticated manufacturing tools is likely to remain high, directly benefiting Lam. While investing in a single stock like LRCX entails risk, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptive means to maximize the advantages of favorable market conditions while curbing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Shares of Cyngn (CYN) took off Wednesday when the maker of self-driving industrial vehicles announced it raised enough cash in a shelf offering to cover its expenses through 2027. CEO Lior Tal wrote in a letter to shareholders that the company brought in $32 million last week. That's also when Cyngn made headlines by striking a collaboration agreement with Nvidia (NVDA). Tal added that the firm's DriveMod autonomous vehicles are "now operating in warehouse aisles and across factory floors around the clock, delivering measurable improvements to safety, productivity, and labor costs." Tal said that Cyngn machines have been deployed at several new sites across industries in recent months, including manufacturing, automotive, logistics, and consumer-packaged goods. Tal explained that to keep up with demand, Cyngn has moved into a new, larger headquarters office in Mountain View, Calif. Tal noted that the deal with Nvidia to use the chipmaker's Isaac robotics platform "has helped us move faster." Despite today's 12% advance, Cyngn shares are down nearly 90% in 2025. TradingView

July 02, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The drone surveying market is expected to continue to sustain and continue to gain momentum due to increasing demand for aerial intelligence and high-precision mapping across major sectors such as agriculture, mining, construction, and environmental monitoring. A report from Fact.MR analysis indicates that the industry will be valued at USD 1.97 billion in 2025 and will grow to USD 11.49 billion by 2035, at a strong CAGR of 19.3% during the period. The report said: “Technological improvements in LiDAR, thermal imaging, and real-time stream of data over the past three years have dramatically improved safety and efficiency in drone surveying. Drones are increasingly being employed by governments and institutions for commercial use as they are safe, accurate, and cost-effective. Fact.MR believes that support from the authorities, especially in Europe and North America, is fueling commercial usage with better codes in the law. The increasing demand for high-precision geospatial intelligence is one of the key drivers of the adoption of drone surveying. Fact.MR research is of the view that the mining, agriculture, oil & gas, and infrastructure sectors increasingly depend on drones to maximize planning, minimize human risk, and digitize high-resolution terrain information with cost-efficient scalability across vast and inaccessible areas. The enormous digital revolution in the industrial sectors continues to accelerate demand. Combining drones with AI analytics, GIS platforms, and cloud systems enables real-time processing and decision-making. Fact. MR believes that the combination of drone technology with automation and IoT is revolutionizing conventional surveying processes into dynamic data-driven ecosystems.” Active Companies in the markets today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), Trimble Inc. (NASDAQ: TRMB), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Fact.MR continued: “The drone surveying industry is segmented by survey type into land survey, property survey, rail survey, and infrastructure survey. By end-use industry, it is categorized into energy, construction, transportation & warehouse, agriculture, mining, oil & gas extraction, public administration, and real estate & industrial plant. Regionally, the industry spans North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. IT concluded: “During the period 2025 to 2035, the infrastructure survey will be the most remunerative survey type segment, driven by the worldwide boom in urbanization, smart city programs, and projects for modernizing public infrastructure. Due to this increasing dependence and favorable regulatory changes across UAV use in civil infrastructure, the infrastructure survey segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.6% from 2025 to 2035, ahead of the industry average of 19.3%.” ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Expands Drone as a Service (DaaS) to California with Offer to Acquire an Engineering and Surveying Firm, Tapping into Precision Agriculture and Viticulture Market - ZenaTech, Inc. (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), and enterprise SaaS, has signed an offer to acquire a California-based civil engineering and land surveying firm with a well established history of operations. This marks ZenaTech’s first proposed transaction in the US West Coast or Southwest region, creating a strategic entry point into California ─ a high-value market for drone-based precision agriculture due to a massive agriculture economy, crop diversity, labor and water challenges, and an openness to innovation. With a commercial, construction and sustainability solution customer base and a deep regional presence, the proposed acquisition positions ZenaTech to scale its Drone as a Service or DaaS survey operations. It also provides significant opportunity to expand into California’s wine and agriculture sectors using advanced drone capabilities including aerial imaging, precision spraying, irrigation analytics, and wildfire detection and monitoring in high-risk areas. “This proposed acquisition is more than just our first Southwest region location — it’s a strategic foothold into a high-value, high-growth state for precision agriculture,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO of ZenaTech. “The firm is a natural fit to help execute our growth strategy for crop health monitoring and precision spraying to serve viticulture, large estates, and commercial farming operations across California.” With the global agricultural drone market projected to reach USD 10.3 billion by 2030, driven by rising demand for precision technologies in farming, California stands out as a key growth region as well as being home to nearly 90% of all US vineyard acreage. Considering California’s mounting climate and agricultural challenges, ZenaTech’s AI-powered autonomous drone solutions offer timely, scalable innovation that serves the needs of commercial enterprises, cooperatives, agriculture consultants, and public sector stakeholders. ZenaTech’s Drone as a Service (DaaS) business model offers both business and government customers reduced costs and convenience to utilize drones to streamline legacy processes and manual tasks such as inspections, surveying, maintenance, precision agriculture and inventory management ─ there is no need to purchase drone hardware and software, find a drone pilot, manage maintenance and operation, or acquire regulatory approvals. The model also offers scalability to use more often or less often based on business needs and utilizes ZenaDrone’s multifunction AI autonomous drones. The company has closed six acquisitions across the US to date as part of its DaaS business model and strategy and has announced it plans to complete approximately 20 more in the next 12 months.

The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

Bitcoin slid on Tuesday as weakness in U.S. tech stocks appeared to spill over into crypto markets. The crypto asset fell about 1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $106,175 at press time as traders took profits after ending June above the $107,000 for its highest-ever monthly close. Sentiment equally soured in equities with shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) both taking heavy losses, dragging the Nasdaq lower by about 0.6% — a pattern that often weighs on digital assets. Tesla was lower by 5.4% in afternoon trade after the Donald Trump/Elon Musk spat re-erupted alongside the momentum for passage of the GOP's spending bill. Major altcoins including Solana SOL$152.47, Cardano ADA$0.5854 and Avalanche AVAX$18.25 posted steep declines, adding to a broader downturn across the crypto space. SOL led the way with a 6% decline following yesterday's spike higher on news of imminent launch of an ETF. Speaking in Europe at an ECB event, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell repeated recent comments about the U.S. economy being in a good spot, thus allowing for patience as the central bank mulls the idea of rate cuts. Powell's comments Tuesday were of particular import given what's now a clear split between him and at least two other Fed members, both of whom would like to see a July rate cut on the table. Powell did allow that a rate cut this month isn't off the table, but gave little indication he's considering easing policy in July. Thanks to the July 4 holiday, the government's employment report for June will be released on Thursday this week. Economists are expecting jobs to have grown by 110,000 in June versus 139,000 the previous month. A sizable delta below that 110,000 level could quickly change sentiment about the Fed's July decision.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. In a period marked by investor caution in the U.S. tech sector, Broadcom Inc. AVGO stands out with a 63% stock rally in just three months. Let’s unpack the compelling narrative behind Broadcom’s exceptional outperformance, delving into its strong second-quarter 2025 results, positive analyst sentiment, and future outlook. Broadcom, a dominant force in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market, focuses on high-performance computing, networking, and storage applications. The company designs and manufactures custom silicon chips for specific tasks, offering high-speed computing, networking, and data center infrastructure advantages. Broadcom’s stock increased by 63% in the last three months, while the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), which includes Broadcom, gained 30% during the same period. Also Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead Fund Manager Buys Even As Semiconductor Sector Cools: Analysts This performance comes even as the U.S. tech sector navigates investor apprehension regarding the sustainability of substantial AI investments by tech giants and the implications of the Trump administration’s tariff policies. Currently, AVGO trades near its 52-week high of approximately $276. Analysts generally hold a positive outlook on Broadcom, with a consensus price forecast of $387.68 based on ratings from 29 analysts. The highest target is $1950, issued by Bernstein on June 13, 2024. The three most recent analyst ratings were released by Citigroup, Barclays, and Susquehanna in June 2025. Broadcom’s second-quarter 2025 revenue reached $15 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, driven by its AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. This revenue figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates of $14.99 billion. The company’s quarterly AI revenue grew 46% to over $4.4 billion, attributed to demand for AI networking. Broadcom generated approximately $6.56 billion in cash from operations and $6.41 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $1.58 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.56. For the third quarter, Broadcom expects revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, aligning with estimates of $15.79 billion. It anticipates AI semiconductor revenue to reach $5.1 billion in the third quarter. These results prompted analysts to adjust price targets for the stock, citing growth in AI-related revenue and demand for networking solutions. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted Broadcom’s potential for long-term AI revenue growth, supported by increased capital expenditures from major cloud firms and the adoption of its custom ASIC silicon. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Cassidy highlighted Broadcom’s visibility into AI growth through key XPU customers and the company’s Ethernet scale-up adoption for LLM training and inference. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Matthew Prisco projects AI semiconductor revenue to exceed $20 billion in 2025 and $30 billion in 2026. Broadcom’s stock has dramatically outpaced its peers, with a 68% surge over the last 12 months compared to the PHLX Semiconductor’s modest 1.3%. In the first half of 2025, Broadcom gained 19% outpacing the S&P 500 gain of 6% and Nasdaq’s 15.5%. The year 2024 was particularly significant, as Broadcom joined the exclusive “trillion-dollar valuation club,” alongside Nvidia Corp. NVDA, fueled by the intensifying AI frenzy. In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom’s revenue reached an impressive $51.6 billion, marking a 44% increase. Semiconductor revenue contributed $30.1 billion, with AI revenue alone soaring 220% to $12.2 billion, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. The integration of VMware significantly boosted infrastructure software revenue to $21.5 billion. The company also notably doubled its AI XPU shipments to hyperscale customers. Despite a significant reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM for nearly 95% of its wafers in fiscal 2024, Broadcom maintained a substantial 64% gross margin, showcasing its strong pricing power and market position. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed strong confidence in December last year, stating that the company could generate tens of billions in annual AI chip revenue by 2027, driven by increasing demand from prominent AI developers like OpenAI and xAI. Analysts echo this optimism. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted that Broadcom has secured multi-year AI ASIC deals with OpenAI and a fifth major client, estimating a $150 billion AI semiconductor opportunity through 2029. BofA Securities’ Vivek Arya believes ASICs could capture 10-15% of the AI accelerator market, supporting Broadcom’s growth even as Nvidia retains a significant market share.

Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.
