Title: Why AMD Is a Much Stronger Investment than Intel (INTC)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: How A.I. Is Actually Changing the Physical World Through ‘Digital Twins’

A digital twin sounds a lot like a long-lost sibling you found on Ancestry, but it has nothing to do with that. Rather, it’s a virtual replica of a real space, such as a warehouse or a factory, that include technology, people and processes. Digital twins have the potential to forever change how these spaces function while impacting millions of jobs in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Manufactured and shipped goods are the lifeblood of our society, and companies around the world are filling warehouses and factories with robots. For example, Walmart in April started rolling out autonomous forklifts in distribution centers. Just this month, the semiconductor maker Lam Research released a collaborative robot (dubbed a “cobot”) to conduct high-precision maintenance on product material. But to introduce robots without a hitch requires serious planning, and digital twins make that possible—all without having to subject workers and the space they inhabit to potentially dangerous environments. “You can simulate sensors, you can simulate robots, you can simulate people, you can simulate machines, you can train your A.I. agents, all of that in the simulated world,” Amit Goel, director of product management for autonomous machines at Nvidia (NVDA), told Observer. Digital twins are particularly useful in tasks like deploying new robots, training and certifying operators, and introducing new manufacturing technologies. “Those tests are cheaper, faster and, most importantly, safer,” Leo Moran, a senior manager at Kalyspo, an automation consulting company, told Observer. “That’s really crucial in a world where the application of robotics is accelerating at an unbelievable pace.” Kalypso offers services like supply chain optimization, autonomous manufacturing and digital twin creation. The company runs 3D models on Nvidia’s Omniverse 3D development platform and the Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform. On Omniverse, for example, Kalypso tests new features like ray tracing, which simulates how light behaves in the real world. (This feature can be used in digital twins of warehouses for a more realistic simulation experience.) “The renderings look amazing. You can look at how light moves, how objects interact. It looks much more real so you get out of that uncanny valley you often have in this space,” Moran said. More than the beauty they evoke, these digital replicas allow companies to ask questions such as “What are the safety implications of having 50 robots in a room instead of 20?” and “Will people still be able to safely move through there?”—all without subjecting workers to uncertain environments, Moran added. While digital twins are arguably one of the most influential behind-the-scene elements working to upend the industrial sector as we know it, they’re not all roses. Building digital twins can be really expensive because of the computing power they require, said Nvidia’s Goel. In November, Nvidia released a suite of generative A.I. blueprint models to help propel clients to create digital twins at scales as large as entire warehouses at the highest fidelity. Moran noted the biggest challenge isn’t necessarily the technology itself, but the people building and operating it. “It’s a very multi-disciplinary job,” he said. “You need to have an understanding of robotics, automation, computer science, controls engineering, mechanical engineering. The supply for talent does not meet the demand today.” Sometimes called mechatronics engineering by institutions like Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Rochester Institute of Technology, this sort of multidisciplinary education is still catching up with the technology industry’s needs.

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/12/semiconductor-stocks-exposed-to-china-with-tariffs-incoming/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T19:47:51Z
Full Content:
Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year.

Despite mounting trade restrictions, Nvidia (NVDA-2.43%) is significantly expanding its presence in China, focusing on artificial intelligence chips for autonomous vehicles, Bloomberg reports. Both a Chinese government antitrust investigation and escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington complicate the semiconductor giant’s efforts. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia has boosted its China workforce by a third, going from a 3,000-employee headcount at the start of the year to its current 4,000-employee headcount. Among those hires are a team dedicated to self-driving cars. The expansion comes amid heightened Chinese regulatory scrutiny of U.S. technology firms, particularly those developing artificial intelligence systems. National security concerns have intensified as defense contractors and military suppliers increase their AI investments, adding to the economic tensions between the two nations. Last week, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. In turn, China announced that it would be curbing exports of the raw materials used to build those semiconductors to the U.S. Additionally, Nvidia itself is in the middle of an antitrust investigation by Chinese authorities regarding a chipmaker it acquired in 2020.

In a historic turn, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has once again taken the top spot, with a whopping 90% of the global GPU market share in Q3 2024. This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Assetera, a Polygon-powered MiFID-licensed trading venue for blockchain-based securities in Europe, has listed Backed Finance's tokenized assets, offering non-U.S. investors to gain exposure to trackers linked to some of the most sought-after U.S. companies. The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens. When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading. These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. "This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation in financial markets and the empowerment of investors globally," Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera, said, as Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said it allows investors to get exposure to traditional financial assets via an onchain and regulated environment. Asset tokenization is the process of using blockchain technology to convert a traditional asset's value into a digital token, facilitating 24/7 availability, access for all, composability and instant global collateral mobility. A 2022 projection by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the value of the tokenized asset market at an astounding $16 trillion in 2030 versus less than $100 billion today. Regulatory uncertainty and security concerns have long hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets, but Assetera is tackling these challenges using rigorous adults to mitigate vulnerabilities. The company told CoinDesk that it uses AI-powered real-time monitoring systems to detect and address suspicious activity, adding that Backend's robust and scalable infrastructure and expertise in democratizing finance through tokenization solidified the partnership.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

Title: China's top smartphone player is still years behind the U.S.

Despite its comeback to compete with Apple in the Chinese smartphone market, Huawei’s latest smartphone shows it is still years behind, researchers found. In November, the Chinese tech giant launched its Mate 70 smartphone series, including the Mate 70 Pro Plus, which is powered by a Kirin 9020 processor. The chip, however, uses 7-nanometer processing technology — the same process node used in the Mate 60 that it released last August, according to a teardown by researchers at TechInsights. The 7-nanometer process node means Huawei is about 5 years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.99%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia (NVDA-2.43%) and Apple (AAPL+0.11%), which released its first 7-nanometer chip in 2018. In April, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Huawei’s Mate 60 signaled that U.S. export controls on advanced technology “are working because that chip is not nearly as good” and “years behind what we have in the United States.” “We were expecting to find the Kirin 9100 chipset in the Mate 70 line-up,” TechInsights said, adding that China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which manufactures chips for Huawei, was rumored to have used 5-nanometer processing technology for the chip. TSMC, which makes a majority of the world’s advanced chips, has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. Meanwhile, Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process, Bloomberg reported in November. The stalled efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML+0.87%). In October, TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip and found TSMC-made technology — a possible violation of U.S. trade restrictions. At the same time, SMIC is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Pause Likely Due to Liquidity Factors and Nvidia's Stalled Rally

For the third week, bitcoin (BTC) remains locked in a price range between $90,000 and $100,000, punctuated only by Dec. 5's short-lived rise into six figures.This indecisive price action might have left traders feeling uninspired, with two key reasons holding back the upside. First, the influx of liquidity into the crypto market through channels like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has significantly slowed, taking the wind out of the bullish momentum. The weekly rate of change in the so-called market liquidity impulse index, which tracks stablecoin mints, inflows into BTC ETFs and changes in futures market parameters, has more than halved to $7 billion from highs above $15 billion seen early last month, according to data tracked by 10x Research. "This slowdown in liquidity growth may partially explain why bitcoin is struggling to sustain levels above $100,000," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Wednesday. The liquidity indicator has chalked out lower highs of late, diverging bearishly from BTC's price. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. Meanwhile, ETFs are preferred investment vehicles for those looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. The same can be said about CME's cash-settled futures. The other reason, overlooked by most pundits, is the slowdown in the uptrend in shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's biggest company. Since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, NVDA has emerged as a bellwether for all things AI and risk assets in general. BTC and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and boasted a strong positive correlation since then, barring the summer, when supply overhang fears kept BTC from tracking NVDA higher. As of writing, the three-month correlation between the two was 0.6. Analysts at TheMarketEar believe BTC, with its post-U.S. election surge from $70,000 to $100,000, has caught up with NVDA "Same psychology; winners like winners. BTC has 'caught up' to NVDA. They have little fundamentals in common but are driven by similar psychology," analysts at TheMarketEar said in a note to clients, adding that NVDA is one of the few stocks that has outperformed BTC this year and over the last five years. While BTC has risen 130% this year, NVDA has gained 172%, according to data source TradingView. NVDA's uptrend, however, has run out of steam since mid-November, with prices now teasing a bearish reversal pattern for heads and shoulders. Besides, the one-year put-call skew now shows calls trading at par with puts, exhibiting a neutral sentiment as opposed to a strong call (bullish) bias early this year, according to data source Market Chameleon. That said, bullish excesses have been crowded out from the crypto market, as noted in Tuesday's edition of the Crypto Daybook Americas. With the market normalized to more healthy leverage levels, we could see BTC having another go at the $100,000 mark, but sustainability of the breakout likely depends on liquidity inflows and broader risk sentiment.

Title: Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares continued to slide on Tuesday, falling more than 3% after a Chinese regulator announced that it was investigating the chipmaker for possible violations of the country’s antimonopoly law. On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China. The country’s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so. South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing’s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington’s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China’s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China’s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia’s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe. The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia’s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an “earlier pop”. Historically, December hasn’t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously. Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks this Week. Paul Hickey, Bespoke Investment Group co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that despite the market gains still concentrated in a few names, he’s bullish short and long term because of AI. “The longer term play is the AI trade. This is an AI bull market. Every bull market has a theme, and ChatGPT was to AI what Netscape and AOL were to the internet.” Hickey also mentioned the possible scenario where market gains would start to broaden out. “ChatGPT didn’t invent AI; it made it tangible for consumers and businesses, just like Netscape with the internet. It caused, you know, made it a lot more practical on the part of businesses and the consumer. So I think in that respect, there’s a lot more investment to go, and we’ve seen the infrastructure stocks in AI benefit. But even just last week, some of these software names—and we’re going to slowly start to see that broaden out to the rest of the economy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Commenting on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) results last month, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that when Nvidia said in its call that the demand would surpass supplies for the next “several quarters,” it set the bar lower for those who “believe the dreams.” “They just reset the bar lower. Things are going to accelerate as you go into next year, and so, depending, you’re in a really great seasonal time of year for stocks. People just want to believe in the Santa Claus rally.” Niles then made his case for the expected slowdown and reality check for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the future: “You’re going to, at some point next year, run into an issue where you’ll need to see a return on investment for the money you’re putting in. Think about Microsoft—they cut estimates after the June quarter report and again after the September quarter report. At their Ignite conference, they even mentioned hitting a wall, potentially with scaling loss. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia’s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers — which account for 50% of its revenue — are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia’s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins. Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA’s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA’s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA’s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company’s revenue, which presents added risk.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks this Week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By Greg Guenthner Posted December 10, 2024 We’ve seen this show before… Just four short years ago, stocks and crypto were ripping to new highs at a rate that alarmed many conservative investors. Due to Covid’s warping of the space-time continuum, December 2020 feels like it was just yesterday and eons ago at the same time. In case you’ve memory-holed the second half of the year of lockdowns and Covid panic, I’ll set the stage… The weather was getting colder as winter approached in late 2020. Many areas of the country were heading back into lockdown mode as Covid cases spiked. The country had almost made it through the first year of the pandemic. But a new class of stock market speculators was starting to get anxious. Stuck at their white-collar work-from-home jobs, these young bucketeers started bidding up every crazy stock and crypto they could find. Message boards, including the now-infamous “Wall Street Bets” on Reddit, attracted mainstream attention. And social media personalities like Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy live-streamed the opening bell as they bid up random tickers, hoping to land the next 10-bagger. Of course, stock market seasonality helped fuel the flames. It was the perfect time for a year-end melt up, everyone was stuck inside, and they had cash to burn. Stocks soared and the early 2021 NFT bubble began to inflate, as well as the options-fueled squeezes in meme stocks like GME. Does any of this sound familiar? The pandemic might be over. But we’re seeing history rhyme this month as a holiday market boom rivaling 2020’s Covid bubble begins to unfold. Crypto has taken center stage early with Bitcoin pushing toward a $100K breakout extension. Alt-coins are flourishing. Heck, I even joined the ranks by grabbing some DOGE as it rallied 300% off its lows to set up for what could be an even bigger breakout “Meme stocks” might not be the biggest beneficiaries of the speculation this time around – but many forgotten stocks and sectors are catching a bid and running in the current market environment. The smaller, the better! Just look at the evolution of AI mania as the year has progressed… NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) led the artificial intelligence charge during the first six months of 2024, breaking out in early January and bolting higher by more than 175% into late June. NVDA slowed down in the summer after hogging the spotlight (and most of the gains). But the big semis started to slow down in the summer. And while NVDA and the semis have picked up the pace, they aren’t the only game in town. The risk-takers have moved down the cap scale to the smaller, more speculative artificial intelligence names. These are the stocks that are ripping higher in this environment! C3.ai (AI) has jumped nearly 65% since mid-November. BBAI has gained as much as 150% over that same timeframe. And SoundHound AI Inc. (SOUN) has exploded 190% off its early November lows. AI speculations soar into melt-up season To be clear, these stocks didn’t suddenly firm up and start to run because of any fundamental changes or a surprise news event. We’re simply seeing traders rotating into the smaller, more speculative names in the industry. I don’t know what will happen with these stocks once the music stops. That goes for these AI names — or any other small, reenergized stock that’s posting a huge rally right now. But I do know how markets work — and parabolic rallies like these rarely lead to clean, sideways consolidation. There will be downside action when the rally ebbs. Some of these stocks will reset to logical new support levels and then build bases at those prices before continuing higher. Others will retrace the entire melt-up move and slowly die on the vine. There is no other way! This doesn’t mean you have to completely avoid the melt-up darlings. But you do have to adjust your expectations… One of the biggest hurdles new traders need to clear is learning how to deal with different market environments. When you first begin to develop your unique trading strategy, you will naturally want to use it consistently to book regular gains. The problem is that consistently is often replaced with constantly. Newer traders regularly force trades in less-than-ideal environments because they can’t tear themselves away from the action. They’re chasing breakouts when breakouts aren’t working, or they’re buying stocks and sectors that are out of favor for one reason or another. It’s not that they’re taking too much risk – they’re taking the wrong kind of risk. This misunderstanding can even work against traders who, on the surface, believe they are acting conservatively. If you’re a swing trader attempting to play a small move in mega-cap semiconductor plays when the smaller AI names are working, you’re taking the wrong kind of risk. And it’s costing you! As I explained last week when I detailed my uncharacteristic meme coin trade, I’m more concerned about the trades I’m not involved with right now. In melt-up conditions, the biggest risk for traders is ignoring these impressive rallies. I routinely review my trading performance, going back over the previous six to twelve months to see how I’ve fared. During this process, I’m not very interested in counting my winners. Instead, I want to review where my losses came from, what mistakes I made, and where I can improve. Again, this process isn’t about win rates or victory laps. It’s about pinpointing where I could have made different decisions, especially as it relates to emotional blind spots I might have had at the time of the trade. Next week, I’ll dig into some of the lessons learned during my 2020 Covid trading campaign. I’ll show you how a great trade doesn’t always yield ideal results, and reveal what you can do to maximize your melt-up gains. Stay tuned…

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%. GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an "underperform" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday. Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations. European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, a signal that demand for AI-focused chips remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. The company reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion), down 12% from October's figures, while revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Banks Favor King Dollar as BTC Tug-of-War Rages

In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's bull-bear tug-of-war continues to rage, with prices recovering to over $97,000 from Monday's dip to $94,200. The slide was prompted by concern Google's new quantum-computing chip, Willow, could compromise BTC's security — a worry quickly dismissed by analysts. That leaves directional traders with little to do other than wait for the dust to settle before picking a side, as prices remain locked in Thursday's indecisive trading range. But there’s a silver lining! The turbulence has crowded out those undisciplined, overleveraged altcoin traders, as is evident from perpetual funding rates. Altcoin rates have receded closer to the center of Velo Data's heat map, which oscillates between -200% and 200%, indicating more balanced conditions than the bullish extremes of last week. Tokens like Stacks' STX even sport negative funding rates, a perfect entry point for bulls, according to pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General. "If these rates continue to decline, it could signal the unwinding of excessive long leverage, potentially leading to a more balanced market," analysts at Bitfinex said, adding that $100,000 is no longer the key support/resistance level and a new equilibrium is probably forming in spot markets. That said, as we look toward the end of 2024, there’s a developing story: Banks are getting bullish on the dollar, which doesn’t usually bode well for assets denominated in the U.S. currency, like BTC and risk assets. "The combination of cyclical, fiscal, and U.S. political forces is making the USD stronger again," HSBC said recently. "We update our USD bullish view further; the USD bubble is re-inflating, which spells trouble ahead for many other currencies." Citibank sees the dollar index (DXY) rallying to 115, an 8% increase. Keep an eye on the Far East too. A renewed rally in Chinese stocks following Beijing's promise of more stimulus could suck capital from other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid all this, there's talk President-elect Trump may struggle to deliver his crypto promises. Peter Tschir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, put it best: "Trump does have loyalty to those who helped fund his campaign, but I don't see this as a lasting relationship, especially as he will likely get a lot of pressure from the National Security element of D.C. to be cautious on helping crypto too much." After all, it's one thing to promise big from Mar-a-Lago and a different ball game when delivering from the White House. Stay Alert! By Shaurya MalwaEverything with "quantum" in the name is pumping! Various tokens themed after, or claiming to use, quantum computing within their technology stack jumped more than 100% in the past 24 hours after internet giant Google unveiled Willow, a quantum-computing chip that took 5 minutes to solve tasks during its testing period that would have taken 10 septillion years for current supercomputers to finish. Crypto markets took a hit after the announcement on concerns the development was long-term bearish for bitcoin and other blockchains, whose security features can, in theory, be exploited by quantum computers.But while the entire market dropped, tokens such as Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Quantum Network, Quantum Swap, among others, zoomed higher.Quantum-resistant or post-quantum tokens aim to use cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against quantum computing attacks. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks using Shor’s algorithm, which is particularly effective against current public-key cryptosystems. Tokens labeled with "quantum" might be perceived as being at the forefront of technology, even if their actual utility or relation to quantum computing is minimal. This perception can drive investment — and a chance to speculate on the short-term trading narrative.

Title: AI regulation will slow innovation to speed it up, DataStax CEO says

As artificial intelligence continues to barrel forward with increasingly capable models and applications, DataStax chief executive Chet Kapoor thinks governments will be more involved in the rollout of the technology — and that won’t necessarily be a bad thing. While Kapoor said he’s generally not in favor of government intervention because it risks stifling innovation, he’s all for it when it comes to AI. “Governments will have to be a little bit more involved,” the CEO said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video interview series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite (NDAQ). “We will need to think about governance from a country perspective, from an industry perspective, from a company perspective.” “In doing all of that, we may slow down things a little bit,” said Kapoor, whose company is a data platform providing stacks used by enterprises to build generative AI applications. “But we’ll be slowing it down to speed it up.” AI raises a number of red flags that regulators around the world will be forced to contend with, including data privacy, cybersecurity, and algorithmic biases. Although there are no federal rules explicitly aimed at AI in the U.S., the Biden administration has released an executive order on the safe use and development of AI, as well as a blueprint for a so-called “AI Bill of Rights.” Both documents aim to mitigate some of the risks associated with AI and lay the groundwork for further legislation. But President-elect Donald Trump has taken an deregulatory stance on most industries, particularly the financial services and housing sectors. When it comes to AI, he reportedly plans to repeal the Biden-era executive order and could instruct federal agencies to take a more hands-off approach to AI. Given that any number of guardrails could slow the progress on AI, albeit temporarily, Kapoor isn’t worried about AI outpacing what his company can provide. He’s excited about the opportunities AI is creating for companies — both AI native and non-native alike — to bolster their technological capabilities. “The AI natives get AI intuitively, they’re building their companies, their apps and things like that on it. They know exactly how to bring the different pieces together,” Kapoor said. “And I’m not talking about OpenAI and Google (GOOGL), I’m talking about the people starting companies in garages and the new Salesforces.” “The real fun, the real opportunity is not just those companies,” he added. “The real opportunity is how do you make sure that 30 million developers who are developing technology all over the world can actually use tools to build gen AI apps?” In October, DataStax announced its DataStax AI Platform, built using Nvidia (NVDA) AI. The platform, which integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise software, reduces AI development time by 60%, the company said. Kapoor said DataStax’s partnership with Nvidia has allowed the company to offer a tool that helps make developers more agile, and makes developing genAI apps more cost effective and scalable. “At the end of the day, we care about two things. Just two things,” he said. “We care about building products that developers love, that change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for. Nvidia helps us with both.” Watch the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor above. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
