SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia’s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald’s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company’s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, “The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we’re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute." For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia’s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels—etch and deposition tools—needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia’s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam’s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.

After it delivered another record quarter, all eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) announcements at its annual GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell artificial intelligence platform at last year’s conference — known as the GTC — which has now “successfully ramped up” large-scale production and is “achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Demand for the chips, which faced production delays due to design flaws and overheating issues, is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models, according to Huang. On the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call, Huang said he will discuss the company’s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, its next-generation AI platform, Vera Rubin, and its plans for following products at the conference. During the company’s earnings call in May, Huang announced that Nvidia already had another chip coming after Blackwell, and that the company is “on a one-year rhythm.” The following month, Huang announced Blackwell Ultra and the Rubin platform during an appearance at COMPUTEX in Taiwan. During the call with analysts on Wednesday, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The upcoming developers conference will be “another positive catalyst to help solidify the performance advantages of Blackwell and lay a framework for continued AI spending, particularly on the inference side,” Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday. Despite surpassing revenue and guidance expectations, Nvidia’s shares fell on Thursday as some investors were left unimpressed by its results. However, Nvidia is expected to “get the market excited about everything in the product pipeline,” at the GTC next month, John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, shared similar sentiments, saying Nvidia’s “real story is its rapid cadence of innovation,” in comments shared with Quartz. “With GTC around the corner, I expect further product announcements to build on today’s momentum.” The GTC takes place between March 17 and 21, and Huang will deliver his keynote address on March 18.

A.I. agents may be all the rage right now, but Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is already looking beyond the hype. A.I.’s next phase will be “physical A.I.,” he said during Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call yesterday (Feb. 26). Physical A.I. is a form of A.I. systems that can interact directly with the real world and encompasses products like autonomous vehicles and robots. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Now is the beginning of the agentic A.I. era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it. Then, there’s physical A.I. after that,” Huang told analysts. He went on to explain, “They can’t just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence and cause and effect.” To this effect, Nvidia in January unveiled a platform of “world models,” which attempt to simulate real-world environments. Known as Cosmos, the new platform promises to advance the training of physical A.I. systems by providing highly realistic virtual worlds. Self-driving cars, for example, could be tested across various simulated weather conditions, while robotics companies could examine the safety of their products in different scenarios. Cosmos has already been adopted by robotics companies like 1X and Neura Robotics and autonomous vehicle makers like Waabi and Wayve. The platform is also working with Uber (UBER) as it explores robotaxi products, Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress said yesterday. “Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language A.I., Cosmos is a physical A.I. to revolutionize robotics,” she added. “World models” is a concept picking up steam in A.I. Last year, Fei-Fei Li, a renowned computer scientist and leading figure in A.I. research, founded World Labs, which looks to infuse A.I. with “spatial intelligence” that understands and interacts with the real world. The startup raised $230 million last year and unveiled an early glimpse of its progress in generating virtual 3D scenes from 2D images. For the time being, A.I. developers are heavily focusing on agents, with leaders like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) emphasizing autonomous, action-taking features in recent A.I. releases. Nvidia is doing just fine in the agentic A.I. era. The company’s quarterly revenue surged 78 percent year-over-year to $39.3 billion, the vast majority of which came from its data center business. Profit during the quarter jumped 80 percent to $22 billion. Nvidia’s physical A.I. dreams remain a minuscule part of its business, with its automotive and robotics division accounting for less than 2 percent of the company’s total revenue during the November-January quarter. This share will rise in the future. “Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars,” Huang told analysts, adding that Nvidia will “be improving them using an A.I. factory” powered by physical A.I. Despite exceeding Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and net income, some investors were spooked by Nvidia’s underwhelming gross margin outlook. Nvidia’s stock is down by more than 3 percent today. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) finished the fiscal year by delivering record revenue and outlook above expectations for the fourth quarter — and more than doubling its full-year revenue from the previous year. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s full-year revenue grew 114% year over year to a record $130.5 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, adding that demand for the new chips is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. According to Nvidia’s 10-K filing, just three anonymous customers made up more than 30% of total revenue for the fiscal year ended in January. “Direct Customer A” accounted for 12% of total revenue, while Direct Customers B and C each represented 11%, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Direct Customer B made up 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, the filing said. All of the sales “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” according to the filing. For the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia had reported revenue of $35.1 billion — 36% of which came from three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, according to the company’s Form 10-Q. The filing also showed that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. Although the chipmaker will not disclose the companies, its top customers could likely include Alphabet (GOOGL+0.12%), Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta (META+0.42%), Microsoft (MSFT0.00%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%).

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) delivered another record quarter and raised outlook on strong demand for its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, confirming that Big Tech’s big spending on AI will continue, analysts said. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Fiscal first quarter guidance was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “It was logical to be concerned about the ramping of Blackwell, but we have now successfully ramped Blackwell,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a post-earnings appearance on CNBC (CMCSA+0.95%). Huang added that he believes Nvidia is “successfully behind the air pocket” in demand over which investors raised concerns as customers transitioned from Hopper to Blackwell. “We’re going to have a good quarter next quarter. And we’ve got a fairly good pipeline of demand for Blackwell,” Huang said. Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that “[t]he supply chain should continue to improve,” and that they “see no signs of demand issues,” for Blackwell. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “The recent setback in Nvidia’s stock from DeepSeek and the narrative that AI demand would decline proved unfounded as customers continue to race to scale AI infrastructure, largely with Nvidia chips,” Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, also said he doesn’t think DeepSeek will “clobber demand for Nvidia’s data centre chips” in comments shared with Quartz. The chipmaker’s expectations for the current fiscal year “look to be about right which combined with the good visibility that I think the company has means that there will be few surprises this year,” Windsor said. Meanwhile, concerns by investors over Nvidia’s top customers designing their own custom chips “appear overdone,” Sun said. “Nvidia’s ecosystem advantages and software stack remain formidable barriers to entry.” On its post-earnings call, Nvidia said the reasoning AI models over which firms such as OpenAI and Google are competing “can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.” The company “is uniquely positioned to capture this exponential growth,” Sun said.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.16%), Micron (MU+1.00%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%), and Intel (INTC+2.40%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-1.62%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. Technology company Nvidia will report fourth-quarter earnings today after the closing bell. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia, the chipmaker that fueled 22% of the S&P 500’s total returns in 2024 with a 171.25% stock surge, continues to ride the AI wave into 2025. Its latest quarterly earnings, released after market close Wednesday, showcase a company still firing on all cylinders—yet the market’s response hints at a maturing narrative. With the stock down 2.24% year-to-date entering earnings, investors are wrestling with whether Nvidia’s meteoric rise can sustain its momentum amid economic uncertainty and shifting tech priorities. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, covering the period ending January 26, 2025, smashed expectations. The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, a 78% leap from $22.1 billion a year ago and a 12% increase from the prior quarter’s $35.1 billion, according to a press release issued by Nvidia. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.89, up 82% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share matched at $0.89, a 71% annual gain. The data center segment, Nvidia’s AI powerhouse, soared to $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year, driven by booming demand for its Blackwell and Hopper GPU platforms. CEO Jensen Huang touted the results on the Q4 earnings call, saying, “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law—increasing compute makes models smarter.” The Blackwell platform, ramping up to “massive-scale production,” contributed billions in sales this quarter alone, per Huang’s remarks. Since November 2024, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have traded sideways, with all three posting negative year-to-date returns. The S&P 500, tethered to these giants, has stalled alongside them as the U.S. economy faces turbulence with incoming policy shifts—tariffs, tax changes, and deregulation—under a new administration. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT 12-Month Returns The two-year rally in Big Tech, propelled by artificial intelligence hype, could be hitting a ceiling as firms pivot from raw compute power to efficiency. Innovations like DeepSeek’s compute-light AI models suggest a future where Nvidia’s dominance might face pressure. Competitors such as AMD and Intel are developing alternatives to Nvidia’s AI offerings. AMD’s Instinct MI300 series has secured adoption in cloud computing environments. However, Nvidia’s ecosystem, supported by its CUDA software platform and established partnerships with major hyperscalers, continues to hold a leading position in the AI chip market. Optimists eyeing AI’s secular growth might see Nvidia’s dip as a buy signal, but broader exposure could be wiser. The Nasdaq and S&P 500—down 3.1% and 1.8% year-to-date, respectively, per today’s close, are laden with AI-adjacent firms, offering upside with less single-stock risk. Nvidia’s Q4 2024 earnings cement its AI supremacy—$130.5 billion in fiscal-year revenue, up 114%, speaks for itself. But as the market digests its maturity and braces for economic twists, the era of unchecked gains may be cooling. Investors should weigh diversification and patience in this volatile new chapter.

Title: Nvidia beats fiscal fourth quarter expectations on Blackwell demand

Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) revenue and outlook topped analysts’ expectations, driven by demand for its new Blackwell chips. The stock fluctuated in after-hours trading after closing up 3.7%. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year and an all-time high. Consensus had been for $38.1 billion. Net income was $22 billion for earnings per share of 89 cents, also beats. Nvidia’s full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. The company’s gross margins will be in the low 70s, but is expected to return to the mid-70s later in the fiscal year as Blackwell fully ramps up, CFO Colette Kress said on Nvidia’s earnings call. Nvidia’s data center revenue rose 93% year on year to a record $35.6 billion last quarter. However, data center sales in China remain low due to restrictions, Kress said, adding that the company will continue complying with chip export controls. Ahead of the earnings, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up production of its Blackwell chips — despite shockwaves from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. In December, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. The startup’s powerful reasoning model, R1, spooked investors in January, causing Nvidia’s stock to plunge 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told Quartz ahead of the results. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet.” Encouraging updates on production and shipments of the Blackwell platform will probably move the stock, Kunjan Sobhani, lead semiconductor analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Quartz ahead of earnings. Investors are wary of a potential “air pocket” in growth between the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year as customers move to Blackwell from Hopper, he said. “That is the spot when the Hopper shipments could really come down, and the Blackwell ramp — from a quarter to quarter perspective — might not be enough to show significant sequential growth,” Sobhani said, adding that Blackwell could “catch up in the second half.” For Nvidia’s reputation and valuation, “the sequential expectations matter,” Sobhani said. “If they say something which agitates this sort of concern further, that could imply temporary volatility in the sentiment and the stock.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 26, 2025, of $39.3 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 78% from a year ago. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 14% from the previous quarter and up 82% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 71% from a year ago. For fiscal 2025, revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $2.94, up 147% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $2.99, up 130% from a year ago. “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law — increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on April 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on March 12, 2025. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Summary Fiscal 2025 Summary *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024. Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

U.S. stocks gave up their early gains to close mixed on Wednesday as U.S. bond yields fell again amid confusing comments from Donald Trump about tariffs on Canada and Mexico and after more lackluster economic data. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock ended up 3.67% ahead of its earnings later today. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were little changed and the Dow Jones Industrial average lost about 188 points. Apple (AAPL+0.89%) stock fell 2.7% and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%) closed about 4% lower at $290.80, giving up earlier gains. The president pushed back the deadline for tariffs on the U.S.’s neighbors to April 2 from March 4. While this buoyed the Mexican peso and the loonie, it left investors uncertain and skeptical about Trump’s actual plans for duties, and may have reduced the issue’s importance for traders going forward. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. Shares of AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged after an attack by two short-sellers. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000.

Title: Nvidia earnings live updates: Wall Street watching chip demand and guidance around DeepSeek

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

U.S. stocks erased early gains on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s highly anticipated earnings report. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 0.2% and 0.01%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial index shed 0.4%. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000. Here are stocks to watch today: AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged in New York trading on Wednesday after two short-seller reports that questioned the integrity of its AI-driven AXON advertising software. Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research both issued reports that claimed the company, which offers marketing services to app developers, had misrepresented the advantages of its AI platform and was misleadingly “force-feeding” app installations to users’ phones to inflate revenue. Axon (AXON-0.38%) stock surged after the weapons and surveillance technology company reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and issued upbeat full-year guidance. Axon posted adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, topping the analysts’ average of $1.40. Revenue climbed to $575.1 million from $544.3 million a year earlier. Intuit (INTU+1.39%) stock rose sharply following a strong earnings report and mixed guidance for the current period.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged more than 16% Wednesday morning after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. The San Jose-based company filed its delayed annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, along with quarterly earnings for the periods ending Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, after the market closed on Tuesday. “Today’s filings represent an important milestone,” said CEO Charles Liang. He added that the company is heavily investing in talent and processes across key departments to drive its mission in DLC, Data Center Building Block Solution (Supermicro 4.0), and revenue goals. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro’s stock has been on the rise, especially following its latest earnings report filed earlier this month. The report showcased a strong outlook and an ambitious 2026 target, drawing investor interest. Currently, the stock is trading around $53 per share, marking a 76% gain this year. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. However, Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The crypto market is looking to regain some poise after yesterday's tumble with on-chain indicators showing signs of capitulation in bitcoin. Some tokens, like MakerDAO's MKR, stand out with a 20% gain in 24 hours, thanks to the DAO's buyback and burn process. IP, the native token of decentralized intellectual property-focused blockchain Story Protocol, is also in the green, having risen nearly 40%. The token's price has doubled in two weeks after being listed on South Korean exchanges. Other notable outperformers include Celestia's TIA along with XDC, QNT and HYPE. Data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows whales have been buying the dip in the HYPE token. XRP, meanwhile, is hanging on to a key Fibonacci level, keeping bulls' hope for bigger gains alive. According to Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the crypto market is digesting the end of the recent memecoin frenzy, which could be replaced by productive sectors such as stablecoins, real-world assets and DeFi. "But until they start making their presence felt, the loss of energy will create a drag on the market," Hougan said on X. On the macroeconomic front, the optimism seen after the Nov. 4 election is being replaced by caution, as evidenced by Tuesday's release of the U.S. consumer confidence. The gauge dropped to an eight-month low, and the one-year inflation expectations were highest for 1.5 years, with President Donald Trump's tariffs singled out as the primary concern in almost every household and business survey. The dour sentiment and a strengthening yen might keep the upside in risk assets restricted for some time. Earlier this week, Belgium's central bank's head, Pierre Wunsch, warned that the ECB risks sleep-walking into too many rate cuts. The Fed, for its part, is unlikely to do QE anytime soon. (Sure, the January meeting minutes discussed an end of quantitive tightening, but that does not mean quantitative easing.) Speaking of key events to watch out for, the Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis, is set to revisit crypto regulations during Wednesday's scheduled hearing titled “Exploring Bipartisan Legislative Frameworks for Digital Assets."

Title: NVIDIA Insiders Sell $1.6 Billion Of Stock, Buy Nothing A Year Ahead Of Today’s Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With NVIDIA due to report another highly crucial earnings results later today, data shows that insiders have sold as much as $1.6 billion in stock over the year heading into the results. Investor hype surrounding NVIDIA's shares and its ability to drive the AI revolution has meant that the stock become the most valuable in the world multiple times ahead of last month's DeepSeek selloff. However, since then, NVIDIA's shares have failed to regain their lost glory as investors remain on the sideline to gauge demand for its products before buying more stock. Since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT, NVIDIA's shares have been on a tear and have been among the top performers on Wall Street. Since November 2022, they have gained 678% and led to many of the firm's employees becoming millionaires. The richest NVIDIA employee is CEO and founder Jensen Huang who owns 3.5% of the shares of the company that he set up in 1993. Huang is the 13th richest person in the world and is currently worth $113 billion. NVIDIA, on the other hand, is worth $3.1 trillion and is the second most valuable company in the world. Ahead of it is Cupertino, California, consumer technology giant Apple Inc, which leads by $600 billion on the market capitalization pyramid and is worth $4.7 trillion. However, NVIDIA sat at the top of the pyramid in January before the DeepSeek selloff recalibrated the stock market. Its shares lost 17% during the day, and while they have gained 6.9% since the DeepSeek bottom, the stock is yet to reach its previous highs. The firm's upcoming earnings report is expected to set the tone for its GPU demand and Blackwell availability for the rest of the year. So far, the consensus among investors is that Blackwell deliveries have been pushed into the second half of the year. NVIDIA's shares reflect the unease, as they have lost 9.62% in the days heading into the earnings. NVIDIA insiders also appear to have sold billions of dollars of stock over the year heading into the earnings. As per data shared on X, they have sold $1.6 billion of stock heading into earnings. Some notable sales include those by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and chief financial officer Collette Kress. For instance, Huang sold $8.62 million of shares in mid-December when the stock was trading at $135 while Kress cumulatively unloaded $18.62 million worth of shares on the same day. Another notable insider that has sold the stock is NVIDIA's field operations lead Ajay Puri who has sold more than $40 million worth of shares. NVIDIA's less-than-stellar share price performance ahead of the earnings has made the stock quite cheap, according to investment advisory Evercore ISI. In a fresh investment note, the firm kept a $190 share price target and an Overweight rating on the shares as it shared that with a 30x forward-price-to-earnings multiple, NVIDIA's shares were the cheapest in its AI coverage universe. BREAKING: In the last year, Nvidia, $NVDA, insiders have only sold. They have sold up to $1,602,674,927.72 in stock.

Title: Amid an Uncertain Year, Can Nvidia Soothe Wall Street’s Nerves?

Nvidia (NVDA) has had a bumpy start of 2025. Share price of the A.I. chip giant surged to record highs at the beginning of the year and then fell sharply in late January after the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley. Now, analysts are eagerly anticipating Nvidia’s fourth-quarter and 2024 financial results, set to release tomorrow (Feb. 26), to gauge its actual position in the A.I. race. Nvidia is the world’s second most valuable public company with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion, meaning its earnings report could also have major implications for the broader stock market.

You can opt out anytime. Wall Street expects Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to soar 72 percent to $38 billion and profit to jump 64 percent to $19.6 billion. But to keep its share price on an upward trajectory, the company might have to do even better. To avoid a sell-off, Nvidia must meet its “normal exceed,” Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, told Fortune. While DeepSeek’s cost-efficient breakthrough initially led investors to believe demand for A.I. chips could fall, some analysts have pushed back on such fears. “We believe that A.I. GPU demand still exceeds supply, so while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this A.I. ‘gold rush,’” said Brian Colello, a Morningstar analyst, in a January note. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek in a recent interview for “making everybody take notice” of opportunities for more efficient A.I. models. While the initial market response suggested Wall Street was losing faith in compute investments, Huang claimed “it’s exactly the opposite,” given the “fairly compute-intensive” nature of reasoning-focused models like DeepSeek’s R1. But Nvidia stock took another hit on Feb. 21, falling 4 percent after the investment bank TD Cowen reported that Microsoft has cancelled leases for at least two data center operators. The news sparked concerns over a decline in demand for A.I. compute. “It points to a potential oversupply position,” said TD Cowen analysts in the report. In response, Microsoft noted that it is “well positioned” to meet increasing demand but may “strategically pace or adjust” its infrastructure in some areas. Nvidia’s earnings come amid a broader market downturn. Last week, major indexes saw their worst day this year so far in response to weaker-than-expected economic reports on the U.S. services sector and consumer sentiment. But when it comes to A.I., tech bulls are confident that Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will put an end to Wall Street’s caution. While the market is “heavily skewed negative right now around tech sentiment,” Nvidia’s upcoming performance should “calm the nerves of investors,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a client note. Updates on Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip and demand from Big Tech clients will continue to fuel optimism towards the technology, Ives added. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to spend more than $300 billion cumulatively this year on A.I. efforts, including buying Nvidia chips. “After speaking with many enterprise A.I. customers, we have not seen one A.I. enterprise slow down or change,” said Ives, who added that no clients want to “lose their place in line” for Nvidia’s next-gen chips. During Nvidia’s last earnings call in November, Huang noted that Blackwell production was “in full steam.” The success of Nvidia’s transition to its next-gen GPUs will be closely watched when the company reports earnings tomorrow. “All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary,” according to Hans Mosemann, an analyst with Rosenblatt who predicts that Huang will reaffirm that demand for shipments remains high throughout 2025. “We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger [second half].” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Wall Street eyes 'growing pains' in Nvidia earnings but all eyes are on a bullish 2nd half for its next-gen chip

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

As Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.33%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+0.42%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY-2.67%), Alibaba (BABA-3.21%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC+3.88%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG+12.80%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-1.38%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+0.78%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD+0.82%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR+5.23%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000.

Title: Nvidia investors' call gives the chip giant a chance to tell backers why they're wrong about DeepSeek's impact

When Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, the chip giant will have the chance to tell investors why it thinks their intense reaction to the rise of DeepSeek was a mistake — or change the subject entirely. Heading into 2025, Nvidia's rule looked unassailable as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and others lined up for its chips. Then the Chinese startup DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model with benchmark results to rival OpenAI's o1 model. Critically, R1 was said to be produced with fewer and less powerful chips than o1. "DeepSeek's remarkable feat has shaken the industry's assumptions about how much capital or GPU chips a company needs to stay ahead of the competition," Barclays analysts wrote last month. Though Nvidia has largely recovered from markets' reaction to DeepSeek — the chip firm lost $600 billion in market capitalization in one day, in the biggest single drop in US market history — CEO Jensen Huang will need to show investors that the party is nowhere near over and that the promise of AI isn't overhyped. Huang previewed his argument at a virtual event broadcast Thursday, where he said investors had misinterpreted the signals of DeepSeek. As Nvidia prepares to address investors officially for the first time since the DeepSeek saga, here's what to look out for in its earnings. Analysts predict that Nvidia's revenue, especially in its all-important data center business, will keep rising — bolstered by coming data center buildouts. Nvidia's customers are still lining up. OpenAI's Stargate project is expected to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US. Meta has forecast an additional $65 billion in spending on data centers this year. And Amazon recently forecast spending $100 billion on computing power. It will offer Nvidia fresh evidence to present to investors concerned that DeepSeek's claim to use chips more efficiently — a key driver in lowering costs — would hurt demand. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed 'revolutionary' optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors in early February. Model improvements are another favorable piece of evidence for Nvidia. Grok 3, xAI's latest model, has received praise for its performance. Musk's firms also recently collaborated on a second data center with roughly 12,000 Nvidia GPUs, Business Insider exclusively reported. Musk has been aggressively adding to the fleet of GPU-packed data centers supporting Grok, suggesting a link between progress and infrastructure. Morgan Stanley analysts told investors in a note last week that model builders and hyperscalers still had their eyes on artificial general intelligence and that cheaper, highly functional models like DeepSeek wouldn't affect that pursuit. Nvidia's latest and most powerful chip series, Blackwell, has struggled with a slow rollout due to manufacturing and overheating issues. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to report a strong ramp-up. "Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters," Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, said in an investor note last week. UBS's Timothy Arcuri wrote that after much consternation, investor fears of a botched rollout were relaxing, and strong sales numbers could put them fully at ease. UBS analysts also said the fourth quarter was the last in which Blackwell chips wouldn't make up the majority of Nvidia's GPU sales. Investors are likely to favor that shift because Blackwell brings with it higher profit margins. Nvidia's buzzy GTC conference is set to take place in San Jose, California, next month, marking the first anniversary of Blackwell's debut. Further growth in inference demand would also be a point for Huang's theory of investor error surrounding the DeepSeek rout. Demand for inference, the process of using and improving models once they've been trained, increases when consumers and businesses find value in AI tools. Investors will likely want to see the share of AI workloads continue to shift to inference, which also requires GPUs to run. On the company's latest call, in November, Huang repeatedly said inference across Nvidia's platforms was growing. Growth in the software layers of Nvidia's tech stack would be a good sign, too. This would suggest maturity in AI products and lend strength to a part of its business that's potentially even more difficult to compete with than the chips themselves. "What Nvidia talks about on its long-term moats and its possible deployment on the AI application side probably matters more this time," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Investors will also be looking for any signals from Nvidia about the company's approach to China as President Donald Trump threatens to upend business relations with the country. Just before the end of his term, President Joe Biden initiated new regulations, now in a 120-day comment period, on the export of high-powered chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Many policy analysts expect Trump to allow the rules to take effect, as they align with his "America First" agenda, though Trump hasn't directly addressed them. Trump last month described AI leadership as critical to ensuring "economic and national security." Last month, Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, the home of Nvidia's chip manufacturing partner, TSMC. Tariffs could lead to increased costs for Nvidia. Huang met with the president at the White House last month, but neither party provided details of the discussion. Though Nvidia's share price has recovered much of its DeepSeek-induced losses, the $3 trillion juggernaut faces various headwinds. Huang's job on Wednesday will be to reassure investors that those headwinds will be mild and reaffirm that Nvidia remains fundamental to the AI story. Jump to

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

The company will likely continue to report robust demand for its products and a compelling outlook. The stock is likely to pop - per our data on how Nvidia reacts post earnings. However, there is a larger risk to the US economy, worth factoring right now. What is that? See more on Trefis.com Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia. When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table. NVDA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 3 economic downturns. Inflation Shock (Jan 2022 to May 2023) • NVDA stock fell 66% from a high of $33 on 19 November 2021 to $11 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-inflation shock peak by 25 May 2023 - taking 154 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 317 days • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and currently trades at around $135. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. • NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days. • During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%) and Micron (MU+1.00%) also gained. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.33%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+1.32%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.
