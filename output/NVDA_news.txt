Title: Apple leads Magnificent 7 stock drop amid Trump tariffs

Apple (AAPL-5.05%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-2.24%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-4.31%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-9.69%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-8.36%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stocks tumble after Trump's tariff reveal, with Dow set to shed 1,000 points

Markets plummeted Thursday in the wake of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%, with the damage extending to most industries on the prospects of stagflation — that is, slower economic growth accompanied by faster inflation. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 6%, making Thursday the market’s worst day for stocks in five years. Airlines, retailers and big banks took big hits, with some healthcare companies among the few gainers. For the Magnificent 7, declines were 9.3% for Apple (AAPL-5.05%), 9% for Amazon (AMZN-2.24%), 9% for Meta (META-4.31%), 5.5% for Tesla (TSLA-9.69%), 7.8% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%), 2.4% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%), and 3.9% for Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%). Big Tech will be vulnerable to retaliation by the European Union. “Trump’s tariff plan probably represents a shift for markets to quickly move from max uncertainty to max pessimism, although if countries retaliate — and Europe and China are talking like they will — rates could go up even further and drive another leg down for markets,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial (LPLA-9.48%). Buchbinder expects stocks to stabilize provided negotiations bear fruit and take tariff rates down, assuming markets are assured that no meaningful tariff rates will be increased because of retaliation, he wrote in an email distributed to the media. Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), isn’t so sanguine as she expects the levies to actually go into effect as announced. “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk,” she told Quartz on Wednesday after the news. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Trump showed no signs of backing down on Thursday, saying, “It’s going very well,” comparing the imposition of tariffs to surgery, and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. The president’s early claims that the import taxes will bring back jobs is debatable, and duties have a poor historical track record of boosting manufacturing employment. The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the EU will be slapped with 20%. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. The large tariffs on Asian countries will weigh heavily on shoe and apparel makers, which do much of their manufacturing in the region. Shares of Nike (NKE+3.70%) plunged 14%, while those of Lululemon (LULU+1.05%) plummeted 9.6%, and those of Uggs- and Hoka-maker Deckers (DECK+3.33%) tumbled 14%. Restoration Hardware’s parent RH (RH-4.04%) tumbled 40% on Thursday on a double whammy of earnings and tariffs. Williams-Sonoma (WSM+1.74%) plunged 16%, and at the other end of the retail spectrum Dollar Tree (DLTR+2.78%) fell 13%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. General Motors (GM-4.40%), Ford (F+0.10%) and Stellantis (STLA-5.63%) nonetheless extended their declines — by 4.3%, 5.9% and 9.4%, respectively — as Canada retaliated in kind for Trump’s new 25% tariffs on cars and trucks. “The tariff announcement was intended to give clarity on tariff policy,” Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University, said via an email sent to the media. “Unfortunately, it has created more questions and confusion.” Stellantis has already suspended plants in Canada and Mexico, he added. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free from China. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.65%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.5%. The the stock market — and the economy — isn’t certain to get help from the Federal Reserve in the form of an interest rate cut, given that the import taxes will probably both boost inflation and weigh on GDP growth. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will prioritize prices or full employment. Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million.The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by more than expected. Yardeni Research projected that PCED inflation will accelerate to 3% to 4% over the rest of this year, with the potential for a quick deterioration of the labor market. If stagflation sets in, the firm expects it to last six months to a year. “The worst-case scenario is a recession if high tariff rates stick, leading to a slowdown in business and consumer spending that cause layoffs,” the firm wrote in a QuickTakes note. “We raised our odds of a stagflation/recession scenario from 35% to 45% on Monday.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Investors weren’t happy with President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, sending stocks plunging. The S&P 500 fell 4% at 10:14 a.m., the Nasdaq composite declined 5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.7%, or 1,556 points. For the Magnificent 7, declines in pre-market trading were 7.5% for Apple (AAPL-5.05%), 6.3% for Amazon (AMZN-2.24%), 4.7% for Meta (META-4.31%), 6.1% for Tesla (TSLA-9.69%), 5.7% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%), 2.8% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%), and 3% for Google’s (GOOGL-1.86%) parent Alphabet. The import taxes will be applied on a country-by-country basis. Chinese goods, for example, will be hit with a 34% levy, while products from the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties. Mexican and Canadian goods won’t face any additional charges. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Melisa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), told Quartz. The tariffs are “not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million. The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by much more than expected for March to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, with the new orders measure dropping to 50.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. More stocks to watch today: Constellation Brands (STZ-2.34%), which makes, imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Revenue and per-share profit may have been little changed from a year earlier. The stock fell 0.6%. General Motors (GM-4.40%) stock dropped 3% after Trump confirmed that 25% duties on cars, trucks and autoparts will go into place as planned. Stellantis (STLA-5.63%) fell 5.1%, and Ford (F+0.10%) slid 2.7%. Trump had announced the auto tariffs earlier, and refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Nike’s (NKE+3.70%) stock plunged 13% because the shoemaker’s contract factories abroad in countries including Vietnam and China will face much higher tariffs. Apparel maker Lululemon (LULU+1.05%) and Deckers (DECK+3.33%) Outdoor, which makes the Hoka and Teva brands, fell 13% and 17%, respectively for the same reason. PDD (PDD-9.65%) stock fell 4.3%. The company’s Temu shopping website will be affected by the end of the de minimis exemption that allows low-value packages to be sent from China duty free.

Apple (AAPL) shares fell sharply, while Nvidia (NVDA) and other chip stocks also tumbled amid concerns about disruption to their supply chains.

It’s impossible to predict (time) what the market will do. By the time you see the information in the media the market players have already priced in the moves. We, the great unwashed, are too far down the information train to do anything effective. Having said that, we’re in a war with another one threatening. You could hardly do badly buying the military industrial complex. But Amazon and Visa have outperformed most of them. With only one exception I own only American companies because we have the most “honest” bookkeeping. Buy and only sell when you notice a long slow decline. That means the people running the company have taken their eye off the ball. Go to Yahoo finance and call up the long-term stock price chart. They generally trend into the same direction until they either double or crash and burn. Buy and sell accordingly. 13 posted on 04/03/2025 5:19:12 AM PDT by Gen.Blather (I had a tagline and I dropped it.

If you need the money in the next couple years, keep it in a money market fund. 4% is not too bad with minimal risk. For five years or more, it has always been best to invest in the stock market (i. e. our overall economy). For the longer period mentioned, dollar cost averaging in the S&P500 on the way down is the way to go. No one ever knows the bottom. I’ve done that for a long time, and it has been great. ETF’s are more tax efficient than mutual funds.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement
URL: https://qz.com/trump-tariffs-market-reaction-1851774378
Time Published: 2025-04-02T22:05:00Z
Full Content:
Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-5.05%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-2.24%), 3.7% for Meta (META-4.31%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-9.69%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%). Palantir (PLTR-10.86%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-4.40%) and Stellantis (STLA-5.63%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.65%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Stocks fell on “Liberation Day,” when President Donald Trump is set to unveil new tariffs on virtually all countries with which the U.S. has a trading relationship. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dropped about 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 116 points, or 0.3%. Tech shares were mainly lower ahead of the import-tax announcement. Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%) fell about 1.7% as of 10:12 a.m., Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%) dropped 0.7%, Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%) was down 0.5%, Apple (AAPL-5.05%) and Amazon (AMZN-2.24%) both declined about 0.4% and Meta (META-4.31%) was off 0.3%. Tesla (TSLA-9.69%) fell after quarterly sales fell short of expectations. Palantir (PLTR-10.86%) gained 1.3%. The long-awaited reciprocal tariffs will be “effective immediately” after Trump announces them starting at 4 p.m. EDT, the White House said Tuesday. On Monday, Trump told reporters that he’s settled on a tariff plan, but declined to reveal details. One option was a 20% duty on virtually all imports, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-4.97%) reported. The White House has downplayed the possibility that Trump will make an announcement on additional sectoral tariffs on Wednesday, saying that while the president is still committed to them, he’ll roll them out later. Employers added 155,000 jobs in March, more than expected, increasing from an upwardly revised 84,000 in February, the ADP (ADP-3.95%) survey showed. Factory orders gained 0.6% in February, better than the consensus estimate but slowing from an upwardly revised 1.8% in January. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. EDT on “Inflation expectations and monetary policymaking.” Some stocks to watch today: Newsmax stock plunged 41% after surging 179% yesterday to $233. The conservative cable news channel opened at $14 on Monday in its post-IPO trading debut. Tesla’s stock fell about 2.1% after Elon Musk’s EV-maker delivered about 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 13% decline from a year earlier and far below analysts expectations for 390,000. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory dropped 11.5% year-on-year in March to 78,828. Many rivals, except for Ford (F+0.10%), have reported solid sales ahead of planned U.S. auto tariffs.

Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Time Published: 2025-04-01T16:17:30Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC-9.67%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-7.70%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-7.45%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-7.52%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO-7.54%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-7.56%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.

Stock edged lower on Tuesday after economic indicators showed further softening ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as of 10:10 a.m, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%. The ISM manufacturing index fell by more than expected in March to 49.0 from 50.3 in February, with the new orders reading dropping to 45.2 from 48.6. A number under 50 indicates a contraction. The JOLTS job opening tally fell by more than expected in February, to 7.57 million. On the upside, construction spending rebounded by more than projected in February as weather improved. Investors are listening for any hints about Trump’s unveiling of import taxes. The announcement will focus on “country-based” duties, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, and while the president still plans sectoral tariffs, they won’t be the focus of Wednesday’s event. Trump said Sunday that he plans to start reciprocal tariffs with “all countries,” countering speculation he might limit the initial scope of his April 2 announcement, Bloomberg reported. Be on the lookout for hoaxes — it’s April Fools Day. Here are some stocks to watch today: CoreWeave rebounded, rising 2.3% following Monday’s 7.3% decline in its second day of trading after its underwhelming IPO. The tepid market reception may be a sign that hype over AI is subsiding. Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%) fell about 0.8%. Ford’s (F+0.10%) stock fell about 1.3% after it said that its first-quarter sales fell 1.3%. Sales of electric vehicles and hybrids gained 26% to a record. PVH’s stock surged 17% after the owner of the Calvin Klein (PVH+1.05%) and Tommy Hilfiger brands projected that sales would be flat to slightly higher this fiscal year compared with last. The consensus analyst forecast had been for a decline, according to FactSet. Tesla (TSLA-9.69%) shares gained 1% after declining 1.7% on Monday. The company’s first-quarter sales, due Wednesday, will probably disappoint investors, analysts said, with some trimming their forecasts to below 400,000 units. Xiaomi’s (XIACF-9.66%) ADRs plunged 7.4% after the Chinese EV maker confirmed reports that one of its SU7 models had been involved in a crash on an expressway in China, Bloomberg reported. Local media said that three people died in the accident. XPeng’s (XPEV-8.24%) U.S.-traded shares gained 1.1% after the Chinese EV-maker said its deliveries surged 268% in March from a year earlier to 33,205 units. Quarterly sales jumped 331%.

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?
URL: https://qz.com/coreweave-ipo-ai-bubble-1851773579
Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:29:00Z
Full Content:
New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH-3.65%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA-7.70%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT-2.62%) and Meta (META-4.51%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

CoreWeave's life as a publicly traded company is off to a rough start. The Nvidia-backed (NVDA) cloud-computing company managed to finish Friday, its first day of trading, in line with its IPO price and up from where it opened the session. On Monday morning, though, CoreWeave (CRWV) stock was pulled lower as markets slid. Shares of CoreWeave were recently down about 9% to under $37, below the $39 at which it opened trading last week. Part of the pullback is likely due to broader market concern, with investors jittery about what might happen later this week with the Trump administration tariff policy. That unease has lately weighed on tech shares, among them those associated with artificial intelligence, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the major indexes lower in recent trading today. The company in its IPO sold fewer shares, and at a lower price, than it originally hoped. One backer: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), which on Friday said it had acquired more than 400,000 shares. “There’s a lot of headwinds in the macro. There are headwinds in the AI trade," CEO Mike Intrator said on CNBC Friday. "We definitely had to scale, or right-size, the transaction for where the buy interest was.”

The market’s highest-performing tech stocks, the Magnificent 7, mostly slid on Monday amid worries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Tesla (TSLA-9.69%) was down 4.8% at 11:30 a.m., while Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%) was off 4.1%, Amazon (AMZN-2.24%) was 3% lower, Meta (META-4.31%) fell 2.1% Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%) dropped 2.5%, and Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%) was down by 1.1%. Apple (AAPL-5.05%) stock was the outlier among the Mag 7, rising 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes fell 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed earlier losses to rise about 88 points, or 0.2%. The Trump administration is expected to announce new tariffs on Wednesday that could include his so-called reciprocal tariff plan. The White House is currently debating over implementing individualized tariffs on trading partners, or an across-the-board tariff impacting all U.S. trade, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-4.97%) reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The president reportedly wants more aggression on tariffs, and has asked his team for plans to impose higher rates of tariffs on more countries, according to the Wall Street Journal. One plan reportedly involves tariffs of up to 20% on mostly all of the country’s trading partners. Trump has also reportedly pushed for import taxes on goods from countries that the U.S. has a trade deficit with. The Trump administration may also introduce industry-specific tariffs, including those that would impact critical minerals and related products, on Wednesday, but that’s not yet certain. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS-7.30%) economists bumped their forecast of the odds of a recession over the next 12 months to 35% from 20%. The increase “reflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies,” the economists wrote in a note.

Title: Bitcoin nears overbought zone – Why the risk of more losses remains high

Bitcoin faces uncertain market conditions, approaching oversold levels and volatility, with potential opportunities for long-term investors. The “Liberation Day” that U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed is approaching. Heading into the week, U.S. tech stocks saw losses in the overnight trading, with Tesla [TSLA] and Nvidia [NVDA] posting 5% and 3% losses, respectively. The Kobeissi Letter noted that the economic policy uncertainty reached the highest it has since 2020, with the 2nd of April being the date to watch. Moreover, the U.S. jobs report will arrive on the 4th of April, which could also influence market sentiment outside of the tariff news. Gold ETFs saw massive capital inflows, likely a direct consequence of the growing economic uncertainty. This has also put Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto sphere on the back foot, as they are risk-on assets. AMBCrypto delved into on-chain metrics to understand if BTC can stabilize around the March lows at $78k or if investors should expect more losses. Source: Checkonchain The short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Bands chart showed that the oscillator was in oversold conditions in late February and early March. Also, the price of Bitcoin was below the cost-basis of short-term holders. This is calculated using the realized price of coins moved within the last 155 days. The price of BTC had been “heated up” in November and December but has cooled off significantly since then. Bitcoin was likely to move below the oversold level, which stood at $78.95k at press time. Source: Checkonchain The Mayer multiple serves as a key metric for determining whether Bitcoin is fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued based on historical trends. Analysts calculate it by dividing Bitcoin’s market price by its 200-day Moving Average (MA). At press time, the Mayer multiple stood at 0.96. Two weeks ago, BTC fell below its 200DMA and has traded just below this level for most of this time. It stood at $85.92k at press time. The last time the price fell below the 200 DMA was August 2024. The price stayed below this MA for almost two months back then. A similar scenario could unfold now. Investors looking to buy BTC cheap should keep an eye on the 0.8 Mayer multiple, which represented the $68.74k level. Bitcoin would be considered “cheap” around this price level. In conclusion, long-term investors need to hunker down and weather the economic storm of the coming weeks and months. Once the sentiment across the market begins to shift, the trend might shift bullishly. Until then, they can Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into BTC or wait for nasty price drops from giant liquidation events to grab more BTC.

Stocks fell on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump has pushed his team to be more aggressive on tariffs in recent days. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6% as of 9:54 a.m. EDT. Shares of the Magnificent 7 mostly extended their declines. The losses were 6.4% for Tesla (TSLA-9.69%), 5% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.56%), 4% for Amazon (AMZN-2.24%), 3.4% for Meta (META-4.31%), 2.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.43%), and 2.2% for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.86%). Apple (AAPL-5.05%) was little changed. Automakers were mixed, with Stellantis (STLA-5.63%) dropping 1.9%, General Motors (GM-4.40%) off just 0.2% and Ford (F+0.10%) gaining 0.6%. Advisers have considered instituting tariffs of up to 20% on almost all U.S. trading partners, the Journal said, adding that Trump has pushed to levy import taxes on goods from all countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. The possibility of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs remains on the table, it added. He’s due to make a major announcement on tariffs on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (GS-7.30%) economists increased their forecast odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 20% to 35%. The Chicago Business Barometer PMI for March unexpectedly increased to 47.6 from 45.5 in February. The consensus estimate had been for 44.1. A reading under 50 indicates contraction. Here are some stocks to watch today. The Bank of China’s (BACHY-4.07%) ADRs jumped 7.8% after the lender disclosed a planned sale of new shares to Chinese government entities to boost Tier 1 equity capital. China Construction Bank (CICHY-3.51%), the Bank of Communications (BCMXY0.00%), and the Postal Savings Bank of China also disclosed similar stock sales. Coinbase (COIN-7.79%) slid 4% as Bitcoin declined, the WSJ reported. Other crypto-sensitive shares fell, including Robinhood (HOOD-10.85%), by 5.1%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR-0.79%), by 4.6%. Moderna (MRNA-1.83%) stock plunged 12% after the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, resigned and told the acting commissioner that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is seeking subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” according to the Associated Press. U.S. Bancorp (USB-6.21%) Vice Chair Terry Dolan, the lender’s chief administration officer, may have died on Sunday afternoon after the plane he was believed to be piloting crashed near Minneapolis. The stock fell about 0.7%. Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav has started meeting candidates who could replace film studio heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. The talks are early and no final decision has been made on the two executives’ futures. The stock fell 1.% Monday morning.

Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower and S&P 500 futures are down 1.1% after the indexes closed in negative territory Friday for the fifth time in the past six weeks. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.7% lower after also declining last week. Gold futures are jumping to trade at about $3,150 an ounce. Oil futures are edging higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling below 4.2%. Investors are awaiting updates on tariffs after reports that the Trump administration could expand proposals to include a 20% across-the-board import tax on all U.S. trading partners, according to The Wall Street Journal . The report comes ahead of Wednesday's expected announcement on "reciprocal" tariffs in response to import taxes on U.S.-made goods. Trump told NBC News over the weekend that he "couldn't care less" if proposed automobile tariffs raise prices, arguing it would help promote U.S. car manufacturing. Shares of "Big Three" automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), as well as Tesla (TSLA), are lower in premarket trading. Goldman Sachs economists raised their forecast for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts to three this year and increased their probability of a U.S. recession to 35% from 20%, as President Trump's tariffs put pressure on economic growth. Goldman now sees "core" inflation rising at an annual rate of 3.5% to end 2025, GDP growth slipping to 1%, and U.S. unemployment increasing to 4.5%. "We continue to believe the risk from April 2 tariffs is greater than many market participants have previously assumed," they wrote. Shares of cryptocurrency-related stocks are falling in premarket trading as the price of bitcoin (BTCUSD) trades below $84,000. Bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) stock is down 4% after sinking 10% Friday. Shares of bitcoin mining firms MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN), and trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) also are down after posting sharp losses Friday. Shares of cloud computing firm CoreWeave (CRWV) are more than 4% lower in premarket trading after ending flat at their IPO price of $40 per share in their first day of trading. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave is backed by artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), whose shares are also lower by more than 4% in early trading.

CoinShares' Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining (WGMI) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the worst-performing ETF of 2025, down 43% year-to-date, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETF is made up of several publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miners. IREN (IREN) is the largest holding at 15%, which is down 42%. Core Scientific (CORZ) follows with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, is down 52%. Even NVIDIA (NVDA), the sixth-largest holding at 5%, has dropped over 20% this year. According to its investment strategy, "The ETF will invest in companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from bitcoin mining operations and/or from providing specialized chips, hardware, software, or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining." WGMI consists of 21 holdings and manages $147.2 million in total assets. In contrast, metals ETFs have been the top performers of 2025, according to justETF. Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date. Bitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate—representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin—continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin’s price and the hash rate. As a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.

Title: Nvidia Hit Hard By China?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. NVDA Stock Nvidia stock has fallen around 5% in the past week and is currently down nearly 12% over the last month. So, what has triggered the recent sell-off in Nvidia shares? Nvidia is facing mixed developments in China. According to the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission has introduced new energy-efficiency standards for advanced chips used in data centers. These new regulations could effectively prevent Nvidia’s H20 chip from being used by Chinese firms expanding or building new data centers. The H20 is Nvidia’s leading chip tailored for China, featuring scaled-back capabilities to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Compared to Nvidia’s top-tier Blackwell processors available elsewhere, the H20 is less advanced. Resellers operating in the gray market have reportedly been using entities registered outside of China to acquire Nvidia’s newest chips, including the Blackwell GPUs—which are prohibited from being sold to Chinese customers—via companies based in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Recently, Singapore charged three individuals in connection with a fraud case involving the suspected resale of Nvidia chips through Malaysia to China. Under pressure from the U.S., Malaysia is now working with both the U.S. and Singapore to monitor the distribution of Nvidia’s high-end chips and to strengthen semiconductor regulations. These concerns are particularly noteworthy, as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, contributing approximately $23 billion in revenue for FY’25 (ended January 26), accounting for 18% of total sales—an increase from $2.3 billion, or about 8% of revenue, in FY’23. In contrast, China officially made up 13% of revenue in FY’25. Increased regulatory attention on these transactions could have implications for Nvidia stock. There is increasing skepticism about the sustainability of the current AI spending surge. Evidence suggests that the massive capital allocation by major U.S. tech companies could begin to taper. In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI model that operates at a significantly lower cost than those of most Western competitors. This development could encourage companies to shift away from hardware-heavy strategies and focus on more efficient solutions. Moreover, returns from AI investments have been underwhelming so far, causing concern among investors—particularly if the U.S. economy weakens. With inflation expected to rise again and economic growth potentially slowing under new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, market apprehensions are growing. Reports this week noted that Microsoft canceled several data center projects across the U.S. and Europe in the last six months, citing demand not matching supply. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s Chairman Joe Tsai also recently warned of a potential bubble in AI and data center investments. The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump? We currently value Nvidia stock at around $101 per share, which is roughly 10% below its current market price of $112. See our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons behind our slightly bearish view on the stock right now. One is the potential decline in the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI rally seen over the past two years, due to diminishing performance returns from increasingly large models and challenges in accessing high-quality training data. A transition toward more efficient AI models could amplify headwinds for GPU producers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia may encounter increased competition from companies such as AMD and even some of its own customers like Amazon, which are developing and deploying proprietary AI chips. While Nvidia benefits from a strong software ecosystem that complements its AI hardware—helping retain customers—it may still face pressures. At its current premium valuation, the stock might not fully account for these risks.

Title: Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.
