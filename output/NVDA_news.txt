This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software."

Title: Microsoft says it’s found the missing piece in quantum’s puzzle

Microsoft (MSFT-0.66%) is changing what you learned about the states of matter in elementary school with a creation that it said will advance “the path to useful quantum computing.” As part of what it calls the “year to become Quantum-Ready,” the company unveiled its first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, built with “topological superconductors” or “topoconductors” — a “breakthrough” material that enabled the company to create a new state of matter called “topological superconductivity.” Quantum computers typically use quantum bits — or qubits — which are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle. Connected together, qubits have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s that classical computers use. Unlike classical binary bits, qubits can be 0 and 1 at the same time in a state called superposition. The more qubits that are used, however, the more errors usually occur in a computation. Microsoft claims its solution to reducing those errors lies in the topoconductors. Unlike familiar solids, liquids, and gases, this new state of matter occurs when electrons pair up and flow with zero resistance while being protected by special mathematical properties that make them extremely stable. The new state of matter, which Microsoft has worked on for almost two decades, makes it possible for quantum systems to scale to one million qubits on a single, hand-sized chip, the company said, adding that it has demonstrated the world’s first topological qubit and already placed eight on Majorana 1. At one million qubits, a quantum computer could perform far more difficult calculations than traditional computers with higher accuracy. “[Q]uantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery,” Chetan Nayak, corporate vice president of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said in a statement. “What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.” Because these specially protected qubits are smaller, faster, and more reliable than traditional qubits, Microsoft said it could build a working prototype of an error-free quantum computer in just years rather than decades. The company calls this a “fault-tolerant prototype” or FTP. “Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella wrote on X. “This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.” Despite the excitement, Microsoft customers won’t be able to use the Majorana 1 chip through its Azure public cloud, CNBC (CMCSA+0.11%) reported, as Microsoft continues its research with national laboratories and universities. Quantum computing stocks climbed off of the announcement, with D-Wave Quantum (QBTS+3.59%) shares jumping more than 8%, Quantum Computing (QUBT-0.87%) rising 7.8%, and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-3.88%) shares up almost 5%. Earlier this year, quantum stocks plunged after both Nvidia (NVDA-0.69%) chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META-0.48%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts about the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.44%) continued its strong rally a week after reporting impressive earnings, even as U.S. stocks remained relatively stable overall on Tuesday following the long weekend. Shares of the AI hardware company surged 13% on Tuesday, trading at $53 a piece. The sustained momentum comes as Super Micro’s latest earnings report reassured investors about its delayed annual filing and outlined an ambitious growth target for 2026. Super Micro is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang seemed confident that it would be submitted on time. Since last week, investors have been bullish about SMCI’s performance. In its earnings report, the company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. Last week, banking giant JPMorgan (JPM+0.79%) analysts raised the SMCI stock price target to $35 from $23 while keeping an ‘underweight’ rating. SMCI stock has risen 80% year-to-date. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Jose-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.69%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

Nvidia (NVDA-0.69%) stock extended its rally into a third day, rising more than 1% on Tuesday. The AI chipmaker’s shares have now regained about 90% of the ground they lost in panic-selling last month triggered by Chinese startup DeepSeek. At about $140 per share, Nvidia stock is still below its 2025 peak of $153.13, set on Jan. 7. Despite DeepSeek’s claims of lower costs to develop AI, new spending plans have since been unveiled worldwide, MarketWatch (NWSA-0.54%) reports, citing Bank of America Securities (BAC+0.40%) analyst Vivek Arya. These include a European Commission plan to mobilize €200 billion for investment, including a €20 billion fund for AI gigafactories. South Korea will buy 10,000 high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) this year, including Nvidia’s H100 and H200 models, to accelerate the launch of a national AI computing center, Yonhap reported Monday, citing Acting President Choi Sang-mok. And given strong demand, pricing for Nvidia’s existing chips may remain resilient despite the company’s transition to its new Blackwell technology, Barron’s reports, citing a note from UBS (UBS+0.64%) analyst Timothy Arcuri. Nvidia stock fell by more than 17% in just one trading day in January amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. The selloff was so pronounced that Nvidia did unusual damage control. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” a company spokesperson said in a statement at the time. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Nvidia stock has cleared a big hurdle ahead of its hotly anticipated earnings next week

Nvidia stock cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday as it recovered the losses sparked by the $589 billion DeepSeek sell-off in late January. At its intraday high of $143.44, Nvidia was trading above its January 24 close of $142.62, the trading session before the GPU maker experienced the biggest one-day market value decline in history. The stock has since pared its gains on Tuesday to about 1%, trading at $140.34. Nvidia shares have been on a tear so far in February, rising about 22%. The rally has boosted the stock above several closely watched technical trading levels, including its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, as represented by the red and blue lines in the chart below. David Keller, Chief Strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, recently told Business Insider that he was watching $130 as a key line in the sand for Nvidia shares, another hurdle it recently cleared. The head of technical research at Oppenheimer & Co., Ari Wald, told BI that $140 is the key resistance level to monitor. With the DeepSeek losses mostly recovered and the technical resistance levels cleared, investors are eagerly anticipating Nvidia's earnings results next week. "The next important test for AI bulls comes on Feb-26 when NVDA reports FQ4 results," Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a Tuesday note. Arya warned that Nvidia's stock price could be volatile after the earnings results, likely due to a potentially subdued first-quarter outlook driven by the transition to Blackwell GPUs. However, the long-term fundamentals should remain intact. "We expect positive momentum to resume as investors look forward to NVDA's leading new product pipeline (GB300, Rubin) and TAM expansion into robotics and quantum technologies at upcoming GTC conference (Mar-17)," Arya said. Even after Nvidia's 20%+ rally this month, Arya argued that the stock's valuation remains "compelling" with a 24x price-to-earnings ratio based on 2026 estimates. That's at the lower end of its historical range of 25x to 56x, according to the bank. For its part, Super Micro Computer, which sells server racks integrated with Nvidia's GPUs, said on its earnings call last week that it expects to see an inflection in its revenue thanks to the rollout of Blackwell. "Highlighted by the beginning of our transition from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, we expect the growth in new generation platforms to accelerate as supply ramps this quarter and beyond," Super Micro Computer's CEO and founder, Charles Liang, said Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Intel stock pops 5% because TSMC and Broadcom both might buy a piece of it

Intel (INTC-2.55%) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business. One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM+0.14%) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. Broadcom (AVGO-1.96%) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet. Qualcomm (QCOM-3.39%) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year. The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.69%) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia. Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The technology PR landscape has shifted dramatically since 2020, with artificial intelligence, data analytics and digital channels reshaping how companies communicate their innovations. Major tech firms like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) now regularly face intense public scrutiny over their A.I. developments, while companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) navigate complex regulatory environments across global markets. PR professionals must master new tools and strategies to manage these challenges effectively. The intersection of technology and communication demands a sophisticated approach that combines traditional PR principles with advanced digital capabilities. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. PR teams at leading tech companies now use A.I. tools to analyze media sentiment, predict emerging trends and create targeted content. For example, Microsoft‘s communications team employs natural language processing to monitor social media conversations in real-time, allowing them to respond rapidly to potential issues before they escalate. Similarly, IBM‘s PR department uses A.I.-driven analytics to identify the most effective times and channels for press releases, resulting in increased media pickup rates. The numbers tell a compelling story: According to Cision’s 2023 State of the Media Report, 78 percent of PR professionals now use A.I. tools for at least one aspect of their work. These tools range from Synthesio’s AI-powered social listening platform to PressPage’s automated media monitoring systems. Modern tech PR requires a solid foundation in data analytics. For example, when Nvidia wanted to showcase its role in advancing A.I. technology in the digital and physical worlds, its PR strategy underscored Nvidia (NVDA)’s role in the A.I. ecosystem and how its A.I. models transform industries like robotics, climate science and healthcare. A similar data-driven PR push can enhance A.I. workflows across all sectors. Key components of successful data-driven PR include: Tech ethics has become a central concern for PR professionals. For instance, when ChatGPT faced criticism over bias in its responses, OpenAI‘s communications team implemented a transparent approach to addressing these concerns. They published detailed blog posts explaining their methodology and hosted public forums with A.I. ethics experts. Successful tech ethics communication strategies often include: Tech companies often face unique crisis scenarios, from data breaches to A.I. mishaps that require well-thought-out crisis management strategies. As proof of this, LastPass experienced a security breach in 2022, and their PR team executed a response plan. This plan included an immediate notification to affected users, regular updates on the investigation progress, technical briefings for security journalists and a comprehensive remediation roadmap. This approach helped maintain customer trust and quell anxiety around the incident. Digital channels now dominate tech PR strategies. For example, AMD’s launch of its Ryzen processors included partnerships with tech influencers who reached over 50 million viewers combined. The campaign generated millions of engagements across social platforms and contributed to a 23 percent increase in market share. Effective digital strategies typically incorporate the following: Modern tech PR requires sophisticated measurement approaches. To illustrate this, Muck Rack compiled a list of metrics PR pros should measure: share-of-voice, stories placed, advertising-value-equivalency, reach/impressions, sentiment, key message pull-through, website traffic and social engagement. In fact, according to The State of PR report from Muck Rack, 66% of PR pros say producing measurable results is the best way to increase the value of PR to key stakeholders. Key developments in the tech PR space may come to fruition in the next few months. For example, quantum computing will create new communication challenges to address, while we may see AR/VR become the primary channel for press events. A.I. will likely automate 50 percent of routine PR tasks, and blockchain will verify press release authenticity. The technology PR landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Success requires a combination of traditional PR expertise and mastery of new tools and techniques. PR professionals who stay ahead of these trends while maintaining a focus on clear, authentic communication will lead the industry forward. To succeed in this environment, start by auditing your current tech stack, investing in AI-powered tools, and developing a data-driven strategy that aligns with your company’s technical expertise and ethical standards. Ronn Torossian is the Founder & Chairman of 5W Public Relations, one of the largest independently-owned PR firms in the United States. Since founding 5WPR in 2003, he has led the company’s growth and vision, with the agency earning accolades including being named a Top 50 Global PR Agency by PRovoke Media, a top three NYC PR agency by O’Dwyers, one of Inc.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/16/2025 3:32:47 PM PST by SunkenCiv Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are reportedly weighing plans to bid for Intel that would result in the storied chipmaker breaking up.According to The Wall Street Journal in a report Saturday, Broadcom has been looking into Intel’s chip-design and marketing business and and has “informally discussed” a bid with its advisers if it finds a partner for Intel’s chip-making operations.The report said TSMC has examined taking over some or all of Intel’s chip plants, meanwhile, as part of an investor consortium or another structure. (Excerpt) Read more at investopedia.com ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHat_LYrpQE Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt? There’s no way this should have happened with competent leadership. Let me gues - they went and got politically woke with the business. Yes, woke, and lacking any vision. They got complacent at the top and favored screwing over customers instead of innovating. Competition caught up and now they have to deal with their inferior products, quality control, and some unforgiving customers. “to actually be going bankrupt? “ They have $22 billion in cash ... That’s the gist of how o remember it too. I used to work across the street from their fab outside of Sacramento and had a few friends working there. This is huge. I’m not in this business anymore but it looks to me like this represents a sea change from the personal microprocessor to the server-level AI/cloud. I hope not. I want all my computing to belong to me, including the damned software. I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management. Numerous White engineers laid off to pay exec salaries. Expect other tech companies to follow the same trajectory. Top 7 Things Linux Does Better than Windows ExplainingComputers (YT channel) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSd7wD-2x4 The second big problem is a 15GB outlook.pst file that I have failed to convert to Thunderbird. I may have to run Windows as a virtual machine, but if I do that, I'll have to make sure I can get that data to work. Believe me: I want out of Microsoft. Bfl Hope this helps. https://superuser.com/questions/19555/can-i-access-microsoft-outlook-pst-archives-with-any-other-tools linux - Can I access Microsoft Outlook PST archives with any other ... Top answer All answers (5) The .PST file is a proprietary format, and AFAIK, can only be used by Microsoft products. There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux. Answer from chills42 on superuser.com https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php Thanks, I'll take a look. I purchased a software product specifically dedicated to that end. It failed to generate a usable output, I think because of the file size. I have parted out portions of the Outlook.pst to archive files to run through that app, but haven't done it yet.

Consumer inflation (CPI) was higher than expected in January. One of the culprits was airfare, with ... [+] used car prices and auto insurance premiums adding to the rise. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) Earnings season is nearing the finish line, with over three-quarters of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete. The pace of earnings releases eases to 45 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Only one of the Magnificent 7, Nvidia (NVDA), is left to release earnings on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose 1.5% for the week, with the Magnificent 7 outperforming with a 2.1% gain. Markets were pleasantly surprised with President Donald Trump’s announcement that ordered a study of reciprocal tariffs rather than an immediate implementation. Market Returns According to FactSet data, multiple sectors drove the improvement in the earnings growth rate for the week. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Expected sales growth was unchanged for the week at 5.2% but exceeding expectations at the start of earnings season, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 4Q 2024 Sales Estimates By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.9% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Consumer Price Index inflation came in hot for January, rising to a 3% year-over-year rate. Used cars, airfares, and auto insurance premiums were a large part of the story behind the numbers. Inflation has recently accelerated, with the three-month annualized rate at 4.9%. Help from some of the volatile components and housing inflation should help it ease somewhat from here. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI Despite an ugly month-over-month gain for services inflation, excluding housing, the year-over-year rate declined to 4%. If services inflation continues to improve, markets and the Federal Reserve will rest easier about inflation fears. Services Inflation While December retail sales were revised higher, January data exhibited evidence of a broad-based spending hangover from the robust spending data at the end of last year. In addition, natural disasters may have weighed on spending. As long as U.S. employment continues to rise, consumer spending should snap back. Consumer Spending & Jobs Sluggish consumer spending caused the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to 2.3%. This is nowhere near recessionary levels, but it is down from the robust growth estimate of 2.9% before the retail sales release. On a more positive note, the easing in economic growth estimates helped bring 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields down from higher levels following the hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Without as much meaningful economic data this week and most of it impacted by natural disasters, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday could provide some clues to the timing of the next rate cut. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until at least mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts Earnings season continues during the holiday-shortened week, but the pace of releases has begun to slow. Given Trump’s feverish pace of policy announcements, markets will continue to be on guard, although market participants seem to be adapting to the new administration as is typical. The highlight of the week should be Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings and Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter on Saturday. This follows the release of the details of Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded stock portfolio last Friday. Buffett seems to have continued to reduce Berkshire’s allocation to stocks, but he added one new company to its stable of holdings.
