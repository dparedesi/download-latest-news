Chip stocks were among the market leaders on Wednesday thanks to President Donald Trump’s statement the day before that tariffs on China “will come down substantially,” as well as vote of confidence by famed investor Cathie Wood. Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought up stock in several chipmakers on Tuesday, including $1.1 million shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). On Wednesday, Nvidia jumped more than 5%, approaching its 21-day moving average. Palintir Technologies (PLTR+6.03%) also had a strong performance Wednesday, rising more than 7%, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.90%) shot up by 10.2% during the day, AMD (AMD+2.02%) rose 8.1%, Micron (MU+2.76%) jumped 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO-1.52%) more than 7%. Although semiconductors and other electronics are currently exempt from steep U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, administration officials have said those exemptions are temporary, and tariffs would probably be imposed on the sector in a month or two. Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

Title: Nvidia investors should watch out for this key risk that could trigger a double-digit semiconductor stock plunge in the next 12 months

It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year. If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan. In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%. While most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released. "President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing," Papic and Gertken wrote. "That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade." Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy. Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers," Yardeni wrote in a note last week. "President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy." BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months. Taiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies. In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed "WWIII," expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. "Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification," Papic and Gertken wrote. In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500. Investors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe. "Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event," wrote Papic and Gertken. "For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices." As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said. "Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap," they wrote. Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU). Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

As Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) prepares to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings after the bell Tuesday, investors are watching closely for updates on two long-delayed projects: the company’s affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi platform. The two initiatives once were expected to define Tesla’s next chapter — but concerns about CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements are clouding the outlook. Analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk’s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand. Tesla’s stock has plunged 40% year-to-date, impacted by falling deliveries, fierce competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD (BYDDY+2.70%), and political headwinds. But there’s one group of investors that’s thriving: short sellers. According to S3 Partners, traders betting against Tesla have made an estimated $11.5 billion in profits so far this year — making it the most profitable short globally, surpassing Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). Short interest has climbed 15% as bearish sentiment builds. Public perception is also shifting. A recent CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand’s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce. But with investor nerves fraying, Tesla’s Q1 report could be a decisive moment in the company’s 2025 story — for bulls and bears alike.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/22/2025 7:51:17 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Now that Pat Gelsinger is no longer occupying the corner office at embattled chipmaker Intel (INTC), he can acknowledge one thing about the semiconductor industry.Nvidia (NVDA) has a wide, wide lead over its rivals on the tech front..."They have built meaningful moats around their franchise," he added.Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around Intel for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).He was fired in early December amid missed financial targets, lack of progress on the AI chip front, and a cash drain on the foundry business.Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.Analysts think Nvidia may post upward of $5 per share in earnings in 2025. Nvidia's stock is up 1,220% over the past five years, while Intel's has dropped 69%.Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO in March.Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with Gelsinger over how to position the business.Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel...Tan will get to outline his strategy publicly -- and detail how he will navigate Trump tariffs -- when the company announces first quarter results on April 24 after the market close.

Intel Agencies Caught in Massive Voter Fraud USAWatchdog.com ^ | 4FEB2025 | Greg Hunter Posted on 2/5/2025, 10:19:32 AM by Tom Tetroxide Dr. Jerome Corsi has a Harvard PhD in political science. He has written more than 30 books with many of them becoming best-sellers. Dr. Corsi’s latest project is about voter fraud. Corsi says he can prove Donald Trump really did win in 2020. There were also countless down-ballot thefts in 2020 and in 2024. Dr. Corsi and others have uncovered a grand scam that dates back to the early 2000’s that has cheated people into office that actually lost. The architects of the steal can be traced back to U.S. intel agencies. Dr. Corsi created a website for this project called GodsFiveStones.com and explains, “GodsFiveStones.com is named after the David and Goliath Bible story. This is when David picks up five smooth stones from the brook, and they are the exact ones needed to kill Goliath. That’s what we are aiming to do is to kill this Goliath of voter fraud.” The voter fraud is hidden in the voter rolls that every state government maintains. Corsi says, “You look at state records, and there might be 12 million records and there might be 2 million false records. They look legitimate until you really analyze them, and then you realize they are duplicates or clones. If you send out people to canvas them, there is nobody there. They are falsified and hidden in the data base. It’s like a card marking scheme. . . . They did not use the algorithms in the 2024 Election for President because we were on the lookout for it. The down-ballot elections (House, Governor and Senate) used these algorithms, and they cheated.” Corsi estimates they cheated 20 House Democrats and 5 Democrat Senators into office in 2024. snip I recommend “The nVidia Way” book. It’s an interesting read, much of the success is around their culture. Jensen just outworks everyone, requiring it of everyone. They behave as though the next breakthrough in tech will kill the company, so be first and never get complacent. That said, it seems he sacrifices his life to just work. I was in a company bought by Intel. They were constantly distracted by different ideas. They seemed to have no focus. They also didn’t listen, there was a certain arrogance about the Intel employees. They’re way behind in AI hardware and software. It’s not just the hardware. The CUDA software opened doors into unanticipated markets. That said, from a stock point of view, imho...they’re going to enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ on the Gartner Hype Cycle. The possibilities hit regulatory aspects. The recent market performance may be reflecting this but it’s hard to see due to the other volatility (e.g. tariffs). Long term buy, looking for another dip - over 30% down since start of the year. I used to work for Intel, but I was in and out before Pat came to power. But a good friend who worked there for a LONG time used to work for Pat and says that he’s a very smart engineer, and he thought the right person for the job as CEO. When things didn’t go so well under his leadership my friend said he believed the issue was that Pat was an engineer, and that the board of directors (who make all the decisions ANYWAY), didn’t WANT an engineer to lead the company, they wanted more of a finance guy. So here we are. A different world but when I was supporting government development projects the two big leaders would be Program Manager (focusing on Cost and Schedule) and Chief Engineer (focusing on technical requirements). I never worked with a Chief Engineer who gave a fig about technical requirements. The Chief Engineers always focused on Cost and Schedule. Always the money. Never the engineering. I know a bunch of former Intel people who now work at AMD they say Intel is in a death spiral and while AMD needs to spend and upgrade their Server lab spaces they are poised to kick some Intel ass. The only thing the new CEO brings is customer feedback on fabless design needs. True something very missing from Intel but it might not be enough. DEI has destroyed the inner workings of Intel started by Obama. It has not been the same place since Paul Otellini retired. Intel had a long track record of forcing out experienced people and replacing them with Indian workers. Those experienced engineers went to AMD, Nvidia, Apple and IBM. I went to IBM where for the first time after 30 years, felt like I was being treated like a professional. You were just a number at Intel.

Title: What’s the current news with all of the magnificent seven stocks
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/04/21/whats-the-current-news-with-all-of-the-magnificent-seven-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:15:31Z
Full Content:
Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

Title: What’s So Special About Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Trading Activities?

One of the most interesting investors over the past few years isn’t some hedge fund manager or Wall St veteran, it’s congressional representative Nancy Pelosi. Her investing disclosures include early bets on Nvidia and Tempus AI before both companies had a massive run-up in valuation, along with many other profitable trades. While insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of congress, many people believe that she could be using confidential information from her insights into laws before they’re made public. That doesn’t mean that people can’t also benefit from her trades, however. How are people taking advantage? While the obvious best-case-scenario would be for this kind of political trading to be banned, one company decided that regular people should be able to get similar exposure to her trades. That’s where Dub, and their affiliate Dub Advisors comes in. They’ve built an app that has access to a model portfolio that tracks her trading strategies and automatically rebalances whenever her moves are publicly announced. Since their $PELOSI portfolio launched on September 27, 2023, it’s returned 77.34% as of April 1, 2025. Why follow politician trades? Politicians may have access to information or insights that are not readily available to the public. For example, they may have insights into how upcoming legislation or regulations will impact specific industries and companies. In some cases, they might even anticipate global events through sensitive briefings or influence a company’s prospects through their legislative power. Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio aims to capitalize on these potential information advantages by purchasing stocks that Pelosi has bought. How is the $PELOSI portfolio constructed? Dub Advisors built the $PELOSI portfolio using public financial disclosures required by the STOCK Act. These disclosures provide information about securities transactions made by members of Congress and other senior government officials. While the portfolio is constructed from these disclosures, it isn’t an exact replica of Pelosi’s investments. Due to reporting and technical limitations, that’s not feasible. Instead, they apply proprietary techniques used by hedge funds to design a portfolio with the most potential to outperform the market. Their strategy for creating politician portfolios focuses on two key factors: While their exact methods are proprietary, some concrete ways that Dub Advisors find stocks with high conviction and information asymmetry are: While past performance does not guarantee future results, PELOSI’s excellent performance thus far has boosted their confidence in this methodology. Doesn’t the 45-day reporting delay hurt returns? Politicians have 45 days to report their stock transactions, meaning that we find out about their trades well after they happen. While it would be ideal to know about trades instantly, the 45-day reporting lag does not render their strategy ineffective. Most politicians buy and hold for long periods of time. For example, Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio has continuously held a position in NVDA since inception in September 2023, so a 45 day delay doesn’t affect overall performance much. Moreover, politicians often report trades well before the 45-day limit since there is no benefit to delaying. For example, Pelosi’s most recent buy of NVDA occurred on July 25, 2024, and was reported on July 31, 2024. How to invest in the $PELOSI portfolio Want to invest?

Title: Nvidia stock slips as U.S. curbs backfire, boosting China’s chip ambitions
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-nasdaq-sp500-huawei-china-chips-1851777025
Time Published: 2025-04-21T13:48:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock fell more than 6% Monday as investors digested growing fallout from the Biden and Trump administrations’ efforts to curb the company’s chip sales to China. The latest restrictions — announced last week by the White House — tighten the noose on Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced AI chips abroad. Now Chinese competitors appear ready to fill the gap. A sharp blow came Monday from reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its own advanced AI chip — the 910C — as early as next month. The move underscores China’s accelerating effort to sidestep U.S. technology restrictions, and positions Huawei, one of China’s largest tech companies, as a potential beneficiary of the crackdown on Nvidia. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) told CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) the new export rules may ultimately “do more to help Chinese chip companies than hurt them,” by forcing domestic buyers to pivot away from U.S. suppliers. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang traveled to China last week for damage control, attempting to reassure partners and regulators that the company still wants to do business there. The White House’s tighter restrictions — part of a tech containment strategy and one more front in the administration’s trade war — specifically target Nvidia’s H20 chip, a product originally designed to comply with earlier export rules. The decision marks a strategic shift: a U.S. willingness to inflict damage on its own most valuable semiconductor company to prevent China from gaining access to leading-edge AI tools. Beijing, for its part, has slammed the U.S. approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Shares of Nvidia are down about 19% in the last month. The Nasdaq has fallen 12% over the same period, while the S&P 500 is down almost 10%. Nvidia’s global significance helps explain the U.S. market’s swift reaction. With a market cap approaching $2.5 trillion, it’s not only the world’s most valuable chipmaker, but the foundational force in AI infrastructure — powering data centers, large language models, and emerging technologies across sectors. Analysts estimate Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI training chip market, making it a linchpin in the global tech arms race. Its dominance also means Nvidia’s stock movements can sway the entire U.S. market. The company now makes up more than 6% of the Nasdaq 100 and about 5.5% of the S&P 500. As a result, Washington’s deepening trade war with China isn’t just geopolitical theater — it’s triggering real volatility and wiping out investor value across indexes, with Nvidia squarely in the middle of the storm.

U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday as Wall Street braces for a high-stakes week of earnings and mounting geopolitical uncertainty. The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%, and the Dow was off more than 400 points. The VIX surged nearly 10%, while gold spiked 2.65% to $3,416.70 — its highest level ever. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) shares were down about 4% premarket following reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. The move signals China’s accelerating push to replace U.S. technology in sensitive sectors and adds pressure on Nvidia, already under fire from new White House restrictions on chip sales. Analysts warn that Nvidia’s role as a strategic asset in the U.S.-China trade standoff could make it especially vulnerable — with powerful knock-on effects for overall U.S. markets, given Nvidia’s position as one of the largest American companies by market cap. Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) is one of the rare bright spots in early trading, rising roughly 2% after delivering a blockbuster Q1. The company posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.54 billion in revenue. Its $7.99 ad-supported tier is seen as more resilient in a tightening economy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH-1.96%) remains in focus after last week’s rout, when the stock lost more than 20% on a forecast cut and earnings miss. Shares were slightly lower again Monday morning. This week also brings earnings from Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), setting the tone for Q2 amid rising fears of a “self-inflicted” recession. In a Sunday memo, analysts at Wedbush said: “The markets and tech world needs to find a path forward quickly and know what the rules of the game are looking ahead. The White House needs trade deals done quick with a negotiation path established with China.” The alternative was grim: “Otherwise the markets, 10-year yield, USD, gold, and the economy will head down their own divergent paths over the coming weeks and months ahead. We view this as a key week ahead to get some trade deals on the board as the Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Dow drops 400 points and the Nasdaq reels as earnings season meets tariff chaos

U.S. stocks dropped sharply Monday, continuing a volatile stretch for Wall Street as geopolitical tensions, earnings anxiety, and Federal Reserve uncertainty continue to collide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest salvo against Powell came days after he said the central bank chief’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” The attacks have deepened investor fears over the Fed’s independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It’s no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere — from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared to hand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month. Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) stock fell 6% ahead of Tuesday’s earnings as investors brace for lackluster results and look for any sign of stabilization in demand or margins. With more than 100 companies reporting earnings this week — including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) — traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock was down after reports that Huawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing’s push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology — and deepens investor anxiety around Nvidia’s access to the massive Chinese market after the White House imposed additional rules on the company’s chip sales. It’s been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-“Liberation Day” levels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that’s grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is “self-inflicted,” concluding bluntly: “We are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.” One bright spot? Netflix (NFLX+2.09%). In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted an almost-$3-billion profit on $10.54 billion in revenue — with an eye-popping 31.7% operating margin. Wall Street seems especially approving of Netflix’s ad-supported $7.99 monthly membership, which appears less vulnerable to recession-driven household savings measures. Netflix stock rose 1.6% on Monday. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

One of the biggest Tesla (TSLA) bulls on Wall Street says it’s time for Elon Musk to change the narrative about his EV maker. With Tesla set to report earnings on Tuesday after the ball amid slumping sales and a cratering stock, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Musk’s latest “turnaround vision” must begin with Musk’s earnings call. Ticking off the slew of setbacks Tesla has faced this year — from becoming “a political symbol” and brand damage to “protests and violence against Tesla dealerships” and new tariffs — Ives said “we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.” “So why stay bullish? It’s a great question,” Ives wrote in a Sunday note. “We believe Tesla along with Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years. The unparalleled innovation, engineering scale, autonomous roadmap, and robotics future will unleash massive valuation upside over the coming years in our view. From earlier this year: Elon Musk is distracted. Tesla stock is cratering. Some investors want a change But Ives also said it’s time for Musk to leave his position in the Trump administration leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Wedbush said Musk faces a “Code Red Situation” if he stays at DOGE. “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,” Ives said. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing... spend some time speaking to car buyers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.” “We view this as a fork in the road time,” Ives wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage... but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Wedbush still maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla stock. The shares were down more than 5% in Monday morning trading, and have fallen almost 40% so far this year. Tesla is no longer selling the majority of electric cars registered in America’s biggest electric vehicle market. The automaker has lost significant ground in California, which accounts for almost a third of all zero-emission purchases in the country According to a publication sponsored by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), Tesla’s share of the state’s EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter of this year from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla registrations in the first quarter of 2025 fell over 15% from a year earlier — while registrations for all other EVs increased by 35%. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign and transitioned into becoming a senior White House adviser after Trump’s inauguration. He now leads DOGE, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs and enact other spending cuts, and has frequently weighed in on foreign politics. Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Many peaceful demonstrations have taken place, including a slew of protests held on Sunday, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. But more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. —Shannon Carroll and William Gavin contributed to this article.

Shaken by geopolitical shocks, the S&P 500 was flat last week and the Nasdaq nosed just into the red — but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished significantly lower, weighed down by a double blow from UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). UnitedHealth slashed its full-year forecast after a rough quarter, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping nearly 7% after reports of a new U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. It wasn’t all red arrows. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman revealed a sizable stake in the rental car firm — a bullish bet on a company still recovering from post-pandemic headwinds. Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped after announcing that its experimental weight-loss pill cleared a key late-stage trial, strengthening its position in the lucrative obesity drug market. Investors now look ahead to a packed week of earnings and economic data, with Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), AbbVie (ABBV+2.71%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) all set to report — alongside key releases on PMI, jobless claims, and the Fed’s closely watched Beige Book. Tesla’s results are set to kick things off Tuesday, and the company’s earnings will be one of the most closely watched reports of the week, with signs pointing to a potential tough quarter. Vehicle registrations in California — Tesla’s largest U.S. market — fell more than 15% year-over-year, marking a sixth straight quarterly decline. The company’s share of the state’s EV market also dropped sharply amid growing competition, an aging product lineup, and the controversial public image of CEO Elon Musk. Also on deck: SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Novartis (NVS+1.90%), two European heavyweights that will test investor confidence in multinationals navigating weak demand and shifting interest rate policy. GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) offers a read on global defense and aviation spending, while Verizon’s (VZ+1.98%) results could reveal whether telecom providers are holding the line on customer growth and capital costs. Other names to watch include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%) and Danaher (DHR+2.50%), which will offer clues on whether momentum in medical technology is holding up. Chubb (CB+2.17%) and Lockheed Martin round out the day, with updates from the insurance and defense sectors — both of which tend to attract investors during periods of economic uncertainty. IBM (IBM+1.52%) and AT&T (T+1.94%) will be in focus as bellwethers for enterprise tech and telecom — sectors that have promised stability but face rising pressure to cut costs and defend margins. Boeing also reports, with investors watching for updates on aircraft deliveries and production pace. The company now faces a fresh geopolitical headwind: reports that China has asked its airlines to halt Boeing orders, thrusting the U.S. aerospace giant into the center of escalating trade tensions. While the move won’t impact this quarter’s results, it raises new questions about the strength of Boeing’s international order book and the outlook for global demand. Markets will also be parsing April’s flash PMI data on Wednesday — key readings on both the services and manufacturing sectors, which may reveal whether the economy is cooling fast enough for the Fed’s comfort. Later that day, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book lands. Published eight times a year, the Beige Book compiles anecdotal reports from businesses across the country, offering a ground-level look at wage pressures, hiring, and consumer demand. It’s less about hard numbers and more about vibes. Alphabet will report earnings under the shadow of a major legal setback. A U.S. federal judge just ruled that the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google’s ad tech business can proceed, rejecting the company’s effort to have it thrown out. The lawsuit, which could ultimately force a breakup of Google’s advertising operations, adds a layer of uncertainty to a business already under pressure. While investors are hoping to see continued AI progress and cost control, shares remain down about 20% this year. Procter & Gamble, Merck (MRK+0.18%), T-Mobile (TMUS+2.22%), and PepsiCo (PEP+1.84%) all report Thursday, too, offering a cross-sector pulse check on consumer spending, pricing power, and healthcare demand. Also reporting: Union Pacific (UNP+1.88%), Gilead (GILD+2.77%), and Comcast (CMCSA+1.99%), bringing updates on freight volumes, drug pipelines, and broadband subscriber trends. You can also expect fresh signals on the health of the labor market and business spending, with jobless claims and durable goods orders both hitting at 8:30 a.m. ET. The numbers could either bolster hopes for rate cuts or cement the Fed’s cautious stance. It’s a fitting end to a high-stakes week: earnings from Charter (CHTR+2.18%), Aon (AON+2.74%), and HCA (HCA+2.17%) will spotlight momentum in media, insurance, and healthcare, while AbbVie, Colgate (CL+1.22%), and a cross-section of energy and services firms round out the picture. Together, they’ll offer a final read on how Q1 really landed — and set the tone for what’s next. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
