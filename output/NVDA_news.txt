Title: Retail Investors Are Buying AI Stocks, But Not the Ones They Used To

The AI trade is back on after April's tariff rout, but retail investor purchases suggest it's taking a new shape. After a surge in dip buying following April's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement, "there's been a clear shift away from Mag 7+ names" into "second-derivative AI laggards and other higher-risk opportunities," according to a recent analysis of retail investor flows by Marco Iachini and Lucas Mantle at Vanda Research. Nvidia (NVDA), a favorite among retail investors over the last few years, saw large outflows starting in mid-May after shares jumped on easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Purchases of leveraged ETFs, which double or triple Nvidia's daily return, slumped to a 1-year low last month, "though options activity shows no signs of bearish positioning," according to Vanda. "We interpret this as classic profit-taking." Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are down since the start of the year, but nearly the entire group has sharply rebounded from early April's tariff panic. Retail investors who bought the dip are likely locking in profits from these "core portfolio holdings." While investors are pivoting from the Magnificent Seven, they're not abandoning the AI trade. Rather, investors are piling into smaller data center stocks like Applied Digital (APLD), Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS), and CoreWeave (CRWV), all of which are affiliated with Nvidia. Retail investor purchases of each increased by more than 150% over the past month. Mom-and-pop traders have also been big buyers of quantum computing stocks, a reflection of their substantial risk appetite. In the last week of May, retail investors bought more D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), with its $6 billion market cap, than they did UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a $275 billion company. In the time that investors bought a net $17 million of Meta (META) stock, they funneled $25 million into Rigetti Computing (RGTI). Iachini and Mantle note it's common for retail investors to venture into riskier corners of the market after a successful bout of dip-buying. But plenty of uncertainty about tariff policy and the economic outlook remain despite the market's recent rebound. Retail investors taking on more risk recently, "while not unusual, suggests a level of complacency that may be mismatched with still-lingering macro risks and thus adds to our sense that we are living in the final innings of the current equity rally," they wrote. The market's risk appetite was on full display Monday, with the small-cap Russell 2000 and tech-heavy Nasdaq leading U.S. stock indexes higher. Shares of Navitas Semiconductor were up nearly 25% in recent trading, while CoreWeave advanced 15%.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got the rockstar treatment during London Tech Week — and even garnered some comparisons to Tony Stark The conference attendees waited in long lines before the conference opened to get a good seat for Huang’s event with the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Many people didn’t even manage to get into the talk. “He’s like Iron Man,” one conference goer told CNBC about Huang. “The amount of infrastructure required for AI wouldn’t be possible without that man.” The Nvidia (NVDA) co-founder and CEO called the U.K. “the envy of the world” in a “Goldilocks circumstance,” during his appearance. Huang also told the audience that Nvidia will continue to pour cash into Britain, which he called “such a great place to invest.” The company will start an AI lab there and wants to upskill the workforce. He said, “Because of AI, every industry in the U.K. will be a tech industry.” He added: “The U.K. has one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet, the deepest thinkers, the best universities…and the third largest AI capital investment of anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, Starmer emphasized the country’s “sovereign AI ambitions,” stating that the government will invest £1 billion in AI by 2030. Huang’s appearance in London kicked off his European tour. He plans to visit Paris this week, where he is likely to meet with French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron. Nvidia is also working with Germany to help them build a supercomputer using Nvidia architecture and with Sweden to construct the Scandinavian country’s first national AI infrastructure.

These often require context, judgment, and adaptation, making them difficult to automate with simple rule-based code. While traditional automation is possible, it usually means hardcoding endless edge cases. Agents offer a more flexible approach. They use context to decide what to do next, reducing manual effort on tedious steps while keeping a review process in place for important decisions. The most effective AI agents are narrow, tightly scoped, and domain-specific. Here's how to approach building one. Start by simulating the agent manually, before writing any code. Understand the task the way a person would approach it, step by step. Use real inputs, whether they’re screenshots, API responses, or messy CSV data. Feed those into an LLM manually and guide it through the process with prompts that mirror the actual workflow. As you go, perform any resulting actions yourself. Pay attention to which parts feel repetitive or mechanical. These are strong candidates for automation later. Expect early results to be rough. When we started building v0.dev in 2023, LLMs struggled to generate reliable HTML. The breakthrough wasn’t from better models, but from narrowing the scope and using structured inputs with Tailwind. If the model consistently fails to make progress, even with adjustments, the task may not be a good fit for an agent. But if it works, or even comes close, it’s worth continuing. Once your manual simulation shows that the task is viable, begin writing code. This is where you build the skeleton of your agent. Start by automating how it collects inputs. Use APIs, scrapers, screenshots, or anything else that fits the problem, then model the agent’s process as a loop or a simple state machine. Gather input, perform deterministic computation where possible, call the model when logic or judgment is needed, evaluate the result, and decide whether to continue or exit. LLMs are non-deterministic. If you can write a normal function to handle a step, do it. Use plain code for parsing, calculating, or sorting. Anything that does not require reasoning. Example of a stock analysis agent Don't be afraid of plain old programming. Save the LLM for parts that truly need judgment. Building AI agents might seem like a new thing that calls for new abstractions, but it is just regular programming. Use if statements, loops, or switches, whatever fits. Don’t overthink the structure. For common patterns, see our AI SDK agent docs. The agent "works" when it reliably produces acceptable results with little to no intervention. Now that the agent is running end to end, shift your focus to improving quality. This means making the agent perform well on both specific examples and a wide range of real-world inputs. Start by tightening the loop. Refine your prompts. Make tool calls more precise. Remove unnecessary retries. Replace model calls with plain deterministic functions wherever you can. If the agent produces incomplete results, use a second model to critique the results of the first model and continue the work. At this stage, intuition and hands-on testing are your best tools. Iterate until the agent feels solid when running against real examples. Once the core loop is stable, introduce structured evaluations to test performance across a broad range of inputs and edge cases. This helps catch regressions early and ensures quality holds up as the agent evolves. AI agents expand what software can do, but building one doesn't require reinventing how you think about programming. The most reliable agents are built with the same fundamentals: clear logic, good structure, and tight feedback loops. Before committing to any implementation, test the task manually using real inputs and prompts. If the model can almost get there with help, it’s probably worth building. From there, structure the logic using ordinary code and only rely on the model when necessary. Once the agent is working, focus on making it resilient. Both on individual inputs and across real-world complexity. To recap, agents are useful when: The task is difficult to automate with traditional code Prompting the model manually shows signs of success You scope the agent narrowly and build on solid software practices You optimize both with hands-on intuition and structured evaluation When built right, AI agents feel like magic. But there’s no sorcery behind it. Just smart systems with reasoning built in. Ready to build? Get started with the AI SDK to build reliable, scoped AI agents using real software patterns.

Title: Recession Risk After The Jobs Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/06/08/recession-risk-after-the-jobs-report/
Time Published: 2025-06-08T13:19:46Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Stocks and the 10-year US Treasury yield rose after the solid monthly payrolls report on Friday. ... More Market performance has been closely tied to economic data since the early April stock lows. Stocks have marched higher since their early April low as the fear of an impending recession has receded. The S&P 500 is 2.3% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 8.9% below its mid-December level. With many crosscurrents remaining, it seems appropriate to revisit the status of some timely recession indicators. Market Performance Accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging. However, in an environment with tariff threats, monitoring specific high-frequency data can provide an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available on a monthly basis, sometimes with a significant time lag. Despite the economic data remaining resilient, consensus estimates of 2025 US GDP growth remain well below the levels seen earlier in the year. Economists generally expect the drag from tariffs to slow economic growth in the second half of the year. Consensus US GDP Growth Forecasts Baa corporate bond data has a long history and provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield that investors demand beyond US Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk associated with buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. Spreads on Baa corporate debt are below the highs hit as stocks bottomed in early April. The narrowing of spreads is consistent with a lower risk of economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) on a weekly basis. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart indicates that periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have frequently been correlated with recessions. Similar to credit spreads, the tightness of financial conditions has eased from the early-April highs. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been outperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. The improved performance of cyclical stocks suggests that the economic growth scare is waning. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is arguably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the US 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also known as yield curve inversion, a recession is likely to follow. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which did not produce subsequent economic recessions. The US economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has widely variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better predictive track record than economists and is used in nearly every Federal Reserve model; therefore, it is worth watching despite its flaws. The curve is not currently inverted and has generally been steepening instead. Yield Curve The labor market is the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. Initial claims are ticking higher, but the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or one consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. The uptrend suggests that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new ones. Recall that the number of employees in the US has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The labor market is softening, but it has not yet reached the tipping point. Continuing Claims The closely watched monthly jobs report was released on Friday. Payroll job growth was slightly better than expected at 139,000, but the previous two months were revised lower. The household survey reported job losses of 696,000, but the labor force contracted by a similar amount, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. Monthly Job Growth Examining the employment of prime working-age people, aged 25 to 54, can provide a good indicator of the labor market’s condition. In addition to being a crucial group, the measure also avoids some of the demographic distortions associated with other methods. Prime-age employment to population ratio fell month-over-month, but using the three-month average to remove volatility, it held steady. The trend appears to be flat to lower, which adds some concern to the outlook. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Overall, job growth is adequate, with the labor market bending lower but not yet breaking. Markets reacted favorably to the monthly jobs report on Friday, indicating less worry about the economic outlook, with US Treasury yields and stocks moving higher. Lastly, the betting market has seen a steep drop in the odds of a recession in 2025. Betting odds move much more quickly than consensus estimates and should be considered more accurate since real dollars are at stake regarding the outcome. 2025 US Recession Betting Odds Wednesday’s May consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be closely watched as some tariff-related price increases are expected to be reflected. On the other hand, some other price decreases should keep the headline inflation growth in check. Consensus expects a 2.5% year-over-year rate, up from 2.3% last month. The Cleveland Fed’s estimate for May CPI is a bit lower at 2.4%. US CPI Inflation Estimate The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday will be notable. Consumer sentiment plummeted with the announcement of the wide-ranging tariffs on Liberation Day. While economic activity has not followed suit, the sharp plunge in sentiment has raised concerns about an eventual downturn. A rebound in sentiment would be welcome and could help alleviate those concerns. Stocks have rebounded as the odds of a recession have fallen. There is still room for the odds to fall further, but the risk remains that they could rise again in the event of a reignition of a hotter trade war. Additionally, the pull forward in activity from and the weights of the tariffs will likely be seen in slower economic growth in the second half of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds While much of the existing US tariffs could be struck down by the courts, President Trump has other methods to implement tariffs, even if they take more time and effort. The possible headwinds from the tax-like impact of tariffs remain a threat. On the other hand, the US and China are meeting in London on Monday to negotiate trade matters, which always has the potential to de-escalate the conflict. Successful trade negotiations would help offset the tariff drag. The House of Representatives passed the “big beautiful tax bill,” so the Senate is now working on it. The final bill is almost certain to include significant growth provisions, such as the extension of expiring tax cuts, additional consumer tax cuts, and the expensing of business investments. If passed, these growth initiatives could provide some sweet dessert to make the tariff vegetables more palatable to economic growth. Investors should note that stocks are pricing in a relatively low risk of recession in 2025 and perhaps looking beyond a possible second-half soft patch to a brighter 2026. This rosy outlook could be correct, and there are potential upsides, as noted previously. However, the labor market appears to be fraying at the edges, so dodging an economic downturn is no sure thing. A host of high-frequency indicators still point to no sign of imminent recession, however.

Title: XOVR ETF Adds Anduril, Joining SpaceX to Offer Pre-IPO Access

June 06, 2025 15:48 ET | Source: EntrepreneurShares EntrepreneurShares NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ERShares, the first Crossover ETF that offers retail investors access to Private companies, with SpaceX as its top weight, is ushering in the next generation of investing with a new private equity position in Anduril Industries. Through the XOVR ETF, which primarily invests (85% +) in the US Entrepreneurial Large Cap ER30TR Index, ERShares continues ...its pursuit to provide retail investors access to private equity—which we believe offers exposure to high-growth, entrepreneurial companies typically reserved for institutions and high net worth investors, and does so at the same pricing available to those accredited investors. XOVR complies with SEC guidelines by keeping private equity exposure under 15%, with over 85% of the portfolio tracking the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR)—built on ERShares’ proprietary Entrepreneur model, applied to public markets for more than two decades. Given its weighting, the ER30TR Index drives the majority of XOVR’s return, while the private holdings offer potential upside and added diversification. Private equity investments can experience significant price swings—both upward and downward—over extended periods, even if valuations are not marked frequently. Additionally, private equities are inherently less liquid and less transparent than their public counterparts, resulting in higher risk profiles despite comparable market capitalizations. As with all investments, public equities can be volatile, though they have historically offered meaningful return potential over time. Private companies may magnify both opportunity and risk, which is why ERShares encourages investors to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. To help manage risk, ERShares applies structured parameters around the size and scope of its private holdings. The due diligence process for these positions mirrors the same rigorous methodology used in constructing the ER30TR Index—adapted for private markets. Relaunched on August 29, 2024, XOVR became the first ETF to blend public equities with private equity holdings – potentially delivering diversified, liquid access to both high-growth public companies and elite pre-IPO firms. This ETF Crossover structure helps bridge two previously disconnected markets in one transparent vehicle. On May 30, 2025, ERShares initiated a $3M (approx. 1%) investment in Anduril, marking XOVR’s third private equity holding - after SpaceX ($33M, approx. 10%) and Klarna ($2M, less than 1%) - and establishing Anduril as its second-largest private position. The move reflects ERShares’ conviction in companies that sit at the intersection of innovation, national importance, and scalable disruption. The position was selected after extensive internal research and due diligence, consistent with ERShares’ proprietary Venture Capital-style framework for evaluating private and public companies. “Our proprietary research model identifies category-defining companies before they go public,” said Dr. Joel Shulman, Founder and CIO of ERShares. “Anduril embodies the deep tech leadership and mission-driven innovation we seek for XOVR.” ERShares also recently increased its SpaceX position at $185 per share - matching its previous entries - to reaffirm confidence in the company’s valuation amid market speculation. Bridging Public and Private Markets “We’re not just following innovation - we’re positioning investors at its source,” said Eva Ados, Chief Investment Strategist at ERShares. “Whether private or public, our focus is on trying to identify the next Magnificent Seven (The "Magnificent 7" currently refers to a group of seven large-cap, high-growth U.S. technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA))—those rare, transformational companies that have the potential to shape entire decades of innovation and growth.” Anduril Industries: The Next Generation of Defense Technology Founded by Palmer Luckey - creator of Oculus and a key early collaborator with Palantir - Anduril Industries represents the next generation of defense technology. Anduril is rapidly becoming foundational to U.S. military modernization initiatives. Transparent Valuation Backed by Research ERShares uses a structured valuation methodology to price private equity holdings - drawing from tender offers, internal transactions, IPO indicators, and comparables – to help ensure pricing is fair, consistent, and market-aware. This framework helps protect investors while maintaining daily liquidity and regulatory compliance. Investing in the Future - Before the IPO With positions in SpaceX, Klarna, and now Anduril, XOVR remains the only ETF offering diversified access to potentially high growth private companies alongside expanding public innovators. The fund allows investors to participate in the potential next wave of value creation - before it goes public. “We built XOVR to give retail investors access to leading private companies at the critical pre-IPO stage,” added Dr. Shulman. “It is time they participate in the value creation that was once reserved only for institutions and accredited investors.” Past performance is no guarantee of future results, please refer to the disclosures below for important risk information: https://entrepreneurshares.com/disclosures/ All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.
