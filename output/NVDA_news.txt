Major U.S. equities indexes retreated from recent highs as investors digested fresh economic data ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Friday's move lower came after the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—a gauge of inflation closely monitored by the Federal Reserve—showed a month-over-month uptick in "core" PCE inflation in July. The S&P 500 and the Dow declined 0.2% and 0.6%, after closing Thursday at record levels. Underperformance from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 1.2%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) tumbled 8.9%, suffering the heaviest daily loss of any stock in the S&P 500. Although strong demand related to artificial intelligence helped the maker of personal computers, servers, and other IT hardware topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates, Dell's guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below consensus estimates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares dropped 7.1%. The decline reversed solid gains posted by the stock in the prior session. The cosmetics retailer late yesterday posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter and boosted its full-year revenue guidance. Ulta faces continued uncertainty related to potential tariff impacts. Although many stocks with exposure to AI initially gained ground in the wake of the latest earnings report from AI semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), the rally lost steam on Friday. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the enterprise software firm that has recently announced major investments in AI and cloud infrastructure, slipped 5.9%, while shares of AI-focused server manufacturer Super Micro Computer (SMCI) ended 5.5% lower. Autodesk (ADSK) shares bucked the downward pressure on the broader tech sector and software industries, jumping 9.1% to log the S&P 500's top performance. The engineering and design software provider topped second-quarter sales and adjusted profit estimates and lifted its full-year forecasts. Demand for its design software for AI data centers helped underpin the performance. Shares of Cooper Cos. (COO), a medical device maker focused vision care and surgical products, advanced 4.4%. With the move higher heading into the holiday weekend, Cooper stock clawed back a portion of the heavy losses posted Thursday after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates and lowered its full-year sales forecast. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock also staged a recovery on Friday from a post-earnings swoon suffered earlier in the week, adding 3.6%. The maker of its namesake fruit spreads as well as the Hostess snack cake brand reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter and noted that tariffs were having a negative impact on its coffee business. On its earnings call, the company said it anticipates additional price hikes as it navigates tariff-related cost pressure.

The chips are down to close out August. A range of chip stocks slid Friday, weighing on the major U.S. equities indexes in the last trading session of the month. China concerns weighed on the sector, but that wasn't the only factor that pulled shares lower. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) among its biggest decliners. The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit. The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year. Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand. "We've now shipped $10 billion of AI solutions in the first half of FY26, surpassing all shipments in FY25. This helped deliver another record revenue quarter in our Servers and Networking business, which grew 69%," COO Jeff Clarke said. "Demand for our AI solutions continues to be exceptional, and we're raising our AI server shipment guidance for FY26 to $20 billion" from $15 billion-plus. Citi analysts said in a note Friday that Dell's Q2 PC segment sales were below consensus forecasts "by 3% or roughly $357.0 million," and that it "likely lost share in PCs." It added that the increase in its AI server shipment guidance is good news for Nvidia (NVDA), which makes up 88% of its sales, and Micron Technology (MU), at 17%. "Dell expects the traditional server business to grow in the 2nd half but below their prior expectations from the beginning of the year," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-earnings-sustain-the-ai-stock-rally-just-without-nvidia-11800018
Time Published: 2025-08-28T23:15:37Z

Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday. The results were driven by “strength in migrations,” according to Citi analysts, suggesting “large enterprises' increasing budget allocation towards database modernization as part of AI projects.” UBS analysts pointed to several other reasons, aside from AI hype, to be optimistic about the prospects for technology stocks this year. "Second-quarter earnings for big tech have been robust and broad-based, with most companies beating both sales and EPS estimates," the analysts wrote. They expect tech earnings to grow 15% this year, and hold in the low teens next year. Earnings should be boosted in the near term by U.S. dollar weakness. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 10% since the start of the year, a decline that, by UBS estimates, should translate to a roughly 2.5% increase in the S&P 500's earnings. "We see more room for the US dollar to decline from current levels, with the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle set to kick off next month." High stock valuations have been a recurring source of anxiety for tech investors throughout the AI rally. "Valuations are currently at the upper end of historical ranges," the analysts note, but recent surveys of individual investors and assessments of institutional portfolios suggest there's room for the market to become even more bullish on mega-cap tech stocks.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose as investors digested quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA), the world's highest valued company, and a report showing a positive revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% on Thursday, securing a second straight all-time closing high and finishing a day above 6500 for the first time. The Dow gained 0.2%, joining the broader benchmark index in record closing territory, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%, closing just below its record level. Nvidia, for its part, fell less than 1%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Datadog (DDOG) shares logged the S&P 500's top daily performance, jumping 7%. Thursday's surge for Datadog stock added to gains posted in the previous session following a strong earnings report from fellow database software specialist MongoDB (MDB). Datadog has launched several new products this year that leverage artificial intelligence technology to enhance its platform's database-monitoring capabilities, helping revenue growth. Shares of Fair Isaac (FICO), the data analytics company known for its consumer credit scores, advanced 6.1%. The stock has come under pressure in recent months following criticism of its pricing scheme by William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who announced in July that mortgage lenders would be able to use FICO competitor VantageScore to evaluate the credit of potential borrowers. Some analysts have lately grown more positive on the shares, citing among other reasons its pricing strength for credit evaluations. Agilent Technologies (A) surpassed sales and profit expectations for its fiscal third quarter, and shares of the health sciences company gained 5.3%. The company also issued stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, highlighting strong demand in its pharmaceutical end markets and its chemicals and advanced materials segment. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares plummeted 13%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. The maker of deli meats and parent company of brands including Spam and Skippy reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter, topping revenue estimates but falling short of adjusted profit expectations. The company attributed its lackluster performance to increases in commodity input costs. Hormel expects this trend to continue in the current quarter and said it plans pricing action to address the inflationary pressure. Cooper Companies (COO) lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025, citing soft demand for contact lenses, and shares of the medical device maker dropped nearly 13%. Cooper's revenue for the third quarter also missed analysts' forecasts, although adjusted profit came in slightly ahead of estimates. Citi analysts downgraded Cooper stock to "neutral" from "buy." Shares of Brown-Forman (BF.B) sank 4.9% after the alcoholic beverage maker reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal first quarter. Although the Jack Daniel's parent slightly surpassed estimates with its top-line results for the period, boosted by demand for its ready-to-drink beverages, sales were down from a year ago. The company discussed consumer uncertainty amid the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, noting that the absence of U.S.-made spirits in most Canadian markets added to pressure on its international business.

Title: Nvidia Stock Down 1.2%. Why Growth May Slow And Why Not To Buy $NVDA

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's Q2 2026 results beat overall expectations, but data center revenue fell short, primarily due to the lack of sales in China.The company's revenue and stock price growth rates are decelerating, with future explosive growth challenged by market saturation and elusive AI investment returns.Re-entry into the Chinese market offers significant revenue upside, but remains subject to geopolitical uncertainties. Nvidia stock fell 1.2% Wednesday after reporting record sales, falling short on data-center revenue, and predicting cooler growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this slight dip represent a buying opportunity? If Nvidia can accelerate revenue growth, its share price will rise. Here are three reasons that may not happen: Nvidia is optimistic about the company’s future. “This year is a record-breaking year,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, reported the Journal. “I expect next year to be a record-breaking year” as well, he added. With the exception of its data center business, Nvidia beat expectations in Q2 2026 and issued slower Q3 growth guidance – still ahead of analyst forecasts. Overall, the chip designer reported “better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%,” according to CNBC. Here are the key numbers: The absence of revenue from China affected Nvidia’s data center results. The company generated $33.8 billion in GPU data center sales – a 1% decline from the first quarter. The company sold $4 billion fewer H20 chips – which are designated for the Chinese market, Nvidia chief financial officer Colleen Kress said in a statement. Nvidia is bullish on its latest GPUs – the Blackwell line. Their revenue increased 17% between the first and second quarters – indicating “demand is extraordinary,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Journal. In May, Nvidia said Blackwell – which accounted for roughly 70% of data center revenue – reached $27 billion in sales, reported CNBC. The company sees tremendous growth ahead. The largest AI companies will spend $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, based on their current level of capital expenditures, and Nvidia could capture “as much as 70% of that revenue,” Huang said, according to the Journal. Will Nvidia’s efforts to revive sales in China succeed? The answer could depend on political considerations. During the quarter, after Huang met with President Donald Trump, Nvidia hinted it may get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. Indeed the president “changed his mind in August and allowed H20 sales to resume after Huang visited the White House and pledged to give the federal government a 15% cut of AI-chip revenue earned in China,” the Journal reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia took $4.5 billion in writedowns because of the lack of sales and said the H20 would have added $8 billion in second-quarter had the company been able to sell them, CNBC noted. Kress told investors Nvidia could generate between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the current quarter if the geopolitical environment permits. Nvidia’s stock price growth depends on the company’s ability to grow faster than investors expect. The company’s growth and stock price have slowed down in parallel. How so? In 2023, Nvidia revenue was up 126%, according to Macrotrends, while the stock soared 230%, noted Google Finance. In 2024, the company’s revenue increased 113% while its stock price rose 194%. In the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased 56% and the stock has risen 29% so far this year. This suggests the stock will keep going up more slowly unless Nvidia can grow much faster. However, if the company resumed growing at 100% a year for the next decade, revenue would soar from $176 billion in the last year to $360 trillion in 2036. Sadly, such growth is impossible unless Nvidia targets new – much larger markets. After all, the global market for semiconductors is around $600 billion – much smaller than the gigantic 2036 revenue figure. Will Nvidia’s data center growth decelerate significantly? The answer depends on whether companies remain as eager as they now appear to be to use AI chatbots. For instance, enterprise technology spending grew 75% to $4.9 trillion in 2024 while large technology companies boosted AI capital expenditures from $245 billion in 2024 to $320 billion in 2025, according to Computerworld. Unfortunately, these capital expenditures have not yielded profits. That’s because 95% of companies surveyed received no return on their AI investment. Only 5% of companies generated returns on AI – which averaged 3.7 times what they invested, noted a report from the MIT NANDA Institute. If the economy contracts due to rising tariff-induced inflation and return on AI remains small, will companies keep spending so much on the technology? If companies cut back on their AI spending, it is only a matter of time before such a slowdown reduces Nvidia’s data center revenue growth even more? Investors see some upside in the stock. Nvidia’s shares could rise about 14% to reach the average price target of $205 per share set by 31 analysts covered by TipRanks. In my view the biggest potential for upside would happen if the Chinese market reopens for Nvidia. Unfortunately, that market could continue to be a political football. Unless Nvidia can find new growth opportunities, the best days of owning its stock may be in the rear view mirror.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground Thursday morning even as the AI chipmaker and investor favorite reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates. While the results, released late Wednesday, broadly came in slightly better than expected, sales in the data center segment, which comprise the bulk of the company's revenue, were slightly below Wall Street estimates. The outlook for the current quarter—which excludes sales of H20 chips to China amid uncertainty about whether exports to the country will resume—also disappointed some investors. Market participants have come to expect that Nvidia's results and guidance will always blow past expectations. Nvidia shares were down 1.5% at around $179 in midday trading. Coming into today's session the stock had gained 35% since the start of the year, making it the biggest gainer among members of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap technology stocks, amid booming demand from major companies building their AI infrastructure. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and use technical analysis to point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After registering a fresh all-time high earlier this month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways, indicating apprehension among market participants ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results. While the relative strength index remained in bullish territory leading into earnings, the indicator had made consistently lower highs since topping out in mid-July, signaling weakening buying momentum. Let’s identify key support levels to watch and point out an important overhead area worth eyeing if the stock rallies. Initial earnings-driven selling could see the shares test key support around $174. This area may attract buying interest near the mid-July peak and a minor retracement in the stock last week. A close below this location may lead to a retest of support at the $159 level. Investors could look for entry points in this area near the June high, which preceded a brief two-day dip before the stock resumed its uptrend. Further selling opens the door for a decline to the key $150 level. The shares would likely encounter support in this region never multiple peaks that formed on the chart between November and January. Interestingly, this level closely aligns with a downside bars pattern target that takes the move lower following the chipmaker’s 2024 third-quarter earnings report and repositions it from the stock’s recent highs. This analysis provides clues as to how a similar post-earnings profit-taking phase may unfold. If Nvidia shares resume their longer-term move higher, investors should eye the $183 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s recent trading levels just below the record high.
