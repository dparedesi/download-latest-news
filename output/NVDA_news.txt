A future where everyone has an artificial intelligence-powered assistant might not be too far off. While tech giants and AI startups have been racing to launch the smartest AI-powered chatbots, recent AI product rollouts point to a shift toward developing the most helpful AI-powered assistants — or as some in the tech industry are calling them, AI agents. While addressing concerns over the impact AI will have on jobs, Nvidia (NVDA+4.84%) chief executive Jensen Huang said that it’s likely every job, including his, will be transformed by the technology, because everyone will eventually have an AI assistant. Even Nvidia’s chip designers are using AI assistants, Huang said during an interview at the industry conference SIGGRAPH 2024. Without AI assistants, the company’s highly sought-after Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s leading AI models, wouldn’t have been possible, he said. The same apparently goes for the chipmaker’s new AI platform, Blackwell. “I think the main reason is that the value that they capture and generate is just a magnitude different from what we’ve had so far,” Daniel Vassilev, co-founder and chief executive of Relevance AI, told Quartz. “What agents are kind of promising us is this future where they can complete work that was previously impossible to be done with automation.” Companies are starting to focus on AI agents because “everyone realizes now that we’re in a place where the future is going to look very different — we’re going to have the capacity to do a whole lot more,” Vassilev said. “I think a lot of people are realizing that the old way of doing things is probably also going to change.” Simply put, an AI agent is software that can complete complex tasks autonomously. So far, most AI-powered tools have been co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, Vassilev said. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, is a co-pilot. Users can interact with and work alongside ChatGPT, “but it’s still ultimately an assistant” that has to be prompted over and over, Vassilev said. With AI agents, users can delegate work to the tool, then check to see if it needs assistance or if it has finished. Vassilev’s company, Relevance, develops virtual workforces of AI agents that are used by major companies including Activision and Roku (ROKU-0.59%). Rebecca Greene, co-founder and chief technology officer of Regal, said AI agents are “like humans” that can be given personas and jobs to do. But, Greene said, AI agents are not meant to trick customers into thinking they’re speaking to a real human. “When you’re calling them or when they’re calling you, they know exactly what they’re trying to accomplish, what their goals are, what their personality is,” Greene said. Regal, which develops purpose-built AI agents for call centers, believes 90% of interactions in contact centers are going to be AI-led over the next ten years, Greene said. For now, most AI agents are simple, Greene said, such as those used for setting up doctor’s appointments. “An AI agent can place a phone call, not take the doctor’s time, speak to the customer on the other side, find a mutually agreeable time to schedule something, book that appointment in the doctor’s calendar, and the customer confirms it,” she said. So far, Greene said Regal’s clients see acceptance from customers for AI agents, which can perform better than some humans in areas such as speaking in several languages, being available at all hours of the day, and keeping composure in difficult situations. At SIGGRAPH 2024 in July, Meta (META+1.21%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the wider rollout of Meta’s platform, AI Studio, which allows users and creators to generate AI characters of themselves that can act as an assistant for different tasks, including interacting with their community. Meta’s vision, Zuckerberg said, is to empower users, from creators to small businesses, to create agents for themselves. In October, Microsoft (MSFT+0.42%) announced that its Copilot customers would soon be able to build their own “autonomous agents” in Copilot Studio, that can “understand” their work and “act” on their behalf. “These models offer more precise predictions, enhanced natural language processing, and improved decision-making support,” Microsoft said. Meanwhile AI startup OpenAI is reportedly preparing to launch an AI agent, codenamed “Operator,” that can do tasks on behalf of a person, including coding and booking travel, Bloomberg reported. The startup is also reportedly close to completing another AI agent project that can perform tasks in a web browser. As companies begin adopting AI agents, they will likely invest in building their own, Greene said, that align with their industry-use cases and that are trained on their data. Vassilev said the focus will be on less-risky parts of a business, such as highly-repetitive and monotonous tasks that workers don’t want to do. Now that companies realize that “2025 is going to be the year of AI agents,” Vassilev said he expects an uptick in AI agent products. Alongside that, people will have to build trust with AI agents the way they would with a human co-worker. “When you’re hiring someone, you want to trust them, you want to know they’re doing a good job,” Vassilev said. “I think in a similar way, when you’re adopting an agent that’s going to be autonomous, you also need to build that trust.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

November 18, 2024 13:33 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA ATLANTA, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC24 -- NVIDIA today announced an NVIDIA Omniverse™ Blueprint that enables industry software developers to help their computer-aided engineering (CAE) customers in aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, energy and other industries create digital twins with real-time interactivity. Software developers such as Altair, Ansys, Cadence and Siemens can use the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for real-time computer-aided engineering digital twins to help their customers drive down development costs and energy usage while getting to market faster. The blueprint is a reference workflow that includes NVIDIA acceleration libraries, physics-AI frameworks and interactive physically based rendering to achieve 1,200x faster simulations and real-time visualization. “We built Omniverse so that everything can have a digital twin,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Omniverse Blueprints are reference pipelines that connect NVIDIA Omniverse with AI technologies, enabling leading CAE software developers to build groundbreaking digital twin workflows that will transform industrial digitalization, from design and manufacturing to operations, for the world’s largest industries.” One of the first applications of the blueprint is computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a critical step to virtually explore, test and refine the designs of cars, airplanes, ships and many other products. Traditional engineering workflows — from physics simulation to visualization and design optimization — can take weeks or even months to complete. In an industry first, NVIDIA and Luminary Cloud are demonstrating at SC24 a virtual wind tunnel that allows users to simulate and visualize fluid dynamics at real-time, interactive speeds, even when changing the vehicle model inside the tunnel. Unifying Three Pillars of NVIDIA Technology for DevelopersBuilding a real-time physics digital twin requires two fundamental capabilities: real-time physics solver performance and real-time visualization of large-scale datasets. The Omniverse Blueprint achieves these by bringing together NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries to accelerate the solvers, the NVIDIA Modulus physics-AI framework to train and deploy models to generate flow fields, and NVIDIA Omniverse application programming interfaces for 3D data interoperability and real-time RTX-enabled visualization. Developers can integrate the blueprint as individual elements or in its entirety into their existing tools. Ecosystem Uses NVIDIA Blueprint to Advance SimulationsAnsys is the first to adopt the Omniverse Blueprint, applying it to Ansys Fluent fluid simulation software to enable accelerated CFD simulation. Ansys ran Fluent at the Texas Advanced Computing Center on 320 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. A 2.5-billion-cell automotive simulation was completed in just over six hours, which would have taken nearly a month running on 2,048 x86 CPU cores, significantly enhancing the feasibility of overnight high-fidelity CFD analyses and establishing a new industry benchmark. “By integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint with Ansys software, we’re enabling our customers to tackle increasingly complex and detailed simulations more quickly and accurately,” said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. “Our collaboration is pushing the boundaries of engineering and design across multiple industries.” Luminary Cloud is also adopting the blueprint. The company’s new simulation AI model, built on NVIDIA Modulus, learned the relationships between airflow fields and car geometry based on training data generated from its GPU-accelerated CFD solver. The model runs simulations orders of magnitude faster than the solver itself, enabling real-time aerodynamic flow simulation that is visualized using Omniverse APIs. Altair, Beyond Math, Cadence, Hexagon, Neural Concept, Siemens, SimScale and Trane Technologies are also exploring adoption of the Omniverse Blueprint into their own applications. The Omniverse Blueprint can be run on all leading cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It is also available on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud. Rescale, a cloud-based platform that helps organizations accelerate scientific and engineering breakthroughs, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint to enable organizations to train and deploy custom AI models in just a few clicks. The Rescale platform automates the full application-to-hardware stack and can be run across any cloud service provider. Organizations can generate training data using any simulation solver; prepare, train and deploy the AI models; run inference predictions; and visualize and optimize models.

Title: NVIDIA Accelerates Google Quantum AI Processor Design With Simulation of Quantum Device Physics

SC24—NVIDIA today announced it is working with Google Quantum AI to accelerate the design of its next-generation quantum computing devices using simulations powered by the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ platform. Google Quantum AI is using the hybrid quantum-classical computing platform and the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to simulate the physics of its quantum processors. This will help overcome the current limitations of quantum computing hardware, which can only run a certain number of quantum operations before computations must cease, due to what researchers call “noise.” “The development of commercially useful quantum computers is only possible if we can scale up quantum hardware while keeping noise in check,” said Guifre Vidal, research scientist from Google Quantum AI. “Using NVIDIA accelerated computing, we’re exploring the noise implications of increasingly larger quantum chip designs.” Understanding noise in quantum hardware designs requires complex dynamical simulations capable of fully capturing how qubits within a quantum processor interact with their environment. These simulations have traditionally been prohibitively computationally expensive to pursue. Using the CUDA-Q platform, however, Google can employ 1,024 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs at the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to perform one of the world’s largest and fastest dynamical simulation of quantum devices — at a fraction of the cost. “AI supercomputing power will be helpful to quantum computing’s success,” said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. “Google’s use of the CUDA-Q platform demonstrates the central role GPU-accelerated simulations have in advancing quantum computing to help solve real-world problems.” With CUDA-Q and H100 GPUs, Google can perform fully comprehensive, realistic simulations of devices containing 40 qubits — the largest-performed simulations of this kind. The simulation techniques provided by CUDA-Q mean noisy simulations that would have taken a week can now run in minutes. The software powering these accelerated dynamic simulations will be publicly available in the CUDA-Q platform, allowing quantum hardware engineers to rapidly scale their system designs.

Title: The 2 biggest stock market risks in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs
URL: https://qz.com/goldman-sachs-stock-market-risks-investors-2025-1851701778
Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:00:00Z

As 2024 comes to a close, the U.S. stock market has posted considerable returns on a red-hot rally led by major technology stocks that have benefited from artificial intelligence. But Goldman Sachs (GS-1.15%) is warning of two major risks that could put a damper on the stock market party in 2025. The first big risk is the recent wave of optimism — fueled by Donald Trump’s election win, lower interest rates, and overall enthusiasm about the economy — could front-load returns and leave the market vulnerable to a correction, strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a research note published Monday. Given that global equities have risen 40% since October 2023, there is much more room for disappointment and less opportunity for valuations to rise, the strategists said. There is also uncertainty around the impact of the incoming Trump administration’s policies. “There are still many unknowns around tariff risks, for example, and the impact on global growth and inflation,” they wrote. The president-elect has proposed implementing sweeping tariffs, including levying a broad 10% to 20% tariff on imports from all nations, alongside a much steeper 60% to 100% tariff specifically targeting goods from China. This could push up prices on a number of key products in the U.S. Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump’s election win. The second risk is linked to what Goldman refers to as the “unusual degree of market concentration.” The biggest 10 U.S. stocks account for over 20% of the entire value of the global market index, according to the researchers. These companies include mega cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL+0.11%), Microsoft (MSFT+0.42%), Amazon (AMZN+1.44%), Nvidia (NVDA+4.84%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.61%), and Meta (META+1.21%). They account for 36% of the S&P 500 index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 37%, compared with 31% for the index as a whole. This level of market concentration is associated with a number of threats to the market, particularly as the mega cap tech stocks shift from being relatively capital-light to capital-intensive, Goldman said. “The prospective return on this capital invested is likely to fade,” the researchers said. “Historically, it has been difficult for any firm to maintain high sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.” Despite doubts about whether these companies will be able to sustain their current levels over the coming years, Goldman does not believe the companies to be in a valuation bubble. In an earlier note, however, Goldman warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While the investment bank attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, strategists said a large portion of the uncertainty is again due to an “extremely high level of market concentration.” Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Investing.com -- Mizuho analysts raised their estimates and price target for Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), highlighting its increasing share in the AI server market as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads the charge toward a projected $2 trillion data center AI infrastructure (DCAI) opportunity by 2028-29. In their latest note, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) said NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and next-generation products, like the NVL72 and GB300A, are driving higher server average selling prices (ASPs) and reshaping the market landscape. "Dell is gaining share in AI servers as capex percolates and NVDA GPUs supply expands to Tier 2 CSPs and Enterprise/Sovereign customers," Mizuho stated, adding that this trend is expected to significantly boost Dell's position through 2025. The analysts emphasized the rapid adoption of NVIDIA's GPUs, including the ongoing Blackwell ramp, which could support NVIDIA's January quarter guidance. Mizuho projected that December/January shipments of 150,000-200,000 GB200 GPUs might add up to $7-8 billion in upside potential for NVIDIA's revenue. This momentum is seen as a "strong tailwind for Dell," as it positions itself as a key systems integrator in the evolving AI server market. Looking ahead, Mizuho highlighted a significant market expansion. "We estimate Tier 2 CSP and Enterprise/Sovereign accounting for ~48% of AI server spend by 2027E, out of the total estimated spend ~$300B, and growing at a 42% C24-27E CAGR," they wrote. This segment alone is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% between 2024 and 2027, out of a total estimated market spend of $300 billion. Dell's focus on competitive pricing and expanding GPU offerings are seen as positioning it well to capitalize on these shifts. Mizuho also flagged the potential for Dell to secure future orders from major players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the AI server market continues its rapid growth.

Title: Nvidia is having problems with its hot new AI chip as earning loom

After facing delays for its new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia (NVDA+4.84%) reportedly has a new problem — one that has its customers worried. The Information, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Nvidia has repeatedly asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected. Nvidia’s customers are reportedly worried about a delay for the server racks, which combine 72 of the AI chips in hope that larger AI models can be trained faster with more chips. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reports, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. On Sunday, Dell (DELL-0.05%) chief executive Michael Dell posted on X that Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks are shipping, and that Dell had delivered server racks to CoreWeave. “NVIDIA GB200 systems are the most advanced computers ever created. Integrating them into a diverse range of data center environments requires co-engineering with our customers,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While our customers race to be first to market, NVIDIA is working with leading CSPs as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.” Nvidia’s production and shipping delays for Blackwell were also caused by a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, Huang said. The chipmaker had to work with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.13%), to resolve the engineering setback. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Nvidia is set to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.93%). Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia stock was down by about 2.5% during Monday morning trading, but the shares are up about 187% so far this year.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on reports of Blackwell AI server issues ahead of earnings

Nvidia stock (NVDA) sank as much as 3.4% Monday before paring losses, following a new report from the Information highlighting overheating issues with its latest Blackwell artificial intelligence servers. The news comes ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings report, which is slated for release after the market close on Wednesday. It's not the first time issues have been reported with the company's Blackwell products. In August, the Information reported that the leading AI chipmaker was dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves. Nvidia confirmed fears that Blackwell production would be delayed in its earnings report in late August, stating that production of the chips would ramp up in the December quarter rather than its previously stated goal to ramp during the September period. The company has not publicly confirmed any design flaws or overheating issues. Nvidia told Yahoo Finance about its latest AI servers: "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Nvidia's so-called GB200 NVL72 server system uses 72 Blackwell chips and 36 of its latest Grace CPUs. Nvidia said the servers are "the most advanced computers ever created." Those Blackwell chips are set to bring in "several billion dollars" in sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Customers looking to use the Blackwell server system include Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Elon Musk's xAI, according to the Information. Despite reported issues, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell noted in a post on X Monday, following the Information's report, that Dell is already shipping an unspecified number of Nvidia's Blackwell servers as part of its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge System. Nvidia shares closed Monday down 1.3% to $140.15. As Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley noted last week, even a stellar report and outlook from the company Wednesday could send its stock down further. Nvidia topped expectations across the board in its most recent quarterly report, for example, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results in late August. Investor excitement over AI spending has also stoked fears Big Tech’s AI spending will ease — or sharply decline — punching AI chip companies in the gut. Such fears were on display last Friday, when chip stocks fell across the board after a disappointing earnings report from Applied Materials (AMAT), which makes tech used by TSMC (TSM) to manufacture advanced computing chips such as Nvidia’s. Nvidia shares closed Friday down 3.3%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell 3.4%. Still, Nvidia shares are up roughly 186% from last year. The chipmaker's monumental rise has pushed it past Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, and Nvidia recently replaced Intel on the Dow.

US stocks traded mixed on Monday amid fading optimism for interest-rate cuts, as investors looked ahead to Nvidia (NVDA) earnings to test the health of the AI trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was broadly flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.1%, buoyed by a jump in Tesla (TSLA) stock. Stocks are starting the week on the back foot as the prospect of higher-for-longer rates holds post-election bullishness in check.

Nvidia shares were down nearly 2% in early trading. Elsewhere in tech, EV maker Tesla's shares rose more than 5% in the wake of a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump's team is looking to ease US rules for self-driving vehicles.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.1% as Tesla (TSLA) jumped over the possibility of more relaxed autonomous driving rules under a Trump administration. Meanwhile, Nvidia will report earnings this Wednesday. On Monday, BofA analysts noted Nvidia "remains the most dominant stock in the market, driving 20% of S&P 500 return over the past year, and is expected drive nearly 25% of the S&P 500's EPS growth in 3Q."

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's Wednesday earnings report. The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (listen in below; video above). Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next twelve months given its wide lead on AI chip production. “The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.” Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong performance are expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock. Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a buy or strong buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels. "We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday. Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call," Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis said in a client note on Monday. Lipacis says if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth. There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late. In addition to achieving world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out. “It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors. One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write downs which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.” Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China. "The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said. Wall Street will be hard pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium-term. “The revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],” Bank of America analyst and Nvidia bull Vivek Arya told Sozzi on Opening Bid. Key drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call include coming next-generation AI chips — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in the third quarter of 2025 based on Arya's analysis. Grace L. Williams is a writer for Yahoo Finance.

Tariffs would have only a moderate and one-time effect that should not prevent inflation from continuing to fall, and their impact should be fairly easily identifiable in the component details, at least for tariffs on consumer goods. For all of these reasons, the impact on inflation need not be particularly significant for monetary policy, though this could change if the White House imposes a 10% universal tariff, which would push inflation just above 3%."

Title: Nvidia earnings are this week. Here's what Wall Street expects

Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA+4.84%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company’s shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results, the company’s shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. “The market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,” Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said “Nvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,” and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple’s (AAPL+0.11%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.18%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia’s technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.13%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell’s production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL+1.61%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.42%).

Bitcoin might be making headlines for hitting an all-time high after the U.S. presidential election, but an even more impressive success story is unfolding. While the world’s most popular cryptocurrency is nearing the $100,000 milestone, Nvidia NVDA has outperformed Bitcoin significantly over the past five years. Don't Miss: Bitcoin has had an incredible year. Since the 2024 presidential election, it has been on a rapid upward climb, recently hitting $93,434.36 and approaching the much-anticipated six-figure mark. Changing regulations, growing institutional interest and especially pro-crypto sentiments from the future U.S. leadership have all contributed to Bitcoin’s rise. Many analysts now expect it might hit $100,000 sooner rather than later and the enthusiasm is evident. Trending: ‘Scrolling Through UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. Valuation set to change next week but you can invest TODAY for just $0.25/share with a $1000 minimum. But while Bitcoin has been gaining attention, Nvidia’s stock has been outperforming it. On Nov. 14, Nvidia’s share price closed at $146.27, a staggering 2,768% increase over the previous five years. To put things in perspective, Bitcoin has increased by roughly 973% during that time, which is remarkable but still significantly less than Nvidia’s enormous growth. The tech sector now relies heavily on Nvidia. Their specialist chips have been in high demand as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a more important component of everything from data centers to consumer goods. The company has experienced exponential growth and its stock price has followed suit. See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Among Nvidia’s recent accomplishments is replacing Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This action emphasizes the continuous transition toward AI technology and firmly establishes Nvidia as a significant force in the tech sector. With a market cap of $3.43 trillion, Nvidia recently surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Analysts have remained bullish on Nvidia, citing its continued dominance in AI chips and the growth of AI technology overall. The company’s future looks bright, with analysts setting price targets that suggest even more upside potential for investors. Although Bitcoin’s ascent to its highest point in history is undoubtedly cause for celebration, Nvidia’s achievements over the last five years are truly remarkable. While both Nvidia and Bitcoin have provided investors with amazing profits, Nvidia has been one of the market leaders due to its steady expansion and rising product demand.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade — and the likes of Nvidia

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” Trump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He’s already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. During his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn’t say how much. The US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain—and America’s reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors. According to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips — central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. — came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a “major manufacturing disruption,” the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports. The CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike. Experts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump’s threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs. “Trump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that’s what he wants to be known for,” Newman told Yahoo Finance. But others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there’s a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs. If Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases. Newman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel’s (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers. For now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Taking Wall Street By Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm. xAI, the AI startup owned by Elon Musk, is raising more than $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, per a report by news platform CNBC. The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. CNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly. Trump plans on rebranding the CHIPS Act and repealing the Executive Order on AI, two major AI initiatives of US President Joe Biden. The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.

Title: Is AMD Stock Finally Better Than NVDA Stock After a 36% Decline?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-finally-better-nvda-142253161.html
Time Published: 2024-11-16T14:22:53Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has tumbled 36% from its 52-week high of $211 in March and trades around $135 as of writing. The decline has been driven by disappointing earnings and guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations. This dip has some investors wondering if now is the time to buy AMD on the cheap. However, a closer look at AMD's competitive position and growth prospects compared to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suggests the choice may not be so clear-cut. Before we get into why AMD stock declined, let's first take a glance at its Q3 results. However, the Q4 guidance disappointed analysts: Forecasted Q4 revenues between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, below the consensus estimate of $7.55 billion. This guidance miss caused a 13% stock drop over two trading days. These headwinds have soured market sentiment on AMD in the near term despite the company still growing revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q3. The question is whether the 36% pullback represents a buying opportunity for a quality company facing temporary issues or a sign of tougher times ahead. But first, let's look at what kind of competition AMD is facing. Nvidia is AMD's biggest competitor—we can all agree on that. That said, there are some differing opinions about how both companies could end up in the long run. Nvidia is focusing more on high-margin AI chips, whereas AMD is trying to undercut it and offer more value. I personally see it as something copied from AMD's playbook in the CPU market—where AMD slowly and methodically caught up to Intel—but it never managed to dominate it. Nvidia currently has an edge over AMD in the high-end GPU market. It has AI features like DLSS but, AMD offers very competitive performance for the price with its RX 7000 series, especially in the mid-range. Nvidia holds a clear lead with its GeForce RTX series—particularly the RTX 4090—in terms of raw gaming power and ray tracing capabilities. AMD’s Ryzen processors are highly competitive but do not challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU space. But again, this doesn't really matter much. Analysts care much more about dedicated AI products than anything related to gaming. Nvidia also leads here with its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which are widely adopted for large-scale AI training tasks. AMD’s Instinct MI300X is competitive but still lags behind Nvidia in terms of market share. Feature AMD Instinct MI300X Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU Memory Capacity 192GB HBM3 141GB HBM3e Memory Bandwidth 5.3TB/s 4.8TB/s Architecture AMD CDNA 3 Nvidia Hopper AI Performance (FP8) Up to 5,229 TFLOPS with sparsity Up to 3,958 TFLOPS with sparsity HPC Performance (FP64) Up to 81.72 TFLOPS Up to 34 TFLOPS Power Consumption (TDP) Up to 750W Up to 700W Target Use Case Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference Generative AI, HPC, AI training/inference AMD Instinct MI300X: The price of the AMD MI300X AI accelerator ranges between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the customer and volume of purchase. For instance, Microsoft reportedly pays around $10,000 per unit. Advantages: Higher memory capacity (192GB vs. Nvidia's 141GB). Solid for large-scale AI models like GPT-3 or PaLM. Greater memory bandwidth (5.3TB/s) allows faster data transfer for memory-intensive tasks. Superior peak theoretical performance in AI workloads, particularly in FP8 precision, making it highly efficient for large-scale generative AI tasks. Higher HPC performance in FP64 precision makes it more suitable for scientific simulations and other high-performance computing tasks. Disadvantages: Higher power consumption (750W vs. Nvidia’s 700W). But again, this can be offset by the lower cost of the chip itself. AMD’s ROCm software stack is still behind Nvidia’s CUDA in terms of maturity and optimization for AI workloads. This makes it harder for developers to switch from Nvidia’s established ecosystem. It also struggles with lower precision tasks like FP8. These are critical for AI training and inference. Nvidia’s H100 and H200 are better optimized here. Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU: The Nvidia H200 is priced significantly higher than the MI300X. It is estimated to cost around $30,000 to $40,000. Advantages: As I said, it has lower power consumption (700W). Strong inference performance, particularly in handling large language models like Llama2 with high throughput and efficiency. Better optimization for specific use cases like long input sequences and batch processing. Chatbots run a lot faster. Disadvantages: Lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the MI300X, which may limit its performance on extremely large models or memory-intensive tasks. Slightly lower peak theoretical performance in AI workloads compared to the MI300X. Feature/Aspect AMD Upcoming Products Nvidia Upcoming Products Key Consumer CPUs Ryzen X3D Processors GeForce RTX 50-Series (Blackwell) Expected Release Date January CES 2025 January-March CES/Q1-2025 Performance Expectations Significant gaming performance boost via X3D cache technology A major leap in ray tracing and CUDA core count; GDDR7 memory for higher bandwidth Key Data Center GPUs Instinct MI325X Blackwell-based AI GPUs Memory Bandwidth Up to 6TB/s (HBM3e) Expected improvements over Hopper architecture From what I can see: AMD’s MI325X will bring higher memory capacity and bandwidth, making it a strong contender against Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell-based GPUs. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem will probably still give it an edge. It'll cost much more, though. Blackwell B100 could cost $30,000 to $35,000, whereas MI325X is estimated to be around $15,000-$20,000. Nvidia's GB200 Superchip could be even more expensive around $60,000 to $70,000. AMD is "closing" the gap with its upcoming releases—especially in the data center segment—but Nvidia remains dominant across both consumer and enterprise markets right now. I really don't see it changing anytime soon. Why? Nvidia’s CUDA software ecosystem is a major reason customers stick with Nvidia GPUs. CUDA has become the industry standard for AI development. Switching from CUDA to AMD's ROCm involves significant effort and retraining of teams, and AMD will have to work overtime to convince customers to do that. Nvidia is growing faster and is more profitable than AMD. Last quarter (Q2), Nvidia grew revenue by 122.4% to $30 billion with a 55.3% net margin. AMD currently has an 11.31% net margin in Q3, and the gap will likely widen once Nvidia reports Q3 figures next week. Here's what you should know for now: Note: Q3 numbers for Nvidia are estimates, as per my research. Valuation is more subjective these days as AI has thrown a curveball into how Wall Street slaps a premium on certain companies. AMD is—and probably will be—valued less than Nvidia, both in terms of market cap and how the broader market sees it. Thus, AMD stock trading at 28 times forward earnings against Nvidia's 38 times forward earnings doesn't necessarily make it cheaper. In fact, I would argue that AMD fares worse here. A lower P/E ratio does not necessarily mean better value. Nvidia’s higher multiple is justified by its dominance in AI chips and its rapid revenue growth in this segment. Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion annually within five years. In contrast, AMD is still playing catch-up in AI—as we looked at before. What do analysts say? Nonetheless, I still don't think AMD is a "better" choice per se. Nvidia has been surprising analysts again and again in the past few quarters. Unless that changes in the coming quarter(s), I don't think AMD stock offers more value compared to NVDA stock. In terms of pure value—considering upside potential relative to the current price—AMD stock appears to offer more value than NVDA stock at this moment. NVDA stock remains an excellent long-term play for those focused on stability and leadership in AI, but—if you take price targets seriously—AMD stock provides a better risk-reward balance for investors willing to bet on its continued progress in catching up with Nvidia. In my opinion, you should hold both if you want exposure to AI, but NVDA stock should comprise more of that pie. While I acknowledge the potential of both AMD and NVDA as AI plays, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: SPLG: This Could Be an Ideal ETF for New Investors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market’s best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I’m bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.’s best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we’ll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a “low-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.” State Street also explains that SPLG is “one of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.” This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG’s holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which “represents approximately 80% of the US market.” This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out—rather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPLG’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. It’s worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG’s top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can’t necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you’ll find in today’s market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It’s hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG’s 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it’s still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500’s valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America’s strongest companies, and it’s difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I’m bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.

Title: xAI's value is set to double, joining Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX in reaching new heights

Two of Elon Musk’s private ventures are set to be worth a lot more, joining his sole public company in securing massive valuations. His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, CNBC reports, citing anonymous sources. Five billion dollars are expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East, while the remainder comes from domestic investors. The Financial Times previously reported that Musk had approached investors in Qatar and Saudi Arabia about backing the startup, which he launched last July as a competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI, as well as current investors like Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners. At the time, a $45 billion valuation had been floated. If the deal closes, it would more than double the $24 billion valuation xAI reached in May, when the company announced it had raised $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. The new funds are expected to go toward the acquisition of 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA+4.84%) chips, CNBC reports. xAI in October won approval to expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is expected to help train Tesla’s (TSLA+2.13%) AI tech, including Full Self-Driving. And SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company that plans to test a mega-rocket on Monday, is also looking to raise cash. The largest private company in the U.S. plans to launch a tender offer next month to sell existing shares at about $135 a pop, according to the Times, citing people who are knowledgeable about the discussions. With that reported offer, SpaceX would be valued at $250 billion, up from $210 billion earlier this year. It would also make it worth more than Bytedance, the company behind TikTok and the most valuable startup in the world. Both startups are likely to benefit from Musk’s tight-knit relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, who on Tuesday handed Musk an advisory board to recommend ways to slash regulations and federal spending. He’s already signaled that he will use that job to try and benefit his companies. On Friday, he agreed with investor Ron Baron’s comments that regulations should be changed so that companies don’t need to repeatedly get permits to launch rockets. He previously said he would work to streamline federal regulations for driverless vehicles, which Tesla is working on. Musk is widely expected to play a role in guiding the Trump administration’s AI initiatives. It’s easier to see what effect that relationship has on Tesla, given that it’s a public company. Since its CEO’s big bet on Trump paid off, the stock has boomed, reaching a $1 trillion valuation and surging above $300 per share for the first time since 2022. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its third quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the artificial intelligence trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia’s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter. Even if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results. That could have been a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time. Investors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is also facing an uncertain future, with Donald Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. The president-elect has also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Jefferies: Wall Street’s Expectation That NVIDIA Would Earn $200 Billion In Revenue In 2025 Assumes “Overly Aggressive ASPs”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. A hint of circumspection around NVIDIA appears to be creeping into the commentaries of the more discerning financial powerhouses that populate Wall Street. Consider the latest investment note from Jefferies, where the financial advisory firm adopts a markedly cautious tone vis-à-vis NVIDIA's prospects for 2025. A few weeks back, Morgan Stanley saw NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, and between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25. Fast-forward to this week, when Raymond James noted that it now saw NVIDIA shipping "around 100,000 Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which is likely at the lower end of investor expectations." The investment bank, however, was decidedly bullish on NVIDIA's 2025 prospects: "That said, we anticipate an acceleration in Blackwell ramps in 1H25, with strong demand extending through 2025." Today, it is the turn of analysts at Jefferies to expound on NVIDIA's near-term prospects. Jefferies Raises $NVDA PT to $185 from $150, Maintains Buy Rating Analyst Comments: "We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range. While expectations continue to creep higher, we believe the stock continues to work as we are in… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) November 15, 2024 To wit, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis begins by reiterating that he expects the high-flying maker of GPUs to repeat the story that has consistently played out over the past few quarters, replete "with a beat and raise in the $2B range." Curtis notes that Wall Street expects NVIDIA to earn at least $200 billion in revenue and $5 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, with some estimates reaching as high as $6 in EPS. The Jefferies analyst then notes: "While we are positive on unit upside, many of these estimates might be assuming overly aggressive ASPs, stemming from misconceptions that NVDA would sell entire racks for the GB200 NVL." Curtis expects NVIDIA to ship ~6 million GPUs in 2025, which is lower than most estimates on Wall Street: "Our roughly 6M GPU unit assumption implies DC revenue closer to $180-200B compared to buyside expectations in the $205-215B range." Despite his cautious tone, Curtis remains bullish on the GPU manufacturer's prospects, as evidenced by his reiteration of a 'Buy' rating for the stock with a target of $185 per share, up from an earlier peg at $150. "Blackwell is starting to ramp, with a 'few billion' this quarter and further growth as small volumes of the GB200 layer in next quarter. Hopper is still growing during this transition as prior deployments are filled out. We raise our estimates to reflect our updated expectations for the Blackwell ramp." NVIDIA shares are down ~2 percent at the time of writing. Year to date, the stock is up a whopping 200 percent.
