Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/19/this-is-not-broadcoms-nvidia-moment-yet/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T21:05:23Z
Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Micron stock (MU) plummeted more than 16% Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter despite burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence chips. The memory chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) as a major customer, said Wednesday it expects revenue between $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to guide for revenue of $9 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Micron’s outlook points to a trend across the chip industry: Sales of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence are growing quickly, while traditional chip sales slump. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units), which hyperscalers use in data centers to power both their customers' and their own artificial intelligence workloads. Blackwell demand is expected to soar in the upcoming year. CEO of Micron Technology Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement Wednesday that data center revenue, which includes Micron's memory chips used in GPUs, grew to more than 50% of the company's total revenue for the first time in its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 28. Meanwhile, its “consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term." For example, Micron said that while its HBM chips revenue rose more than 50% in the November quarter, revenue from its chips for mobile phones fell 19%. Mehrotra said Micron is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy following its earnings results and outlook. Arya said Micron's growing revenue from sales of its memory chips for AI isn't enough to offset pressures from weak demand for those used in personal computers and smartphones. Analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan, Raymond James, and TD Cowen, also lowered their price targets on the stock but kept their Buy ratings. While Micron said weak demand in the PC market is taking longer than expected to pick up, it pointed to a surging AI market opportunity for its HBM semiconductors used in AI chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Micron said it projects the market for HBM to grow to $30 billion in 2025, up from its prior forecast of $25 billion. The chipmaker sees its own HBM revenue soaring from several hundred million dollars in its fiscal year 2024 to multiple billions of dollars in 2025. “Perhaps what was most surprising is not MU's guidance, but the stock reaction AH [after the market close] given the well-understood weakness in near-term memory pricing,” TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note Thursday. Sankar reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $135. Micron shares stood at $87 at the market close Thursday. For its fiscal first quarter, Micron's earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the expected $1.76, while its revenue of $8.7 billion was in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We reported a few months back how NVIDIA's H100 GPUs, which remain under a strict US export control regime in relation to China, were readily accessible via Super Micro Computer's dealers within the Asian giant. Well, this issue has finally caught the attention of the authorities in the US. U.S. PROBES $NVDA CHIP SMUGGLING TO CHINA: INFORMATION The Commerce Dept has asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips ended up in China despite export restrictions, per The Information. NVIDIA instructed major distributors, including Supermicro and Dell, to conduct spot checks… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 19, 2024 To wit, The Information is now reporting that the US Commerce Department has formally asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips that remain subject to export controls were ending up in China. For its part, NVIDIA has asked its major distributors, including Super Micro Computer and Dell, to conduct spot checks on their regional customers. NVIDIA is particularly concerned as to how some of the end-users in China were purportedly able to forge server serial numbers to circumvent the restrictions imposed under the prevailing US export controls. Back in April, our own search on Baidu had yielded a number of posts, including one which promised a large shipment of NVIDIA's H100 chips "arriving in Hong Kong in two weeks, and can be picked up in Shenzhen or Zhengzhou." Some of the posts also included data sheets bearing Super Micro Computer's logo. Similarly, a post on ZOL at the time also referenced a promotion of H100 chips from Super Micro Computer. The listing on Zol is still easily accessible but whether the GPUs are with the poster cannot be verified. Of course, this development comes as the relation between NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer appear somewhat strained. Digi Times reported back in November that NVIDIA was redirecting some of its orders that were originally placed with SMCI to other suppliers. Similarly, during Super Micro Computer's Q1'25 earnings call, when asked by an analyst as to when Blackwell revenues would start showing up in SMCI's books, the company's CEO Charles Liang had bemoaned that "we are asking NVIDIA every day [for those chips]." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Hindenburg Research had leveled damning allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, detailing a litany of malpractices at the firm. Those allegations had then prompted the firm to delay the filing of its annual report for FY 2024 and the quarterly financial statements for Q1 2025. The Nasdaq exchange then concluded that this inordinate delay was inconsistent with its listing requirements. However, on the 06th of December, Nasdaq accepted Super Micro Computer's plan to regain compliance with the exchange's listing requirements, and granted a reprieve until the 25th of February 2025. Meanwhile, SMCI's relentless share price plunge has been sufficient to push the stock out of the Nasdaq 100 index. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Commerce has recently asked Nvidia to look into how the company's products ended up in China over the past year, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person close to the department. The chip giant has asked big distributors such as Super Micro Computer and Dell Technologies to conduct spot checks of their customers in Southeast Asia, the report said. Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips are embedded in server products made by Super Micro and Dell. The Information reported that five different people involved in smuggling Nvidia chips said they have managed so far to evade detection during recent inspections by Super Micro. "We insist that our customers and partners strictly adhere to all export control restrictions. Any unauthorized deviation of previously-owned products, including any grey market resales, would be a burden on our business, not a benefit," an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed response. Some of the customers duplicated serial numbers of the servers containing Nvidia chips that they purchased from Super Micro and attached them to other servers that they had access to, the report said, citing a person close to Super Micro. In some cases, smugglers even altered the serial numbers in the operating system for the servers, the report said. Dell said the company requires its distributors and resellers to follow all applicable regulations and export controls. The company added that it takes appropriate action "up to and including termination" of its relationship if a partner is not adhering to these obligations. Super Micro said it investigates and takes action against any unauthorized exports or re-exports of its products by third parties. "Supermicro follows all U.S. export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses under the Export Administration Regulations," the company told Reuters. The commerce department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Joe Biden administration has doubled down on its chip crackdown in China. The U.S. broadened a ban on the sale of high-end AI chips to the country last year. Still, several Chinese universities and research institutes procured these Nvidia chips via resellers, a Reuters review of tender documents showed earlier in 2024. Earlier this month, the U.S. curbed semiconductor exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday finalized an award to SK Hynix of up to $458 million in government grants to help fund an advanced chip packaging plant and research and development facility for artificial intelligence products in Indiana. In April, the Nvidia supplier said it would invest $3.87 billion to build the West Lafayette facility which will include an assembly line to mass produce next-generation high bandwidth memory chips. The chips are used in graphic processing units that train artificial intelligence systems. The department also plans to make available $500 million in government loans for the SK Hynix project. The grant funds would be distributed when SK Hynix meets project milestones. The project will create 1,000 jobs and fill a key gap in the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, the department said. Kwak Noh-Jung, CEO of the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said in a statement the company looks forward to working "to build a robust and resilient AI semiconductor supply chain in the U.S." Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority. The Commerce Department is awarding major grants to all five leading semiconductor manufacturers - TSMC, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Micron and SK Hynix. The department has now finalized all of those but the $6.4 billion Samsung award. This month it finalized a $75 million award to Absolics for constructing a facility in Georgia to supply advanced materials to the country's semiconductor industry. Absolics is an affiliate of SKC, which in turn is part of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate SK Group, as is SK Hynix.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA, Financials) in the year thus far is up approximately 182% on last look, positioning it at the forefront of U.S.-listed semiconductor companies. Its developments in artificial intelligence technologiesincluding the H100 Tensor Core GPUs necessary for training big language models like ChatGPT and the RTX 40 Series GPUs targeted at gamers and creative professionalshelp to explain this spike. Strategic alliances with big cloud companies such Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have strengthened Nvidia's market share even further. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. With profits of $18.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, Nvidia recorded a 206% annual year-over-year (YoY) net income of $9.2 billion, up 472% YoY. Especially, data center goods generated more than 70% of this income, which emphasizes the company's emphasis on artificial intelligence-driven applications. With a YTD increase of around 114%, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO, Financials) has also seen notable expansion. Tomahawk 5 Ethernet devices and the company's own application-specific integrated circuits have driven data center workloads in considerable part. In the fourth quarter of 2024 Broadcom disclosed revenue of $9.8 billion, a 15% YoY increase, and net income of $3.7 billion; the company forecasts $3 billion in revenue from AI-related products for the fiscal year 2024. About 92.5% YTD increase has been recorded by Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials).

Since bursting into the A.I. scene five years ago, the Canadian startup Cohere has emerged as a rival to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Backed by tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Salesforce, it’s managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster its mission to develop A.I. models for enterprises. Cohere’s partners include software giant Oracle, Japanese telecom company Fujitsu and, as first reported by TechCrunch this week, the data analytics company Palantir. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Founded more than two decades ago by Peter Thiel, Palantir provides data analytics software for major businesses and government agencies. While Cohere has yet to officially announce the partnership, a segment during Palantir’s developer conference in November detailed its work with the startup, which has already seen Cohere’s models deployed to Palantir customers. Cohere and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. Cohere’s partnership with Palantir appears to focus on Palantir’s Foundry platform, which serves corporate clients. Billy Trend, a senior software engineer at Cohere, noted his excitement “about working with Palantir” during the conference. He discussed the startup’s engagement with an unnamed Palantir customer who had “strict constraints” on data storage and was looking to conduct its inference in Arabic—a task Trend described as “a great opportunity” for Cohere’s multilingual capabilities. Headquartered in Toronto and San Francisco, Cohere was established in 2019 by former Google researchers Nick Frosst, Ivan Zhang and Aiden Gomez. Gomez notably co-authored the 2017 “Attention is All You Need Paper,” which led to pivotal breakthroughs in machine learning. Instead of pushing consumer products or advancements in artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.) research like its competitors, Cohere has positioned itself as a startup focused on building tailored models for enterprise clients like McKinsey and Deloitte. Its low-profile strategy has attracted the attention of corporate investors like Cisco, AMD and Fujitsu, all of whom participated in a $500 million funding round in July that valued the startup at $5.5 billion—more than doubling its previous valuation of $2.1 billion a year earlier. Other backers of Cohere include renowned A.I. academics Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li. Some of Cohere’s largest competitors have becoming increasingly cozy with defense clients in recent months. In November, Palantir announced plans to team up with Anthropic and Amazon (AMZN) in a partnership that will provide Anthropic’s A.I. models to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Earlier this month, OpenAI inked a military deal with the defense company Anduril that will see its technology infused into anti-drone systems. Between August of 2022 and 2023, the value of A.I.-related federal contracts soared 150 percent to a staggering $675 million, according to a study from the Brookings Institute.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.96%) stock climbed during Wednesday morning trading after slumping into correction territory earlier in the week. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 3.5% before noon Wednesday after falling into a correction at market close Monday. Nvidia’s shares continued falling by almost 3% Tuesday. The company’s shares are up by 180% so far this year. Meanwhile, rival chip designer Broadcom (AVGO+3.63%) closed up more than 11% Monday after it soared 20% Friday to surpass the $1 trillion market cap for the first time. The chipmaker reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue for the fourth quarter ended in November. On the company’s earnings call, Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan said it sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote that Broadcom was having an “Nvidia moment” in a Monday note, reported by MarketWatch. Rasgon noted “a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out.” However, Broadcom’s stock fell by more than 5% Tuesday, and its shares were down by more than 3% during Wednesday morning trading. The chipmaker’s shares are up by almost 103% so far this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT-0.20%) reportedly bought twice as many of Nvidia’s Hopper chips as its rivals this year. The tech giant is estimated to have bought 485,000 of the chips — more than double Nvidia’s second-largest U.S. customer, Meta (META-0.11%), which bought 224,000, the Financial Times reported, citing analysts at technology consultancy Omdia. The analysts estimate Amazon (AMZN+0.46%) bought 196,000 Hopper chips, and Google (GOOGL+1.86%) bought 169,000.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indices declined sharply after the Federal Open Market Committee announced a quarter percentage point reduction in interest rates on Wednesday afternoon and just two more interest rate cuts in 2025. With that, the Dow had its first ten-day losing streak, the longest since 1974. In its final interest rate decision of the year, the Fed implemented its third consecutive cut, bringing the interest rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. “Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,” the FOMC said in a statement. “Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.” The central bank indicated that it could carry out just two more reductions to the federal funds rate in 2025, given quarter-point cuts, according to its updated Summary of Economic Projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell similarly signaled that the Fed will take a “more cautious” approach to monetary policy next year. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a press conference Wednesday. “And as long as the economy in the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Powell said that the decision to cut rates was a “closer call” than previous reductions, but that the FOMC ultimately decided it was “the right call” to balance inflation and labor market goals. After the market closed, the Dow was down over 1,100 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Moreover, Nvidia (NVDA+1.96%) stock, which declined earlier this week, bounced back on Wednesday. Micron Technology (MU+2.55% is set to announce its quarterly results after the closing bell. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA has reigned uncontested over the AI chip sphere for far too long. However, now it seems that some much-needed competition is finally putting up a challenge to the GPU manufacturer's full-spectrum dominance over this critical arena. OMDIA: $GOOGL'S TPU DEMAND GROWS, CHALLENGING $NVDA'S AI CHIP DOMINANCE Omdia research shows surging demand for Google's TPU chips, with estimates suggesting they could account for $6B–$9B in Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue this year. At even $6B, TPU shipments are growing… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 To wit, Omdia Research has now published its fresh take on the dynamics within the AI chip sphere, noting that Goggle's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could account for between $6 billion and $9 billion in AI-related sales for Broadcom this year. As a refresher, Broadcom is currently developing custom AI chips (ASICs) for three major customers: Google, Meta, and ByteDance. The company is also developing next-gen AIXPUs with two other clients. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, many cloud providers have begun preferring custom chips or ASICs over NVIDIA's GPUs due to the former's cost advantage over the latter, which enables cost-effective optimization of internal workloads. As per Morgan Stanley's estimates, the custom AI chip market - driven primarily by cloud providers - will grow from $120 billion in 2024 to $300 billion by 2027, outpacing the growth rate for the GPU market. Coming back, Omdia believes that even if Broadcom's TPU shipments for 2024 ultimately clock-in at $6 billion, which constitutes the low-end of the research firm's estimated range, they would still be significant enough to dent NVIDIA's AI chip market share! Looking ahead, Omdia continues to see TPU-powered AI products driving broad-based growth for Google Cloud. $NVDA +2.75% [Microsoft bought twice as many of Nvidia’s flagship chips as any of its largest rivals in the U.S. and China this year, per FT. Analysts at Omdia, a technology consultancy, estimate that $MSFT bought 485K of Nvidia’s “Hopper” chips this year. That put Microsoft far… — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) December 18, 2024 Of course, this does not mean that NVIDIA is about to cede its market dominance anytime soon. As an illustration, Omdia notes elsewhere that Microsoft bought a whopping 485,000 units of NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs in 2024, while Meta bought another 224,000 units of these last-gen chips. Meanwhile, NVIDIA continues to prepare the ground for its next-gen Blackwell GPUs to take volume leadership from the older Hopper chips. Citi on $NVDA (Buy; PT $175): 'Recent custom ASIC chipmakers’ $MRVL and $AVGO strong results are stirring up new investor questions on the old 'GPU vs Custom ASIC' debate. As highlighted in our recent report, we expect both to coexist with the software reprogrammability to… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 Meanwhile, Citi expects the AI chip sphere to grow to a TAM of $380 billion by 2028, where AI GPUs (read NVIDIA) control 75 percent of the market while ASICs account for the residual 25 percent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s the holiday season! We have two consecutive short trading weeks on the way, with Christmas and New Years around the corner. I'm examining the historical data on how stocks tend to perform these weeks. Then I’m going to look at the actual Santa Claus Rally as it was officially defined. Finally, I’ll list some individual stocks to keep an eye on during the most wonderful time of the year. The table below summarizes weekly returns for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) over the past 50 years. Certain years, traders don’t get a day off for New Year’s so that’s why there’s less than 50 New Year’s weeks. Buyers seem to stick around on the holidays as these have been bullish weeks for stocks. The SPX averages a 0.55% return during the week of Christmas with 62% of the returns positive. New Year’s has done even better averaging a return of 0.66%. These holiday weeks easily beat the typical weekly return for the SPX of 0.17%. The general outperformance for stocks at the end of year is often casually referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. According to Investopedia, however, the term was first used in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, the founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. He defined the Santa Claus Rally as the first two trading days of the New Year along with the last five trading days of the previous year. So, let’s look at how these specific seven trading days have performed over the past 50 years. This has indeed been a bullish time. The S&P 500 has averaged a return of more than 1% with positive returns 74% of the time during these seven trading days. The typical 7-day return for the index was 0.26% with 58% of the returns positive. This next table lists the S&P 500 stocks which have performed the best during the Santa Claus Rally over the past 10 years (sorted by percent positive then average return). Newmont (NEM) tops the list averaging a return of more than 4% with 90% of the returns positive. I see a few real estate names and healthcare companies, but no sector is dominating the list. Finally, there have been stocks that underperform during this time. This next table shows the worst performing S&P 500 stocks during the Santa Claus Rally timeframe. CME Group (CME) tops this list, finishing positive just one time out of 10 during these seven trading days. Interestingly, some mega-cap stocks show up on this list including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL). A decent number of information technology companies have performed poorly showing up in the table below. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Big Tech is dominating the market once again — and that's probably just fine: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings December is shaping up to be a tale of two markets. On the one hand, the Dow (^DJI) just suffered its worst day in a month, capping a nine-day losing streak — its longest since 1978. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) notched six record highs this month, including one on Monday. Investors can thank the $1.2 trillion worth of value that was added this month to the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA). Since the election, their market capitalization has surged by $1.8 trillion, led by Tesla's stunning $680 billion gain. Even more remarkable: This rally comes despite Nvidia shedding $200 billion over the same period. But investor concerns about the narrowing rally are nothing new. Since this bull market began two years ago, the S&P 500 has tacked on $22 trillion in market capitalization, of which the Mag Seven stocks have contributed a cool $10 trillion, or 45%. Each time the Mag Seven shows its dominance in the market, headlines trumpet comparisons to the late 1990s dot-com bubble, implying doom. But each time in this rally, other areas of the market have picked up and asserted themselves — while the tech stocks themselves have continued to do well. Even when the Mag Seven index itself fell into a bear market in July, the damage to the S&P 500 was limited to a 9% drop. At the time, utilities, real estate, and consumer staples cushioned the fall — a classic case of "defensive" sectors earning their moniker. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, is fond of saying, "Rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets." But when massive amounts of cash on the sidelines are being tapped, that can indicate Keynes's animal spirits at work. And BofA just reported the biggest drop in cash allocation since April 2001, a sign of "super-bullish sentiment." Amid the uber-risk-on sentiment, cash is disappearing from portfolios at a record pace. The latest reading shows the allocation to cash by fund managers dropping to net 14% underweight — the lowest level since at least 2011 and the sharpest decline in five years. And that level of sentiment is the proverbial fly in the ointment. BofA ominously highlights prior periods when cash allocation dropped to a similar degree: the first quarter of 2002, in the midst of a nasty bear market that would wipe 50% off the S&P 500, and February 2011, just prior to a near-20% drop in the index. As the analysts wrote, "previous lows in cash allocation coincided with big tops in risk assets."

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

Title: Why the Dow is suddenly in a historic funk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on its worst losing streak in nearly 50 years. The major index has fallen for nine straight trading days, its largest stretch of consecutive declines since 1978. The move lower in the Dow comes as large-cap tech has largely been holding up the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) throughout December. The Dow's losses amount to roughly 3%, or more than 1,500 points, in the past nine trading sessions. The index has fallen from a record close of 45,014 on Dec. 4 to 43,499 as of Tuesday's close. In that same time frame, the S&P 500 is down about 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up almost 2%. Given the Dow's construction, it's not benefitting from the tech rally. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, just four — Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. This means the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, hasn't benefitted from massive rallies in Tesla (TSLA), which is up more than 37% in the past 10 days, or Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), which has risen 14% in the same time period. Instead, the Dow has been pulled down, partly due to the recent sell-off in Nvidia stock. The blue-chip index added Nvidia on Nov. 8. Since then, one of the hottest stocks in the market has cooled off, with shares down nearly 12%. "It's really the tech leadership versus everything else, value versus growth," WisdomTree global chief investment officer Jeremy Schwartz told Yahoo Finance. A sell-off in healthcare stocks has also weighed on the Dow. UnitedHealth (UNH) is down about 20% in the past 10 days following the murder of its CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4. Other healthcare stocks have also lagged, with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN) both down more than 4% in the past 10 trading sessions. Schwartz said the Dow's decline hasn't been surprising given the run-up in stocks this year, though. "We are still optimistic for next year. We think stocks versus bonds is still [the place] to be in the markets," he said. "But there was so much strong positioning for this rally and for this seasonal rally that it's not actually a surprise to see this pullback." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Stock market today: Dow logs longest losing streak since 1978 as stocks slide ahead of Fed decision

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the session down roughly 0.6%, registering its ninth straight day of losses. The last 9-day losing streak for the Dow was Feb. 1978. Prior to that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. The other major indexes dropped in tandem on Tuesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) losing about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Fed policymakers kicked off their final gathering of the year earlier in the trading day, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares closed down over 1%. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Prices retreated to just above $106,500 a coin. US stocks closed down across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index fell roughly 0.6% to register its ninth straight day of losses. The last time that happened was February 1978. The other major indexes also finished the session lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. December’s market action has been all about a rally from several members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) all hit fresh record highs on Monday. Even on a day like Tuesday, where all three major indexes were in the red, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) hit a record high. While each individual stock has its own potential story working for it — like Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ties with Donald Trump sparking a post-election rally — market strategists believe there is also a broader theme at play: The Magnificent Seven have become a place to hide when the direction of the macro narrative becomes uncertain. "When you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a 'defensive,'" Citi head of us equity strategy Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. The large-cap bias among investors has come as markets have moved to expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than previously anticipated over the next year amid signs of sticky inflation and solid economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on pace for its longest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index slid about 0.8% by afternoon trade on Tuesday, coming off an eighth straight day of losses. The last nine-day losing streak for the Dow was February 1978. Before that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the biggest loser within the Dow, falling over 3%. Goldman Sachs (GS), Salesforce (CRM), and Nvidia (NVDA) followed, each down about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock recovered from earlier losses but still traded down over 1% Tuesday as investors grew cautious the AI spending that fueled its rise could ease or spread to rivals. Shares of the AI chipmaker have fallen over 10% since reaching a record closing high of $148.88 in early November. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia made a swift ascent to the top, from a graphics card company primarily used for video games to the world’s leading supplier of AI chips, as Big Tech goes all-in on generative artificial intelligence. In 2024, it traded places with Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company, and in early November, it replaced the once-dominant Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note last week he expects Nvidia’s market cap to surpass $4 trillion in 2025. But following its record close in November, Nvidia shares began to fall after commentary from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. Rumors of overheating issues with its latest Blackwell AI servers stoked fears of further delays to the production ramp-up, sending shares down even more. Even Nvidia’s most recent blowout earnings report, which surpassed bullish analysts’ already-high expectations, did little to help the stock's trajectory. Adding to Nvidia’s troubles, China’s competition authority last week said it has launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia’s $7 billion acquisition of networking technology company Mellanox. Meanwhile, the competition is heating up, with companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Broadcom (AVGO) developing and rolling out their own respective chips. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices surged to another record on Tuesday, briefly touching above $108,000 early Tuesday before retreating to just around $107,000 by mid-afternoon. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has enjoyed a sizable rally following Donald Trump's presidential win, rising over 50% since that time. Trump's win pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs in the immediate aftermath of the election, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who announced he would step down on Jan. 20. Despite bitcoin's moves to the upside on Tuesday, other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names moved lower. Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell about 1% to trade above $3,900 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, dropped around 4%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, saw shares fall roughly 1%. Bank of America's latest fund manager's survey could be summed in up three words from BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett: "super-bullish sentiment." Respondents are bullish about US stocks, flashing the largest percentage of respondents overweight US equities on record. They're bullish about equities in general, with global risk appetite at a three-year high and investors' allocation to cash sitting at a three-year low. And they're increasingly bullish that the global economy won't enter recession in 2025. Just 6% of respondents said they see a "hard landing" — where higher rates help tip the economy into an outright downturn — in the next 12 months. This marked the lowest number of respondents to call for a hard landing in six months. This reflects the broad consensus on Wall Street that, at least in the US, above-trend growth is largely expected in 2025. But as we wrote in Tuesday's Morning Brief, when everyone's on one side of an argument, it often raises eyebrows from strategists and economists. "My concern dial has gone up a little bit," Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning. "Two years ago, back in 2022, I recall the consensus was largely on the recession train for the coming year (I took the other side) even though labor markets were fine and homebuilding stocks were outperforming despite rate hikes. "Today, the consensus is fairly sanguine on growth next year. However, labor markets have been cooling and homebuilding stocks are presently underperforming despite rate cuts. I see myself on the more cautious side of the consensus at present." Telsa (TSLA) — now less than $100 billion away from eclipsing the market cap of Facebook owner Meta (META) — continued to enjoy a massive rally on Tuesday. Shares of the EV maker rose as much as 4.5%, boosting its market cap to around $1.54 trillion. The uptick in the stock price comes after Mizuho upgraded the company to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $515 a share, up from the prior $230. The firm cited a looser regulatory framework as a tailwind for shares in 2025 following Donald Trump's presidential win. Musk, a close ally of Trump, will co-head the new "Department of Government Efficiency" in the president-elect's second term. Meta, which has a market cap of about $1.57 trillion, fell nearly 1% in late morning trade. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade before bouncing off of its session lows. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade," per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement. “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz wrote, "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.5%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5%. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday. November retail sales grew at a faster pace than Wall Street analysts had expected, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer and indicating that the holiday shopping season in the US is off to a strong start. Retail sales rose 0.7% in November. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in October were revised up to a 0.5% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. A 2.4% month-over-month increase in motor vehicle and auto parts sales, as well as a 1.8% increase in online sales, drove the gains. November sales, excluding auto and gas, rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. The control group in Tuesday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the Gross Domestic Product reading for the quarter, increased by 0.4%, in line with estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Tuesday despite upbeat retail sales data as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting expected to usher in an interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.7%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Markets are waiting for Fed policymakers to kick off their final gathering of the year, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares fell over 2% in late morning trade. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade" per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz writes: "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.5%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5%. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday. November retail sales grew at a faster pace than Wall Street analysts had expected, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer and indicating that the holiday shopping season in the US is off to a strong start. Retail sales rose 0.7% in November. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in October were revised up to a 0.5% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. A 2.4% month-over-month increase in motor vehicle and auto parts sales, as well as a 1.8% increase in online sales, drove the gains. November sales, excluding auto and gas, rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. The control group in Tuesday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the Gross Domestic Product reading for the quarter, increased by 0.4%, in line with estimates.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Title: Nvidia stock slumps into a correction — while Broadcom basks in its own 'Nvidia moment'

Nvidia (NVDA+1.96%) stock is in correction territory, and rival chipmaker Broadcom’s (AVGO+3.63%) late-year boost took a hit Tuesday morning. Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA+0.94%). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ has arrived. Now it needs to deliver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: AMD Is Pouring Cash Into A.I. Startups: Companies It Has Backed So Far

AMD (AMD), a Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker that has benefited generously from the A.I. boom, is pouring some of its newfound cash into generative A.I. startups. AMD’s newest A.I. bet is on Liquid AI, a startup established last year by MIT researchers that aims to create cost-effective A.I. models. The chipmaker’s investment arm led the startup’s recent $250 million funding round, which included investors like OSS Capital and Duke Capital Partners and reportedly values the startup at more than $2 billion.

You can opt out anytime. Unlike the traditional neural networks underpinning A.I. systems, which model the human brain, Liquid AI is focused on a new type of A.I. model that takes inspiration from the smaller brains of worms and requires significantly less compute and energy. “Liquid AI’s unique approach to developing efficient AI models will push the boundaries of A.I., making it far more accessible,” said Mathew Hein, chief strategy officer of corporate development at AMD, in a statement. The Liquid AI investment marks the ninth A.I. bet placed by AMD Ventures in 2024 alone, according to data from Crunchbase. And it isn’t just the chipmaker’s venture division that has been ramping up its work with startups. Of the 12 investments by AMD since 2000, half were made in the past four years. “We’ve decided to become much more active in how we’re working on this,” said Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, during a recent podcast interview. In light of A.I.’s rapid advancement, even large enterprises that were previously “more conservative with working with startups are also becoming much more open,” added Su. “Nobody wants to be behind in A.I.” Earlier this month, AMD Ventures participated in a $155 million funding round for Ayar Labs, a startup developing A.I. chips that transmit data to each other with light. Other investments made in 2024 benefited the likes of Cohere, a Canadian startup specializing in A.I. models for enterprises, and the data-labeling Scale AI. In September, AMD became one of the backers behind World Labs, a venture established by acclaimed A.I. academic Fei-Fei Li that aims to create A.I. models able to navigate and reason with the 3D world. AMD company-wide investments, meanwhile, have focused on A.I.-centered companies like the GPU cloud platform TensorWave and the model provider Fireworks AI. Last year, the chipmaker backed Hugging Face, an open-source A.I. developer platform, in a $235 million round that valued the company at $4.5 billion. AMD isn’t the only chipmaker moonlighting as a major A.I. investor. Nvidia (NVDA), too, has demonstrated a growing appetite for venture capital in recent years; having also partaken in fundraising rounds for Hugging Face, Cohere and Scale AI. The value of its A.I. bets reportedly totaled $1.5 billion at the beginning of 2024—a sharp jump from just $300 million the year prior.

Chip stocks will continue to get a boost from artificial intelligence enthusiasm next year but other trends will emerge to help drive semiconductor shares higher later in the year, Bank of America said. The bank's analysts, led by Vivek Arya, say AI chip stocks will continue to surge before the rally broadens toward less-crowded auto and industrial chipmaker stocks in the second half of 2025. "We see 2025 as a year of two different trends," the analysts said in a note on Monday. In the first half of the year, they see AI semiconductor stocks sustaining strong momentum as excitement continues to build and Nvidia rolls out its new Blackwell GPU. The chip giant's next-gen Blackwell chip has been highly anticipated given its increase in power over the company's current Hopper chip, as companies look for increasingly powerful tools to train and run AI models. The analysts say the strong demand for the chips from US cloud customers like Google and Meta should help the rally sustain momentum, though delivery uncertainties for the chips are a lingering risk after initial shipment delays. "We expect the AI investments driven by AI training and scaling of models to continue, doubling down on the NVDA Blackwell deployment ramps driven by cloud customers," they said. In the second half of the year, though, the analysts see investor interest shifting as AI stocks potentially peak amid concerns about returns on heavy investments by companies in the space. "In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25," the analysts said. "AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon." They say sentiment could shift toward auto and industrial chipmaker stocks as a global economic recovery replenishes inventory and boosts auto production. "In the second half, we expect a pickup in auto/industrial semis as customer/channel inventories normalize (replenishment + easy comps), as well as a pick-up in global auto production," the analysts said. The shift would mark a broadening in the semiconductor rally, which has seen the sector over 30% so far this year as AI chipmakers like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor surge. The analysts see semiconductors maintaining their strong momentum to boost sales by 15% to $725 billion in 2025, marking a slight slowdown from a 20% rise expected for the full year in 2024.
