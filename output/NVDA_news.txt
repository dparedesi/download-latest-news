Title: 5 ‘Fed-Friendly’ REITs Paying Up To 13%

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Fed has finally cut rates, and if the “dot plot” is any indication, it won’t be the last. This is fuel for real estate investment trusts (REITs)—they thrive when borrowing costs fall and their fat dividends shine next to shrinking bond yields. Today we can lock in payouts between 6% and 13% from landlords set to surge as Powell’s long-awaited pivot plays out. Why do REITs rally as rates fall? These stocks act as “bond proxies” that move alongside bonds and opposite rates. Here is a major REIT ETF plotted against the 10-year Treasury yield. As you can see, when the important rate zigs, the REIT benchmark zags: Rate cuts don’t always hit the 10-year overnight. But the direction is now clear—and history shows that REITs rally once the bond market adjusts. So, let’s look at a lineup of landlords yielding up to 13.3% that are ready to ride Powell’s pivot higher. We’ll start with Healthpeak Properties (DOC, 6.5% dividend yield). Healthpeak owns 702 properties across outpatient medical, labs and senior housing. This blend has weighed on 2025 results because labs have been weak. However this “property patient” has perked up since August, when a sad jobs report foreshadowed the September rate cut. In other words, the Fed is driving this rebound: Broadstone Net Lease (BNL, 6.3% dividend yield) specializes in single-tenant commercial properties. Currently, its portfolio is made up of 766 properties in 44 states and four Canadian provinces, leased out to a whopping 205 tenants representing more than 50 industries. Its blend looks a lot different than it did even a year or two ago—Broadstone has been actively shedding healthcare properties, which made up roughly 20% of annualized based rent back in 2024 but now accounts for less than 4% of ABR. Today, industrial makes up roughly 60% of ABR, retail accounts for more than 30%, and office buildings drive most of the remainder. Broadstone deals in “net leases,” where tenants cover taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. BNL just collects rent. Those long-term leases, with built-in 2% rent escalators, deliver the steady cash flows we want from a landlord. I said more than a year ago that although its transformation might weigh on earnings in the short term, “the renewed portfolio focus is a benefit to BNL.” At the time, insiders thought so too. All of us were right. Broadstone’s doing a lot that we can like. It looks like it’s handling the bankruptcies of tenants At Home and Claire’s in stride. Management expects that its burgeoning build-to-suit pipeline will reach its $500 million end-of-year goal. But it’d be nice to see BNL share the wealth. The company recently updated its full-year guidance for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), expecting $1.48 to $1.50 per share. It’s on track to pay $1.16. BNL could easily boost its dividend. Management just hasn’t shared the wealth yet. Global Net Lease (GNL, 9.4% dividend yield) is another commercial net-lease operator, and it has a significant international bent. GNL’s 911-property portfolio spans 10 countries. North American operations (U.S. and Canada) account for 70% of straight-line rents; eight European companies account for the remaining 30%. The average remaining lease term isn’t as long as Broadstone’s, at just over six years, but it does utilize rent escalators, which are on 88% of leases. Global Net Lease has also been busy trying to improve its operations. It recently completed the $1.8 billion sale of its multitenant retail portfolio, which improved overall occupancy and improved its annualized net operating income (NOI) margin. It has been buying back stock. And it has been rapidly deleveraging—GNL has shed $2 billion in net debt in roughly a year. During the company’s most recent earnings call, CEO Michael Weil noted that “S&P Global upgraded our corporate credit rating to BB+ from BB and raised our issuer level rating on our unsecured notes to investment-grade BBB- from BB+.” The stock has been doing exactly what we’d expect in the midst of that kind of turnaround, beating the pants off the real estate sector year-to-date. GNL’s past payout cuts weren’t by choice—they were survival. Dividend coverage looks fine today, but only if cash flow keeps climbing. A couple “hybrid” REITs—Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH, 7.7% dividend yield) and Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN, 13.3% dividend yield) are benefiting from a one-two punch: declining rates and return-to-office mandates. But both cut payouts this year and their balance sheets leave no margin for error: Armada Hoffler kicked off 2025 with weak guidance and a quick dividend cut. It’s still on pace for a significant drop in FFO, and its guidance hasn’t changed, but the most recent quarter saw at least a few green shoots, including a slight improvement in same-store cash NOI growth. Brandywine, while a hybrid REIT, is much heavier in office influence. BDN owns 63 properties representing ~11.8 million rentable square feet, and office space accounts for just less than 90% of each (56 properties representing ~10.4 million rentable square feet). Joint ventures have been Brandywine’s Achilles’ heel of late; some of its development deals force BDN to recognize numerous costs until the projects become profitable, and that has resulted in significant downward revisions to FFO estimates. Relief could be on the way, though, as several JVs could be recapitalized in coming quarters. Brandywine also secured a massive deal with Nvidia (NVDA), which will occupy nearly 100,000 square feet in BDN’s One Uptown development in Austin. But let’s keep a really close eye on the dividend. The payout was 107% of FFO through the first half of 2025, and full-year FFO are expected to just barely pay for the dividend. If Brandywine runs into liquidity issues, that 13%-plus yield could be a rug-pull just waiting to happen. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Is the Big Business of AI Dominated by Too Few Big Businesses?

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.

Title: Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. Economists say that’s a bright red flag | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. But while the market’s climb may be inflating their accounts, they are more exposed than ever to a potential market slump. Direct and indirect stock holdings, including in mutual funds or retirement plans, accounted for an all-time high of 45% of households’ financial assets in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. The record-high stock ownership raises red flags about whether a market downturn could hit Americans’ personal finances — especially in an economy with an increasingly fragile labor market and stubborn inflation. The milestone is a product of multiple factors: stocks have hit record highs, boosting the value of holdings; more Americans are directly participating in the stock market; and retirement plans like 401(k)s that invest in the stock market have risen in popularity in recent decades. Record-high stocks are generally good — that lets more people benefit from Corporate America’s gains, especially long-term investors. But it’s not all upside. Because so many people now own and have so much of their money in stocks, the market has more influence on the economy, for good or ill, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “The impact of a stock market melt-up or a meltdown — it goes both ways — is going to be much more impactful across the economy than, say, just a decade ago,” Roach said. Notably, Americans’ stock ownership has surpassed that of the late 1990s, just before dot-com bubble burst, said John Higgins, chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins said in a note to clients. “Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next,” Higgins added. “But the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.” The S&P 500 has rallied 33% since hitting a low point on April 8. The benchmark index is up 13% since January 1 and has notched 28 record highs this year. The AI boom has fueled the market rally this year. Big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have surged, lifting major indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by companies’ market value. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks — including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500’s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Investors are benefiting, but as the S&P 500 becomes increasingly concentrated — the Mag Seven account for 34% of the S&P’s market value — they remain exposed to the fate of a few enormous companies. AI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out It’s not just American households that are holding record levels of stocks. Foreign investors’ share of US stocks also hit a record high in the second quarter, according to Fed data. History shows that when levels of stock ownership are at record highs, the risk of a downturn and the potential for below-average returns increases, according to Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. “Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat,” Anderson said. “Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns.” While the S&P 500 floats near record highs, concerns are also mounting about the emergence of a “K-shaped economy,” in which the richest Americans get even richer while the poorest Americans continue to struggle or get even poorer. That’s in part because the job market, where most Americans make the bulk of their money, is stagnating, while the stock market, which is how wealthy people tend to make their money, is surging. “Those who have a high degree of wealth in the stock market feel like they’re doing extraordinarily well,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. “Those who don’t, who are largely tied to employment as their primary asset, feel much more constrained in today’s society.” That is creating distortions in economic data, too, helping to paint a rosier overall picture than the one many Americans are feeling in their lives. The buoyant stock market is propping up the net worth of the wealthy, fueling their own spending, which in turn has helped propel economic growth, Roach at LPL Financial said. The data reflect that dichotomy: The top 10% of earners (earning more than $353,000 annually) accounted for more than 49% of consumer spending in the second quarter, the highest share on record going back to 1989, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. But underneath the hood, the economy is on shakier grounds: Lower-income Americans are increasingly strained, and if there is a market slump, it could spook the wealthy Americans who have been propping up the economy with their spending. The Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans “The stock market becomes a bigger economic driver when you’ve got that much exposure,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Gordon said while the market’s gains can spur consumer spending, the opposite can be true when the market tumbles. “There is a bigger risk that to the extent you get a protracted downturn in the market, that starts to weigh on household spending, and starts to weigh on the psychology in particular of people up the wealth spectrum,” Gordon said.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Near the end of 2022, a reader wrote in to tell me that my bullish view of the economy at the time was off the mark. From his vantage point, people were struggling, prices were soaring, and wages weren’t keeping up. This reader wasn’t alone—it was around that time that Bloomberg wrote that the chances of a recession in the next year were 100%. So there was zero chance of avoiding one, in other words. We all know what happened next: The economy and stock market took off. That translated into real gains (and high income) for the portfolio of my CEF Insider service. In our equity bucket, for example, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a long-time holding (more than eight years) posted a total return that topped the S&P 500 from the end of 2022 to the time of this writing. Today, we see a very similar situation, with pessimism running high. The difference now is that stocks are hitting all-time highs, causing a lot of investors (maybe you among them) to ponder selling ahead of a coming downturn. We contrarians, of course, know that when the crowd fears something will happen, something else usually does. Which is why ADX remains a buy, even though (and indeed because) the closed-end fund (CEF) holds high-flying tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN), plus strong blue chips in other sectors, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Here’s why I’m so bullish on stocks—and CEFs—like these. A Strong—Yet Hated—Economy First, we need to say upfront that large companies are seeing surging revenue, with 6.2% year-over-year gains, according to the Financial Times. These gains come from across sectors—with one exception: Energy. That’s understandable, and it’s actually good for US consumers and companies except for, well, Big Oil. Moreover, every sector but consumer discretionary is posting accelerating sales—that is, this year’s gains are bigger than last year’s. That’s the first part of the reason why I’m bullish on funds like ADX. But consider also broader retail spending, excluding cars and gas. It’s a key measure, since people buy cars in long cycles and gas is volatile, so both can skew the numbers. Here we see strong demand for goods and services—another plus for the economy. The outlook is positive, too, with the Federal Reserve’s GDPNow indicator, the most up-to-the-minute metric we have, showing growth above 3%, way above beyond Wall Street economists’ estimates. Why are economists—and indeed most investors—feeling dour, then? Let’s take a closer look at this, starting with what might seem like a pretty weird indicator at first. This chart shows wage growth for workers who are neither managers nor business owners over the past 30 years (the dotted line). It stacks that up against the increase of the cost dining out (the solid line). Like I said, a weird one! But stick with me because it shows these workers’ average earnings have risen more than the cost dining out. The takeaway: Average Americans have more money to eat out, and that’s actually a reasonably good barometer of middle-class wealth gains. But there are drawbacks to this chart, mainly that it doesn’t show things like costs for education, healthcare and other basics. All of these are becoming heavier burdens for the lower middle class. And since these people are a big part of the economy, this makes things look tougher for many Americans. Indeed, they are tougher. We can make of that what each of us will, of course, but we always endeavor to stay out of politics here at Contrarian Outlook—and focus solely on what the data is telling us. And that is this: The US economy is growing strongly, even though the lower middle class is struggling. It follows, then, that the rich are driving more corporate sales. This is bad for social welfare, sure, but from an economic perspective, it just means the kinds of things being sold are changing and the number of people buying them is shrinking. Bloomberg has some good data on this, showing that the top 10% of income earners now account for nearly 50% of total consumer spending—a record high. Now, we might worry that if the number of people driving revenue growth keeps shrinking, a pullback would result. And I agree. But wealthy Americans’ share of consumer spending also skyrocketed in the late 1990s, and I know I don’t have to tell you what stocks have done since then. So, no matter where each of us stand on the rich being a bigger part of the economy, this isn’t necessarily bad for business. In fact, in many cases, it can be good for business. But it absolutely can result in higher pessimism overall. And pessimism, as we contrarians know, provides buying opportunities. Which brings me back to ADX, which, despite the S&P 500 levitating higher, has seen its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) widen in the last three months. Today, we have a chance to buy this smartly run CEF for 9% off. That’s partly a hangover from a change ADX made to its distribution in 2024. Under its old scheme, the fund paid minuscule regular dividends and made up for those with a huge end-of-year special payout that varied depending on its NAV performance. Now, ADX targets an 8% annualized payout (based on NAV), paid four times a year. So if NAV rises, so does the payout. That’s much more investor-friendly, and it’s caused ADX’s discount to narrow slightly in the last year or so, but not as much as it should. That’s our chance to buy, as ADX is positioned to benefit from themes like the spread of AI and the resulting build-out of data centers. And we can get in at that 9% discount—thanks again to investor pessimism and misunderstanding. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Reports that a group of investors could be gearing up for a takeover bid helped drive a power-up for a major video game publisher, while soft same-store sales results in the U.S. weighed on the stock of a membership warehouse club. Major U.S. equities indexes broke their three-day losing streak as a key inflation gauge was in line with expectations, which could keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates further. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, the Dow was up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.4% higher. Click here to find more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market news. Shares of video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) surged nearly 15%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after a report that a deal could be in the works to take the company private. According to The Wall Street Journal, a group of investors that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the private equity firm Silver Lake could be nearing a $50 billion transaction—potentially the largest leveraged buyout of all time—to take over the game publisher known for its sports titles. President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs Thursday, including levies on imports of pharmaceuticals, certain types of furniture, and heavy-duty trucks. Shares of Paccar (PCAR), parent company of the Peterbilt and Kenworth truck brands, gaining over 5%. The company had previously indicated that tariff-related uncertainty was weighing on the truck market, with U.S. truck manufacturers also managing the impact of tariffs on key components like steel and aluminum. Intel (INTC) shares extended their recent rally, adding 4.4% Friday. The Wall Street Journal indicated that, in addition to talks with Apple (AAPL), Intel has approached TSMC (TSM) about potential investment and partnership opportunities. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest company by market capitalization, announced a $5 billion investment and collaboration plan with Intel last week. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.6% after the Federal Aviation Administration said the plane maker will be allowed to issue airworthiness certificates on some of its 737 Max and 787 jets. The eased restrictions, which enable the company to conduct the final safety check on certain aircraft, could help Boeing accelerate production and delivery schedules. In addition, Turkish Airlines finalized a deal to purchase 225 Boeing planes following Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to the U.S. this week. Costco (COST) stock slid nearly 3% after the members-only warehouse giant reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. Sales and profits topped analysts' expectations, but U.S. same-store sales fell slightly short of estimates. While shoppers may be drawn to Costco's bargains on essential items amid economic uncertainty and concerns about inflation, the company said consumers remain cautious about discretionary purchases and pointed to intensifying competition in the space. Oracle (ORCL) shares fell 2.7% Friday, extending declines posted in the prior session after Rothschild Redburn initiated coverage of the stock with a "sell" rating. Analysts cautioned that markets may be overly optimistic in their lofty expectations for the software provider's cloud operations. Shares of online auction platform operator eBay (EBAY) slipped about 2%. The stock had notched strong gains after the e-commerce company posted better-than-expected revenue, adjusted earnings, and gross merchandise volume in its latest earnings report released at the end of July. EBay said this week that it agreed to purchase Norway-based consumer-to-consumer social marketplace Tise.

Title: Key Indicators to Watch in Q4: Bitcoin Seasonal Trends, XRP/BTC, Dollar Index, Nvidia, and More
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/26/key-indicators-to-watch-in-q4-bitcoin-seasonal-trends-xrp-btc-dollar-index-nvidia-and-more
Time Published: 2025-09-26T07:25:27Z
Full Content:
This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. As we approach the final quarter of 2025, the following key charts provide valuable insights to help crypto traders navigate the evolving market landscape. Seasonal trends suggest a bullish Q4 outlook for both BTC$113,946.33 and ETH$4,195.84, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Since 2013, BTC$113,946.33 has delivered an average return of 85% in the final quarter, according to data from Coinglass, making Q4 historically the strongest period for bulls. November stands out as the most bullish month, with an average gain of 46%, followed by October, which typically sees a 21% increase. ETH$4,195.84 also tends to perform well in the last three months of the year, although its strongest historical returns have been in the first quarter since inception. Bitcoin's price has dropped by 5% this week, consistent with the bearish technical signals and looks set to extend losses to late August lows near $107,300. If bulls fail to defend that, the focus will shift to the 200-day simple moving average at $104,200. The ongoing price decline, combined with bitcoin's historical pattern of peaking approximately 16 to 18 months after a halving event, may scare bulls. However, such concerns may be premature as long as prices remain above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This moving average has consistently acted as a support level, marking the end of corrective price pullbacks during the current bull run that began in early 2023. Traders, therefore, should closely watch the 50-week SMA, which is currently positioned around $98,900, as a key level for broader market direction. XRP, often called the "U.S. government coin" by firms like Arca, has surged 32% this year. However, despite this strong rally, the payments-focused cryptocurrency remains confined within a prolonged sideways trading range against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), showing limited relative strength. The XRP/BTC pair has been confined within a narrow trading range since early 2021, resulting in over four years of low-volatility compression. Recent price action near the upper boundary of this channel suggests that bulls are gradually gaining control. A breakout from such a prolonged consolidation could trigger a powerful rally in XRP relative to BTC, as the accumulated energy from this squeeze is released. Now, let’s turn to charts that call for caution. The leveraged anti-Strategy ETF (SMST), which seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in bitcoin-holder Strategy's (MSTR) share price, is flashing bullish signals. The ETF’s price climbed to a five-month high of $35.65, forming what appears to be an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by a prominent trough (the head) flanked by two smaller, roughly equal troughs (the shoulders). This pattern often signals a potential bullish reversal, suggesting the ETF may be gearing up for a significant upward move. In other words, it's flashing a bearish signal for both BTC and Strategy, which is the largest publicly listed BTC holder with a coin stash of 639,835 BTC. Last week, I discussed the dollar's post-Fed rate cut resilience as a potential headwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The dollar index has since gained ground, establishing a double bottom at around 96.30. It's a sign that bulls have successfully established the path of least resistance on the higher side. A continued move beyond 100.26, the high of the interim recovery between the twin bottoms around 96.30, would confirm the so-called double bottom breakout, opening the door for a move to 104.00. Watch out for the pattern failure below 96.00, as that could lead to increased risk-taking in financial markets. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest listed company by market value, and a bellwether for risk assets, continues to flirt with the upper end of the broadening channel identified by June 2024 and November 2024 highs and lows hit in August 2024 and April 2025. The rally has stalled at the upper trendline since late July in a sign of bullish exhaustion. Should it decline from here, it could signal the onset of a risk-off period in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Stock futures are lower after two straight days of declines for major indexes as investors await key economic data; Costco Wholesale (COST) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell; Intel (INTC) shares are rising on a report it is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL); and Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off workers and closing stores as it continues to restructure. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing a lower open for major indexes after two days of declines as investors prepare for the release of key economic data reports to finish off the week. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%. Gold futures edged higher to $3,785 an ounce to stay near record highs, while bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $111,500, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer borrowing costs, edged higher to 4.16%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today, with some analysts expecting volatility in the stock. The update comes after some investors were shaken in the spring by signs that sales growth had decelerated. The company has already reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect the retailer to report that profits grew to $2.6 million in the fourth-quarter, up from $2.4 million a year ago. Costco shares, which have gained 3% since the start of the year, were slightly higher in premarket trading. Data on economic growth, jobless claims and housing sales are in focus this morning ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report that's set to be released Friday. The jobless claims numbers, which are expected to show a slight increase, are being closely watched by investors after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week amid signs that the labor market is weakening. Revisions to second-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that growth held steady at 3.3%, while existing home sales are estimated to have declined slightly. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, ahead of the release tomorrow morning of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Shares of Intel (INTC) continued gaining ground this morning following a report the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). Intel shares rose more than 6% on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported on talks between the companies, which also centered on other ways that Apple could help the beleaguered chipmaker. The report comes after Nvidia (NVDA) last week agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal that will see the two companies co-develop chips for data centers and PCs. Intel shares were up nearly 2% in recent premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% year-to-date, but remain well off its historical highs. Apple shares were little changed ahead of the bell. Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off around 900 employees in its corporate offices and closing some stores as CEO Brian Niccol continues to implement his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. Niccol said in an update Thursday that the total number of stores was expected to decline by about 1% in 2025 after the closures. He said that laid-off employees in corporate offices would receive severance packages, while employees at closed stores could also receive severance if they are not transferred to other nearby stores. The moves come as analysts have praised the coffee chain’s efforts to revive sales amid sluggish customer traffic. Starbucks shares were flat in premarket trading.
