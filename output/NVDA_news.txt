Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday announced plans to build supercomputers entirely in the U.S., with the chipmaker and its partners set to invest up to $500 billion in American AI infrastructure over the next four years. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding "American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia said its supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, being built in partnership with Foxconn and Wistron, are set to ramp production in the next 12 to 15 months. The chipmaker said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) facilities in Arizona. Nvidia shares were about 1% lower in recent trading, and have fallen about 18% since the start of the year, as concerns about tariffs and other factors have weighed on tech giants.

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) will begin manufacturing AI supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time, the company announced Monday. The chip manufacturer wrote in a blog post that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas. At the Texas factories, located in Houston and Dallas, Nvidia will build and test AI supercomputers. The chipmaker expects mass production to ramp up there over the next 12 to 15 months. The Arizona plant, located in Phoenix, will be reserved for manufacturing Blackwell chips. Production there has already begun. Nvidia said it plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through its various manufacturing partnerships. “Nvidia AI supercomputers are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence — AI factories that are the infrastructure powering a new AI industry,” the company wrote. It added that it expects its manufacturing of AI chips and supercomputers to “create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security” over the next few decades. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the announcement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia previously has touted its AI supercomputers as being capable of allowing anyone to prototype and develop AI models from their personal computers. The company announced the DGX personal AI supercomputers earlier this year. Nvidia stock fell about half a percent following the announcement about its U.S. manufacturing Monday morning. It’s down about 20% on the year in the face of the market uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Title: Apple, Dell, and Goldman Sachs: Stocks to watch today

A Nasdaq bounce looks to be brewing on Monday after U.S. officials moved to temporarily exempt smartphones, laptops, and other high-end electronics from the Trump administration’s sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. The European tech sector signaled strength earlier in the morning, and stateside, Apple (AAPL+2.21%) shares jumped more than 6%, Dell (DELL+4.44%) surged over 7%, and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) and Intel (INTC+2.89%) each climbed over 3% in early trading. The rally reflects just how sensitive markets remain to even short-lived tariff clarity. But that clarity may be fleeting. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend that while consumer electronics are spared from reciprocal tariffs, they’re still on track to face new levies — set to hit “in probably a month or two.” Meanwhile, Apple grabbed headlines for a different reason: taking the global top spot in smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025. Strong demand for the iPhone 16e in Japan and India helped push Apple ahead of Samsung and its Chinese rivals. Even as supply chain concerns persist, Apple’s global brand power remains formidable. Following strong results from mega-banks last week, Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) reported a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, before Monday’s market open. Strong trading revenues drove the beat, and shares rose 2% in early trading. But Goldman’s performance is also a reminder: Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in chaos. As a barometer for capital flows and market confidence, Goldman’s beat underscores how volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. Despite Monday’s bounce, market outlooks are getting darker. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) and Citigroup (C+3.39%) both slashed their year-end targets for U.S. equities, citing decelerating earnings growth, global instability, and increasingly erratic policy moves. With major names like Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ+1.73%), and UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) reporting this week, investor mood may hinge on whether the fundamentals hold — or whether Monday’s premarket optimism proves to be another false dawn.

Title: Stocks rise as Apple jumps and Goldman beats on earnings. But fears linger beneath the bounce

U.S. stocks edged up Monday as investors digested mixed messages on the trade war, following some of the most chaotic and turbulent weeks in recent market memory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 added 42 points, also climbing 0.8% by market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 107 points, or 0.6%. Gold, meanwhile, slipped 0.8%, suggesting a slight pullback from last week’s mad dash into safe-haven assets. Apple (AAPL+2.21%) stock climbed, helping lead market indexes higher. A surprise tariff announcement late Friday triggered the tech-led bounce on Monday. The electronics exemption, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, seemed to shield smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics from Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods — offering relief for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple, Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%) But the reprieve may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the products are still included under a round of semiconductor-related tariffs “coming in probably a month or two.” And President Donald Trump later rejected the idea that there had been any exemption at all, saying that the goods are still subject to existing 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs and that they had merely shifted tariff categories. He said no product was actually exempt, calling the change a simple reclassification. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said Sunday on his social media site Truth Social. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized the shifting policies as “chaos and corruption,” warning that such unpredictability is eroding investor confidence. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index is still planted in “extreme fear” territory, reflecting a lack of bullish sentiment amid chaotic policy announcements — to say nothing of chaotic policy determination. The S&P 500’s recent 5% intraday swings suggest volatility that is more structural than seasonal. Analysts at both Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) and Citigroup (C+3.39%) have cut their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks, pointing to rising risks from such unpredictable policy moves and continuing geopolitical tensions. Heading into a packed week of corporate earnings in which major banks, healthcare companies, and consumer-facing platforms such as Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) will report results, each release could either steady or rattle investor nerves. Apple stock jumped 2.2% Monday, lifted by hopes the company will be temporarily exempt from new electronics tariffs. President Trump said Monday afternoon that he was “flexible” when it came to a temporary exemption for Apple. Separately, Apple reclaimed the top spot in global smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025, thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 16e in markets such as Japan and India. Even alongside valid fears of disruptions to Apple’s supply chain, the company’s product suite and global brand power remain unmatched. Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) reported a robust 15% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, driven by strong trading performance amid market volatility. Goldman stock rose 1.9% Monday. But it’s not just about one earnings beat. Goldman is a bellwether for how corporate America is handling volatility, providing a real-time pulse check on capital flows and investor sentiment in a year that’s been anything but normal. On Monday, it’s a reminder that Wall Street firms may make money whether times are good or bad. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a critical support level that has held historical significance. This price range saw nearly ten years of consolidation from 2004 to 2014 before the stock began trending higher, indicating strong buying interest around current levels. This support seems solid, as shown by the stock’s ability to hold up following a sharp 30%+ decline in August 2024. While the length of this consolidation is unknown, Intel at $20 presents a compelling value case, though investors should remain mindful of associated risks. For those seeking gains with lower volatility than individual stocks, check out the High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. INTC Stock Price History Intel’s current valuation reflects its recent performance struggles. The company is facing negative revenue growth, while competitors AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are enjoying double-digit increases. With negative earnings, Intel trades at a Price to Sales ratio of just 1.8, versus 6.5 for AMD, 4.2 for QCOM, and 20.3 for Nvidia. This may make Intel more appealing as a long-term value play than a short-term growth bet. There are several potential catalysts that could unlock value for Intel: The biggest risk for investors buying at these levels is the potential for capital to be locked up if the stock remains in consolidation for an extended period. It may take time for catalysts to have an effect, requiring patience for meaningful returns. Not keen on the volatility of INTC? The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks tend to deliver higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark, offering a smoother ride. Explore HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: US stock futures rise amid temporary tariff exemptions for tech products | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Stock futures rose Sunday after a temporary reprieve from tariffs on electronic imports from China by the Trump administration. Dow futures were up 0.5%, or 212 points. The S&P 500 futures rose 0.75%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures gained 1.26%, as of 6:18 pm ET. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronic imports from reciprocal tariffs; any of those goods manufactured in China — like computers, phones and semiconductors — would still be subject to the 20% tariff Trump previously imposed on Chinese goods. The gains come after stocks have seesawed wildly in recent days, as President Donald Trump has levied massive tariffs on US trading partners, then backed off many of those import taxes. Still, confusion about how permanent or temporary some tariff moves could be has stoked uncertainty among investors and kept stocks, the dollar and even US Treasuries under pressure. Tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) rely on Chinese manufacturing, and the reciprocal tariffs would have made goods like iPhones and other consumer products more expensive. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the exemption was “not permanent.” Other administration officials said another slate of tariffs could be imposed after an investigation into the national security effects of semiconductor imports. Trump posted to his Truth Social platform that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” The back-and-forth on tariffs has caused many investors and others to hold off on major decisions until they get clarity. “Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing ‘red light, green light’ with tariffs and saying, ‘Oh, and for my special donors, you get a special exemption,’” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump has imposed various tariffs in recent weeks, after repeatedly postponing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and automotive imports. A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on all countries, and higher rates were imposed on roughly 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders,” including tariffs on Cambodia (49%), Vietnam (46%) and the European Union (20%). Stocks plunged on April 3 after the news, with two consecutive sessions of sell-offs that wiped nearly $6 trillion in market value and continued with another volatile day on Monday, April 7, as the tariff chaos continued.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

Time Published: 2025-04-13T12:18:17Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft can 'breathe a huge sigh of relief' after Trump's China tariff exemptions

The ever-growing U.S. tariffs on imports from China won’t bite Big Tech so badly after all, after the Trump administration late Friday laid out significant exemptions from its wider trade war that include smartphones, laptop computers, chips, and more. The exemptions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, amount to a huge break for tech giants such as Apple (AAPL+2.21%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%), and Microsoft (MSFT+0.24%), and for the broader tech industry, even as uncertainty persists over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war. It means some of the most crucial and high-end technology imports — which overwhelmingly aren’t made in the U.S. — won’t be subject to Trump’s 125% tariff on China, or his baseline 10% tariff on almost every other country. A Wall Street analyst quickly called it “the best news possible for tech investors.” “The U.S. tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House, the reality of the situation was finally recognized in the Beltway,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Saturday. “There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations. Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday.” The exemptions follow a pattern from Trump’s first term, when Apple in particular saw significant success in lobbying Trump for trade war carveouts. Making products such as the iPhone in America would be almost economically impossible. Wedbush had warned earlier this month that Apple faced a “complete disaster” from the China tariffs. And the Trump administration’s move came as its trade war has driven days of volatility in financial markets, as well as cratering consumer confidence and growing recession fears. Ives called the exemptions “a big step forward for U.S. tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend. ... Big Tech is back off the cliff with these exemptions and this changes the entire situation for tech stocks with this black swan event for the industry removed.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: UBS: Taiwan’s Surging Exports Imply A Data Center Revenue Of $42 Billion For NVIDIA’s April-Ending Quarter

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With President Trump's global trade war rapidly morphing into a tit-for-tat tariff-related one-upmanship between the US and China, NVIDIA is now finding itself at the very center of this maelstrom, replete with opportunities and challenges that such a strategic position almost always entails. We got a glimpse of NVIDIA's elevated negotiating power recently when it was able to win an unfettered exemption from the Trump administration to continue selling AI-critical H20 GPUs in China. Now, UBS is out with a fresh note that leverages Taiwan's surging exports - presumably boosted by tariff-related pull-ins - to quantify the upside for NVIDIA's data center sales in the April-ending quarter. To wit, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri notes that Taiwan's exports of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) equipment ex laptops clocked-in at $12.03 billion for March 2025, corresponding to a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 20.6 percent relative to February's export figure of $9.97 billion. Arcuri points out that March is historically the strongest export month for Taiwan, typically recording MoM growth of mid-20 percent over February's figures. This means that Taiwan's export figures for March were a tad weaker than what historical analogs would imply. The UBS analyst, however, takes pains to note that Taiwan just witnessed its "strongest February in over a decade (+14% M/M relative to -15% historical seasonality)." The analyst then asserts: "Assuming April constitutes a "normal" 36% of total F1Q (Apr Q) would imply ~$34B of exports - a large step-up of ~58% Q/Q - although it is unclear to what extent this reflects tariff pull-ins rather than underlying strength." Basically, if Taiwan's April exports follow their historical pattern, the country would likely record a quarter-over-quarter export growth of 58 percent. According to Arcuri, this level of exports would imply an 18 percent quarter-over-quarter growth in NVIDIA's data center revenues: "We model NVDA's data center revenue up 18% Q/Q to $42B in Apr Q." While the UBS analyst cautions that Taiwan's export data has not been predictive of NVIDIA's data center sales for the past few quarters, his overall thesis is bolstered by TSMC recently reporting "above-seasonality" sales for March 2025. Of course, this comes as Citi has just lowered its total GPU sales forecast for NVIDIA by 3 percent for the ongoing CY 2025, and 5 percent for the CY 2026, citing "mostly lower Microsoft capex concerns and higher risk of pause in enterprise investments amid uncertainty around the global economy due to ongoing trade war." Meanwhile, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." Accordingly, Lynx Equity now expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

Title: Bitcoin’s Recent Drawdown Proves Its More Than Just a Leveraged Tech Play

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has fallen below 100 and gold has surged to new all-time highs as escalating tariffs have heightened global economic uncertainty. Consequently, asset prices have taken a hit—most notably in the tech sector and cryptocurrencies. Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, bitcoin’s drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown. To highlight bitcoin’s resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly. This comparison underscores how bitcoin has grown more resilient over time as its market cycles progress and the asset continues to mature.
