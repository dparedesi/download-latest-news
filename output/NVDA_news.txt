Title: Here's What President Trump Said About Intel's CEO That's Boosting the Stock Friday

Intel's stock hit its highest point in nearly two years Friday, thanks to a social media post. The chipmaker's stock was up nearly 10% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Friday after President Trump praised Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on social media. "I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, and that the U.S. government is "proud" to be an Intel shareholder. Just a few months earlier, Trump had pushed for Lip-Bu Tan to resign amid concerns about Tan's stakes in Chinese companies. However, Trump changed his tune just days later after meeting with the CEO in August, and brokered a deal that saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel's stock has gotten a big boost from Trump's show of support, though it remains well off its historical highs as the embattled chipmaker works to convince investors of a sustainable turnaround in its business. A high-profile partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) followed not long after the government announced its stake, helped lift Intel's stock in the second half of last year, along with rumors about potential new customers. The shares nearly doubled in value last year, with most of those gains coming between early August and December. Intel's recent gains have also made the stock one of the top performers in the S&P 500 to start the year, with shares adding close to one-quarter of their value in January so far. A number of other semiconductor stocks followed Intel higher Friday, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contributing to a broader market rally that pushed the S&P 500 to a new high.

Title: Nvidia (NVDA) Stock: Poaching Google's Marketing Leader Signals New Strategy - CoinCentral

Nvidia made a key leadership move Thursday by hiring its first chief marketing officer. The company tapped Google Cloud marketing veteran Alison Wagonfeld for the newly created position. NVIDIA Corporation, NVDA Wagonfeld announced her departure from Google on LinkedIn. She will join Nvidia in late January after spending nearly a decade at the search giant. At Google, Wagonfeld led marketing for the cloud computing business. She worked closely with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. Her new role at Nvidia consolidates marketing responsibilities that were previously split among several people. She will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang. The hire comes as Nvidia looks to expand beyond just chip sales. The company wants to position itself as a full AI platform provider offering software, systems, and services. Wagonfeld’s move from Google to Nvidia highlights the relationship between the two tech companies. “I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She emphasized that Google and Nvidia maintain a strong partnership. The two companies plan to continue their collaboration despite her switch. This partnership angle matters for investors. Some analysts have worried about competition from Google’s Tensor Processing Units potentially eating into Nvidia’s dominance. Signs of cooperation rather than rivalry could ease these concerns. The market may view Wagonfeld’s hire as confirmation that the two companies see themselves as partners rather than enemies. Nvidia stock fell 2.2% during Thursday’s trading session. Shares remained flat in after-hours trading following the announcement. The stock has struggled to break out recently. It’s down 1% over the past three months despite strong demand indicators for AI chips. Nvidia remains the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips. But the stock has been range-bound for several months as investors digest its rapid gains from earlier periods. The company faces questions about maintaining its market leadership as competitors ramp up their own chip offerings. Google’s TPUs represent one potential challenge to Nvidia’s position. Wagonfeld brings deep experience in marketing complex technology products to enterprise customers. Her background at Google Cloud could help Nvidia refine its messaging as it expands beyond hardware. The appointment reflects Nvidia’s evolution from a chip company to a broader AI infrastructure provider. Creating a CMO role signals the company’s intent to strengthen its brand and market positioning during this transition.

Title: Can Palantir Double Again in 2026? This Analyst Is Confident

Time Published: 2026-01-08T18:08:13Z
Full Content:
Investing Palantir (PLTR) trades at 180 times forward earnings despite expected sales growth slowing from 54% to 42%. Palantir reports full-year 2025 results on February 2nd. The stock has stalled near $180 after reaching $200 in October. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Palantir could reach a $1 trillion valuation within two to three years. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / Piotr Swat Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) stock has made remarkably little progress in the past few months. It is below the level it was in August 2025, so concerns about a plateau seem quite valid. The momentum that carried it from $20 in April 2024 to over $200 in October 2025 seems lost. That said, no one knows what kind of paradigm shift 2026 may bring for the company as defense tech spending remains hot. The business itself is humming on strong, with the full-year 2025 plus Q4 report expected to be out on the 2nd of February. This may reinvigorate the bulls and push the stock beyond $200 again if Palantir reports another blockbuster quarter. But some analysts believe $200 is just a stepping stone to an even more ambitious valuation: $1 trillion. Let’s first look at where Palantir stands today before we explore the analyst’s argument. Among big companies, Palantir is the one you have to pay the most for, by far. Analysts who have been ringing the bell on an AI bubble expect Palantir to be the first domino to fall, even ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). That’s because, unlike Nvidia, the stock price is far ahead of the earnings curve. Buying PLTR stock at ~$180 today means you’re paying for results over a decade in advance. PLTR stock trades at almost 180 times forward earnings. Even on a free cash flow basis, you’re paying in excess of 130 times FCF. In comparison, NVDA stock trades at 25 times forward earnings with stronger and more durable sales growth. A software company like Palantir is not in the intersection of the AI infrastructure buildout and mostly relies on an increasing number of customers. The company can scale once it gets its foot in the door, but there’s only so much market it can capture. Analysts thus expect sales growth to come down a notch from ~54% for all of 2025 to ~42% in 2026. EPS growth is also expected to come down from 77% to less than 40% this year. In short, you may not be getting your money’s worth. The idea is that AI will be rapidly adopted across U.S. commercial companies, with Palantir being the “default” enterprise AI platform. This may allow it to grow much faster than expected, with Wall Street slapping an even higher premium. And the idea does have some meat to it. If the market was comfortable paying over 200 times forward earnings, 400, or even 500, may not look too ridiculous until the music stops. The most well-known analyst pushing this is Dan Ives from Wedbush, who believes Palantir can be a $1 trillion company within “two to three years”. He has advised investors to “triple down” on the stock. A lesser-known analyst, Will McGough from Prime Capital, also believes PLTR can reach a $1 trillion market cap. The likelihood of PLTR stock doubling in 2026 is minuscule. If the AI rally accelerates this year, PLTR Palantir can cross $200 again, and perhaps $250, but even with blockbuster earnings and an unceasing rally, doubling the market cap from here is unrealistic. The stock has been losing momentum, so a $1 trillion valuation in even two years is extremely unlikely at this point. Software AI stocks are seeing maturing valuations, and the market is likely to let the earnings catch up to the sky-high valuations first before slapping a bigger premium. The worst-case scenario would be if the AI rally ends this year. There’s plenty of profit to be taken, and the market will hurriedly punish the stock, especially if Palantir cannot sustain the beat-and-raise cadence for dozens of quarters as expected. All things considered, it is much safer to buy AI hardware stocks. For software AI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains my top bet. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Trump Takes on Buybacks, Dividends and Executive Pay at U.S. Defense Contractors
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/trump-takes-on-buybacks-dividends-and-executive-pay-at-u-s-defense-contractors-11881104
Time Published: 2026-01-07T22:14:16Z
Full Content:
The age-old practices of buying back shares and issuing dividends have a new—and perhaps unlikely—foe. President Donald Trump on Wednesday took aim at defense companies with stock buyback- and dividend-programs, saying they "will no longer be allowed or tolerated." In doing so, he revived a topic that has in recent years been a source of debate between those who see share repurchases as a straightforward method of supporting a company's stock and critics who believe that that cash could be put to better use. For Trump, meanwhile, it's the latest addition to the list of public-company matters—he also on Wednesday tackled executive compensation—over which the White House would like greater control. (He separately today also suggested a ban on large investor purchases of homes.) The Trump administration's direct involvement in the affairs of chipmakers and minerals companies have moved their respective stocks. Shares in defense shops were in the spotlight on Wednesday. Trump's hands-on approach has led to the government taking a cut of Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) "chip sales," a so-called golden share of U.S. Steel's sale to Nippon Steel, a 10% stake in Intel (INTC) that followed demands that the chipmaker's CEO be fired, and several equity stakes in rare earth minerals companies. All were justified as investments necessary for economic security and to mitigate national security risk. "Military equipment is not being made fast enough!" Trump said in posts on Truth Social and X. "It must be built now with the Dividends, Stock Buybacks, and Over Compensation of Executives, rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions, or getting the money from your government." Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and General Dynamics (GD) were down at least 4% by Wednesday's close. The question of how publicly traded companies use their cash is of interest to partisans of all stripe, though a distaste for corporate buyback programs might align Trump with his predecessor, President Biden, and Democratic leaders including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, and Elizabeth Warren. President Biden in 2022 signed into law a 1% excise tax of stock repurchases—though that has hardly put a dent in the practice. Companies in the S&P 500 spent more than $1 trillion in the 12 months ended September 2025, up from more than $918 billion in the prior year period, according to S&P Global. If Trump—who has also said companies shouldn't have to report earnings so frequently—is able to formalize his threat to bar companies in the defense sector from stock repurchases and dividends, it would ratchet up his brand of "state capitalism" up a notch—from deals to outright directives.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after the major indexes posted big gains to start the week; Nvidia and AMD each showcased new AI-focused products in their respective events at CES on Monday; oil stocks are rising further after leading Monday's rally on hopes that they will benefit from new leadership in Venezuela; Gold and silver are once again approaching record highs amid the geopolitical uncertainty; and high demand for hardware to run AI models continues to boost Micron and other chipmakers. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are mixed Tuesday after the major indexes each gained on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average setting new intraday and closing records. Dow futures were down 0.1% recently, while futures linked to the S&P 500 were hovering near unchanged and Nasdaq futures added 0.2%. WTI crude oil futures were up 0.5% at $58.60 per barrel, trading at their highest levels in a month, as market participants try to gauge the impact of developments in oil-rich Venezuela. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,475 an ounce, while bitcoin was at $93,800, down slightly from yesterday afternoon but still near its highest levels in more than a month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, rose to 4.18% from 4.16% at Monday's close. Investors have a slew of AI updates to digest, after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su each spoke at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. Huang showcased Nvidia's new Rubin chips that will go on sale later this year, focusing on applications in the real world like robotics and self-driving cars. AMD also revealed its newest chips, for use in products like personal computers and servers, as well as physical AI applications like robotics. Shares of Nvidia and AMD, which fell on Monday ahead of the presentations, were up less than 1% in premarket trading. Oil stocks are extending gains this morning after leading the market's rally Monday. Oil and gas companies got a boost from news over the weekend that the U.S. had captured Nicolás Maduro, the president of oil-rich Venezuela. President Donald Trump has said that the U.S. will encourage its oil companies to invest in Venezuela to "fix" its crumbling oil infrastructure and increase oil production. Shares of Chevron (CVX), the only U.S. company that currently has a presence in Venezuela, were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading after leading the Dow with a 5% jump Monday. Oil majors ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), as well as oilfield services companies Baker Hughes (BKR) and SLB (SLB), were also higher this morning after posting solid gains yesterday. The uncertainty created by the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela has also sparked a rally for precious metals as some investors turn to safe-haven assets. Gold futures were up 0.5% recently at $4,475 an ounce, moving toward the record high of around $4,580 set on Dec, 26. Silver futures were up nearly 2% this morning at $78.15 an ounce, approaching the all-time high of about $83 set late last month. Investors frequently turn to gold and other precious metals as stores of value during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals set a number of record highs last year—the price of gold rose 65% in 2025—amid stock market volatility, concerns over tariffs, a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Shares of Micron Technology (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Intel (INTC) are each gaining Tuesday morning as the hardware portion of the AI trade continues to be strong. Micron shares soared some 240% in 2025 as its revenue surged due to high demand for the memory components it sells to other chipmakers such as Nvidia. The demand for hardware to run AI models has also created a shortage in the memory market, driving prices to record highs and further boosting Micron's revenue in recent quarters. Counterpoint Research has forecast that memory prices could rise another 40% through the second quarter of this year, a potential further boon for companies like Micron that could also lead to higher prices for smartphones and computer hardware.

Nvidia (NVDA) held its CES 2026 keynote today, and as expected, Jensen Huang dropped a massive amount of news on the autonomous driving front. The biggest takeaway? Nvidia is moving beyond just “perceiving” the road to “reasoning” about it with a new family of open-source models called Alpamayo, which will power new autonomous and driver-assistance features. Starting with Mercedes-Benz as soon as this quarter. Here’s the breakdown of everything Nvidia announced for self-driving technology today. Nvidia is calling this the “ChatGPT moment for physical AI.” The company unveiled Alpamayo, a family of open-source AI models designed to solve the “long tail” problem of autonomous driving, those rare, weird edge cases that usually cause self-driving stacks to disengage or fail. The flagship is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model. Unlike traditional AV stacks that just detect objects and plan a path, Alpamayo uses “chain-of-thought” reasoning. It processes video input and generates a trajectory, but crucially, it also outputs the logic behind its decision. Jensen Huang explained that the model can “think through rare scenarios” and explain its driving decisions. To sweeten the deal for developers, Nvidia is going the open-source route. They are releasing: This is a clear play to become the default “Android of Autonomy” while Tesla continues to keep its Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack completely closed. We’ve been hearing about the Nvidia-Mercedes partnership for years, but today we got a concrete timeline. Huang confirmed that the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first production vehicle to ship with Nvidia’s entire AV stack, including the new Alpamayo reasoning capabilities. While it’s officially launching as a “Level 2+” system, much like Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’, which in reality is a level 2 driver assistance system as it requires attention from the driver at all times, it appears that the goal is to push toward level 4 capabilities. Here’s how Mercedes describes the system right now: With Mercedes-Benz’s MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, driving assistance and navigation merge to create a completely new and safe driving experience. At the press of a button, the vehicle can help navigate through the city streets – from the parking lot to the destination – with advanced SAE-Level 2 assistance. Thanks to Mercedes-Benz’s cooperative steering approach, steering adaptions are possible at any time without deactivating the system. The sensor stack consists of 30 sensors, including 10 cameras, 5 radar sensors and 12 ultrasonic sensors. Powering all this backend training and simulation is Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin platform, the successor to Blackwell. It’s a six-chip AI platform that Nvidia claims is now in full production. While much of this is data-center focused, the “Rubin” GPUs and “Vera” CPUs are what will likely be training the next iterations of Alpamayo that end up in your car. This is a very interesting move from Nvidia. "while Tesla continues to keep its Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack completely closed" who remembers Tesla "all our patents are belong to you" pledge? The fact that Alpamayo outputs a “reasoning trace” is huge for regulators who are terrified of black-box AI models crashing cars without us knowing why. The open-source aspect is also brilliant. By giving away the model and the simulator, Nvidia ensures that startups and other automakers get hooked on their CUDA ecosystem. If you can’t build an autonomous system by yourself (which, let’s be honest, most legacy automakers can’t), you now just grab Alpamayo and run it on Nvidia chips. As for the Mercedes CLA, “Level 2+” that feels like plans to deliver something like Tesla has with FSD without the promise of unsupervised self-driving, something Tesla has consistently failed to deliver despite selling it to its customers since 2016. If Mercedes actually ships a car in Q1 that can have similar capabilities as Tesla’s FSD, and it is based on an open-sourced system that any automaker can buy, it could shake up the industry and start to commoditize this idea of “level 2+” autonomous systems.
