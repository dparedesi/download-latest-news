Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street. The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%. The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get a December rate cut, after all. Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets. Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December? At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting: Phew. Right? Wrong. Traders at first cheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday. Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions. “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween. Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat. Bitcoin dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022. Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer. Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all. Investors also looked more closely at a particularly confusing jobs report and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull. Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all. So here we are on Friday, right back where we started. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it? Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

Nvidia reported $57B in Q3 revenueÂ (62% YoY growth), exceeding Wall Street forecasts. Profits surged toÂ $31.9B, signaling unstoppable AI demand. CEO Jensen Huang declared AI adoption is accelerating globally, with Blackwell GPUs "off the charts" and cloud GPUs "sold out." Nvidia jumped 5% in after-hours trading, nearingÂ $196. Big Tech (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) saw gains. Crypto-linked stocks reboundedÂ (Coinbase, MicroStrategy) as Bitcoin recovered toÂ 91,500 after dipping below 89K. InvestorÂ Michael BurryÂ warned of inflated earnings due to understated data center depreciation. Major players likeÂ Peter Thiel and SoftBank cashed outÂ (SoftBank sold itsÂ $5.8B stake). AI is replacingÂ 80% to 90% of customer service jobsÂ and expanding into creative fields (writing, design). Analysts warn ofÂ job displacement, privacy risks, bias and existential threatsÂ from unchecked AI growth. Nvidia's dominance confirms AI's explosive growth, but sustainability is uncertain. GPU demand remains high, but history showsÂ bubbles eventually burstâinvestors should weigh AI's transformative potential against its disruptive consequences.

Nvidia's record-breaking third-quarter earnings report has sent shockwaves through global markets, fueling a surge in AI and crypto-related stocks while temporarily alleviating fears of an artificial intelligence bubble. The semiconductor giant's staggering performanceâbolstered by unprecedented demand for its AI computing platformsâhas reignited investor optimism, lifting Bitcoin, Big Tech and mining stocks in after-hours trading. Nvidia reportedÂ 57 billion in revenue for Q3, a 62% increase compared to the same period last year and surpasses Wall Street's projections ofÂ 54.7 billion. Profits soared toÂ 31.9 billion, up 65 billion (Â±2%)Â further signaled that AI adoption shows no signs of slowing. CEOÂ Jensen HuangÂ declared, "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out." He emphasized that AI adoption is accelerating globally, stating, "We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fastâwith more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." CFOÂ Colette KressÂ added that Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra architecture is now its leading platform, while older Blackwell models continue to see strong demand. Notably, she downplayed revenue from the China-specificÂ H20 chip, calling it "insignificant"âa nod to U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia's earnings acted as a catalyst for broader market optimism: Nvidia (NVDA)Â surged 5% in after-hours trading, reachingÂ 196 after closing at 186.52. Big TechÂ stocksâApple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)âall posted gains. Crypto-linked equitiesÂ rebounded, with Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) edging higher. Bitcoin mining stocksÂ saw dramatic jumps, led byÂ Cipher Mining (+13%),Â IREN (+10%) andÂ Marathon Digital (+4%), as miners pivot toward AI data center operations. Bitcoin itself clawed back from aÂ 24-hour low of $88,540âits first dip below $89,000 since late AprilâtoÂ 91,500 following Nvidia's report. Ether (ETH) also recovered above 3,000Â after briefly sinking belowÂ $2,900. AI bubble concerns persist Despite the rally, skepticism remains. InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use. Meanwhile, major investors are cashing out: Peter Thiel's hedge fundÂ dumped itsÂ $100 million Nvidia stake. SoftBankÂ sold its entireÂ $5.8 billion positionÂ to fund its own AI ambitions. AI workforce disruption looms While Nvidia's success underscores AI's explosive growth, analysts warn of its societal impact. AI is rapidly displacing human rolesâfrom customer service (handlingÂ 80% to 90% of inquiries) to creative fields like writing and design. As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst. Investors riding the AI wave should tread carefully, recognizing both its transformative potential and disruptive consequences.

Sources include: Cointelegraph.com Ecoinimist.com Markets.com Yahoo!Finance.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Nvidia reportedÂ 57 billion in revenue for Q3, a 62% increase compared to the same period last year and surpasses Wall Street's projections ofÂ 54.7 billion. Profits soared toÂ 31.9 billion, up 65 billion (Â±2%)Â further signaled that AI adoption shows no signs of slowing. CEOÂ Jensen HuangÂ declared, "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out." He emphasized that AI adoption is accelerating globally, stating, "We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fastâwith more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." CFOÂ Colette KressÂ added that Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra architecture is now its leading platform, while older Blackwell models continue to see strong demand. Notably, she downplayed revenue from the China-specificÂ H20 chip, calling it "insignificant"âa nod to U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia's earnings acted as a catalyst for broader market optimism: Nvidia (NVDA)Â surged 5% in after-hours trading, reachingÂ 196 after closing at 186.52. Big TechÂ stocksâApple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)âall posted gains. Crypto-linked equitiesÂ rebounded, with Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) edging higher. Bitcoin mining stocksÂ saw dramatic jumps, led byÂ Cipher Mining (+13%),Â IREN (+10%) andÂ Marathon Digital (+4%), as miners pivot toward AI data center operations. Bitcoin itself clawed back from aÂ 24-hour low of $88,540âits first dip below $89,000 since late AprilâtoÂ 91,500 following Nvidia's report. Ether (ETH) also recovered above 3,000Â after briefly sinking belowÂ $2,900. AI bubble concerns persist Despite the rally, skepticism remains. InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use. Meanwhile, major investors are cashing out: Peter Thiel's hedge fundÂ dumped itsÂ $100 million Nvidia stake. SoftBankÂ sold its entireÂ $5.8 billion positionÂ to fund its own AI ambitions. AI workforce disruption looms While Nvidia's success underscores AI's explosive growth, analysts warn of its societal impact. AI is rapidly displacing human rolesâfrom customer service (handlingÂ 80% to 90% of inquiries) to creative fields like writing and design. As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst.

InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use.

Title: Why were stocks down today? What to know as Dow gives up 700-point gain
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2025/11/20/why-stocks-down-nov-20/87377901007/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T21:58:05Z

U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. "Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026," wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. "This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute," said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. "After all, after the headlines settle, stocks ultimately trade on earnings." And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. "NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat," said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. "Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth," she said. "Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. "Investors looking for an explanation for the current market pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced," said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. "Questions around the Fed’s interest-rate path, labor market, legal ruling on tariffs, and government shutdown are just a few of them. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result." The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. "Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we’re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy," Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering "what’s typically a seasonally strong stretch," Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase "Santa Claus rally." The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Shares of the world's most valuable company lost hold of their early gains after a blowout earnings report, while a big-box retailer soared after its latest quarterly results surpassed expectations. Major U.S. equities indexes finished Thursday's session in the red after overdue September jobs data sent mixed signals. The tech sector led the declines, as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back from their early advance in the wake of the AI chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results to close 3.2% lower. Nvidia was one of the day's worst-performing stocks in the Dow, which slid 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.2%. See here for more from Investopedia on Thursday's market action. Shares of other AI chipmakers lost ground along with Nvidia. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8% and Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2%, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index registering a nearly 5% decline. Nvidia memory chip partner Micron Technology (MU) tumbled 10.9%. Jacobs Solutions (J) shares lost the most of any stock in the S&P 500, dropping close to 11% after the engineering and consulting company reported a year-over-year decline in quarterly profits. The company said the results reflected a change in value of its investment in Amentum (AMTM), which was spun off from the company last year and combined its former intelligence arm with its cyber and critical mission solutions business. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its downtrend to hover around $87,000. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers crypto trading on its platform, dropped about 10%, while shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell 7.4%. Walmart (WMT) shares jumped nearly 7% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the retail giant's earnings topped analysts' estimates. Year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and advertising revenue helped drive the strong performance, in what could be a positive signal for U.S. consumer spending heading into the height of the holiday season. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of its Eylea HD eye treatment for patients with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Regulators also greenlighted a monthly dosing option for Eylea HD for patients a variety of eye conditions. Regeneron shares advanced 5%. Shares of Solventum (SOLV), the health care company that was spun off from 3M (MMM) last year, gained close to 3%. The push higher followed Solventum's announcement that it had agreed to acquire Acera Surgical, a bioscience firm focusing on regenerative wound care. Solventum is set to pay $725 million in cash for Acera, with up to $125 million in potential additional payments tied to reaching certain milestones.

Indian markets saw a dip on Thursday, November 20, 2025, as Nvidia's AI chip rally lost steam. Investors also lost hope for a December Federal Reserve rate cut. However, Walmart's strong sales and revenue figures for its fiscal third quarter provided a boost. The retail giant raised its annual forecasts, signaling confidence for the holiday season.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Somehow, Nvidia keeps raising the bar. The chip giant's stellar earnings for the third quarter have sparked a round of price-target raises from analysts who think the stock can climb even higher. Nvidia, the most expensive company in the world by market cap, pulled $57.01 billion in revenue, up 62% year-over-year. It estimated it would pull $65 billion the following quarter, handily beating expectations that it would issue guidance for around $61 billion in quarterly revenue. The results — and comments from CEO Jensen Huang that he believed AI was not in a bubble — was exactly what investors wanted to hear, according to Dan Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush. "Nvidia's earnings were another major validation moment for the AI Revolution and tech stocks. We also believe Nvidia will enter the $6 trillion market cap club over the next 12 to 18 months as the vision and numbers around the AI spending trend prove themselves out," he wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Here's the rundown of analysts who are also feeling more bullish on Nvidia's future: Brian Colello, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said he lifted his fair value estimate for the stock to $240 a share due to higher revenue expectations. Nvidia is paying more for input costs, but that will likely be offset by the company's strong pricing power, he added of the firm's profit outlook. "We still see Nvidia shares as undervalued and view recent AI bubble chatter as a buying opportunity. Longer-term concerns about AI funding and energy buildouts are valid in the medium to long term, but 2026 is shaping up to be another stellar AI year, in our view," Colello wrote. The new estimate implies 30% upside from the stock's current levels. Nvidia's latest results "answered the bell" as the chipmaker reported robust demand for its GB300 ramp, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. In the firm's base case, analysts see the Jensen Huang firm remaining the "dominant supplier" in the data center acceleration space. In the firm's upside scenario, analysts said they believed the stock could rise as high as $300 a share as the company takes over at least 80% of the data center ecosystem. "Industry checks suggest further upside with beats continuing as Blackwell ramps," they wrote of their long-term investment thesis on the stock. "See increased systems sales with the ramp of the GB200, further increasing the competitive moat." The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on Nvidia. Its new price target implies 35% upside from the stock's current levels. Analysts at Truist Financial said they raised their estimates on Nvidia partly because Jensen Huang's comment that AI wasn't in a bubble looked "increasingly believable." Bubble fears are the biggest overhang on Nvidia stock at the moment, the firm added. "On its conference call, NVDA noted that its A100 chips, which began shipping six years ago, are all still in the field and are running at 100% utilization. We believe this is the clearest indication that we are not in a bubble… at least not yet," the firm wrote in a client note. Nvidia also looks like it'll be lifted by its "solid" quarterly results and strong guidance over the near-term, they said. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Its new price target implies 37% upside from current levels. Analysts at Melius Research said they believed there were four things that mattered most in a note about the stock's outlook: "Revenue acceleration to 65%+ with this kind of margin at scale, benefiting from the greatest paradigm shift of my lifetime is worth more than ~25x next year's EPS," analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating. Its new price target implies 73% upside from the stock's current levels. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin, stocks crumble after Nvidia earnings and Fed uncertainty over next rate cut

Bitcoin weakness persists as the BTC price drops to $86,000, alongside a US stock market sell-off and diminishing odds of a 50-basis-point Fed interest rate cut at the next FOMC. Key takeaways: A Q1 2025 fractal and oversold market conditions suggest BTC could consolidate before retesting the $98,000 to $100,000 zone. One analyst made a bold price prediction, suggesting that a rising wedge breakdown could open the door to a deeper correction, potentially reaching $30,000. Bitcoin (BTC) jumped after Nvidia Corp.’s stronger-than-expected revenue outlook helped calm fears of an overheating AI bubble, but the gains quickly reversed as the Dow gave up a 700-point rally to turn negative and US stocks sold off. WHY are markets crashing? Our logical explanation:There is quite literally only ONE headline that can even be partially blamed for such a sudden market crash.At 11:20 AM ET, the US Labor Department said the November and October employment "situation" will be released on… pic.twitter.com/zubNQstd5l Bitcoin fell to a new monthly low of $86,400, and data suggest more downside could be on the way. Bitcoin’s recent pullback is echoing the same bullish reversal structure that unfolded in Q1 2025, said analyst Cas Abbé. Back then, BTC lost momentum near its fresh all-time high, slipped below a key support level and decoupled from a rising stock market before bottoming out in a multi-week accumulation range. Abbé’s chart below shows the pattern resurfaced almost identically in recent months, with the analyst adding that BTC will likely enter “consolidation between $85,000 to $100,000 for 3 to 4 weeks.” More importantly, both corrections were driven by broader macro fears. In Q1 2025, the sell-off was sparked by the US tariff war. This time, the catalyst has been panic over a potential AI bubble, anxieties that weighed heavily on tech stocks and spilled into crypto before Nvidia’s upbeat revenue outlook helped calm markets. The fractal raised Bitcoin’s odds of retesting $100,000 as resistance by year’s end. Analyst BitBull supported the bullish reversal outlook, though his view leans more on the technical structure of Bitcoin’s descending channel and its deeply oversold conditions as of Thursday. BTC traded near the lower boundary of this multi-week downtrend, an area that has repeatedly acted as an accumulation zone during previous corrections. Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory for the first time in months. Related: $90K Bitcoin price is a ‘close your eyes and bid’ opportunity: Analyst Together, BitBull argued, these signals mark potential local bottoms, adding that BTC “could rally toward $98,000 to 100,000” next. Analyst AlejandroBTC took a far more bearish stance, noting that Bitcoin has officially broken down from the large rising wedge pattern he has been warning about for months. In classical technical analysis, a rising wedge breakdown typically marks the end of a major trend, with the measured move indicating a significant decline. In this case, AlejandroBTC argues the structure projects a long-term target near the $30,000 region, a level that aligns with multiple historical support zones on the weekly chart.

The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%. Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%. Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years. Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum’s ether ETH$2,753.95, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high). A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.
