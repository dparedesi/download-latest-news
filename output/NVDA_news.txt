Title: Software taketh away faster than hardware giveth: Why C++ programmers keep growing fast despite competition, safety, and AI

Full Content:
Sutter’s Mill Herb Sutter on software development 2025 was another great year for C++. It shows in the numbers Before we dive into the data below, let’s put the most important question up front: Why have C++ and Rust been the fastest-growing major programming languages from 2022 to 2025? Primarily, it’s because throughout the history of computing “software taketh away faster than hardware giveth.” There is enduring demand for efficient languages because our demand for solving ever-larger computing problems consistently outstrips our ability to build greater computing capacity, with no end in sight. [6] Every few years, people wonder whether our hardware is just too fast to be useful, until the future’s next big software demand breaks across the industry in a huge wake-up moment of the kind that iOS delivered in 2007 and ChatGPT delivered in November 2022. AI is only the latest source of demand to squeeze the most performance out of available hardware. Quick quiz: What are the two biggest constraints on computing growth in 2025? What’s in shortest supply? Take a moment to answer that yourself before reading on… — — — If you answered exactly “power and chips,” you’re right — and in the right order. Chips are only our #2 bottleneck. It’s well known that the hyperscalars are competing hard to get access to chips. That’s why NVIDIA is now the world’s most valuable company, and TSMC is such a behemoth that it’s our entire world’s greatest single point of failure. But many people don’t realize: Power is the #1 constraint in 2025. Did you notice that all the recent OpenAI deals were expressed in terms of gigawatts? Let’s consider what three C-level executives said on their most recent earnings calls. [1] Amy Hood, Microsoft CFO (MSFT earnings call, October 29, 2025): [Microsoft Azure’s constraint is] not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power, is the language we use, to put them in. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO (AMZN earnings call, October 30, 2025): [AWS added] more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we’re now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we’re on track to double again by 2027. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO (NVDA earnings call, November 19, 2025): The most important thing is, in the end, you still only have 1 gigawatt of power. One gigawatt data centers, 1 gigawatt power. … That 1 gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly, absolutely directly, to your revenues. That’s why the future is enduringly bright for languages that are efficient in “performance per watt” and “performance per transistor.” The size of computing problems we want to solve has routinely outstripped our computing supply for the past 80 years; I know of no reason why that would change in the next 80 years. [2] The list of major portable languages that target those key durable metrics is very short: C, C++, and Rust. [3] And so it’s no surprise to see that in 2025 all three continued experiencing healthy growth, but especially C++ and Rust. Let’s take a look. Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand. (AI is not changing this, and will not change it; see Appendix.) “Global developer population trends 2025” (SlashData, 2025) reports that in the past three years the global developer population grew about 50%, from just over 31 million to just over 47 million. (Other sources are consistent with that: IDC forecasts that this growth will continue, to over 57 million developers by 2028. JetBrains reports similar numbers of professional developers; their numbers are smaller because they exclude students and hobbyists.) And which two languages are growing the fastest (highest percentage growth from 2022 to 2025)? Rust, and C++. To put C++’s growth in context: C++ is a living language whose core job to be done is to make the most of hardware, and it is continually evolving to stay relevant to the changing hardware landscape. The new C++26 standard contains additional support for hardware parallelism on the latest CPUs and GPUs, notably adding more support for SIMD types for intra-CPU vector parallelism, and the std::execution Sender/Receiver model for general multi-CPU and GPU concurrency and parallelism. But wait — how could this growth be happening? Isn’t C++ “too unsafe to use,” according to a spate of popular press releases and tweets by a small number of loud voices over the past few years? Let’s tackle that next… C++’s rate of security vulnerabilities has been far overblown in the press primarily because some reports are counting only programming language vulnerabilities when those are a smaller minority every year, and because statistics conflate C and C++. Let’s consider those two things separately. First, the industry’s security problem is mostly not about programming language insecurity. Year after year, and again in 2025, in the MITRE “CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” (mitre.org, 2025) only three of the top 10 “most dangerous software weaknesses” are related to language safety properties. Of those three, two (out-of-bounds write and out-of-bounds read) are directly and dramatically improved in C++26’s hardened C++ standard library which does bounds-checking for the most widely used bounded operations (see below). And that list is only about software weaknesses, when more and more exploits bypass software entirely. Why are vulnerabilities increasingly not about language issues, or even about software at all? Because we have been hardening our software; this is why the cost of zero-day exploits has kept rising, from thousands to millions of dollars. So attackers stop pursuing that as much, and switch to target the next slowest animal in the herd. For example, “CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report” (CrowdStrike, 2025) reports that “79% of [cybersecurity intrusion] detections were malware-free,” not involving programming language exploits. Instead, there was huge growth not only in non-language exploits, but even in non-software exploits, including a “442% growth in vishing [voice phishing via phone calls and voice messages] operations between the first and second half of 2024.” Why go to the trouble of writing an exploit for a use-after-free bug to infect someone’s computer with malware which is getting more expensive every year, when it’s easier to do some cross-site scripting that doesn’t depend on a programming language, and it’s easier still to ignore the software entirely and just convince the user to tell you their password on the phone? Second, for the subset that is about programming language insecurity, the problem child is C, not C++. A serious problem is that vulnerability statistics almost always conflate C and C++; it’s very hard to find good public sources that distinguish them. The only reputable public study I know of that distinguished between C and C++ is Mend.io’s as reported in “What are the most secure programming languages?” (Mend.io, 2019). Although the data is from 2019, as you can see the results are consistent across years. Can’t see the C++ bar? Pinch to zoom. 😉 Although C++’s memory safety has always been much closer to that of other modern popular languages than to that of C, we do have room for improvement and we’re doing even better in the newest C++ standard about to be released, C++26. It delivers two major security improvements, where you can just recompile your code as C++26 and it’s significantly more secure: Additionally, C++26 adds functional safety via contracts: preconditions, postconditions, and contract assertions in the language, that programmers can use to check that their programs behave as intended well beyond just memory safety. Beyond C++26, in the next couple of years I expect to see proposals to: I know of people who’ve been asking for C++ evolution to slow down a little to let compilers and users catch up, something like we did for C++03. But we like all this extra security, too. So, just spitballing here, but hypothetically: What if we focused C++29, the next release cycle of C++, to only issue-list-level items (bug fixes and polish, not new features) and the above “hardening” list (add more library hardening, remove more language undefined behavior)? I’m intrigued by this idea, not because security is C++’s #1 burning issue — it isn’t, C++ usage is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds — but because it could address both the “let’s pause to stabilize” and “let’s harden up even more” motivations. Focus is about saying no. Programming is growing fast. C++ is growing very fast, with a healthy long-term future because it’s deeply aligned with the overarching 80-year trend that computing demand always outstrips supply. C++ is a living language that continually adapts to its environment to fulfill its core mission, tracking what developers need to make the most of hardware. And it shows in the numbers. Here’s to C++’s great 2025, and its rosy outlook in 2026! I hope you have an enjoyable rest of the holiday period, and see you again in 2026. Thanks to Saeed Amrollahi Boyouki, Mark Hoemmen and Bjarne Stroustrup for motivating me to write this post and/or providing feedback. Finally, let’s talk about the topic no article can avoid: AI. C++ is foundational to current AI. If you’re running AI, you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar) — directly or indirectly — and if you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar), you’re probably running C++. CUDA is primarily available as a C++ extension. There’s always room for DSLs at the leading edge, but for general-purpose AI most high-performance deployment and inference is implemented in C++, even if people are writing higher-level code in other languages (e.g., Python). But more broadly than just C++: What about AI generally? Will it take all our jobs? (Spoiler: No.) AI is a wonderful and transformational tool that greatly reduces rote work, including problems that have already been solved, where the LLM is trained on the known solutions. But AI cannot understand, and therefore can’t solve, new problems — which is most of the current and long-term growth in our industry. What does that imply? Two main things, in my opinion… First, I think that people who think AI isn’t a major game-changer are fooling themselves. To me, AI is on par with the wheel (back in the mists of time), the calculator (back in the 1970s), and the Internet (back in the 1990s). [5] Each of those has been a game-changing tool to accelerate (not replace) human work, and each led to more (not less) human production and productivity. I strongly recommend checking out Adam Unikowsky’s “Automating Oral Argument” (Substack, July 7, 2025). Unikowsky took his own actual oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court and showed how well 2025-era Claude can do as a Supreme Court-level lawyer, and with what strengths and weaknesses. Search for “Here is the AI oral argument” and click on the audio player, which is a recording of an actual Supreme Court session and replaces only Unikowsky’s responses with his AI-generated voice saying the AI-generated text argument directly responding to each of the justices’ actual questions; the other voices are the real Supreme Court justices. (Spoiler: “Objectively, this is an outstanding oral argument.”) Second, I think that people who think AI is going to put a large fraction of programmers out of work are fooling themselves. We’ve just seen that, today, three years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the number of human programmers is growing as fast as ever. Even the companies that are the biggest boosters of the “AI will replace programmers” meme are actually aggressively growing, not reducing, their human programmer workforces. Consider what three more C-level executives are saying. Sam Schillace, Microsoft Deputy CTO (Substack, December 19, 2025) is pretty AI-ebullient, but I do agree with this part he says well, and which resonates directly with Unikowsky’s experience above: If your job is fundamentally “follow complex instructions and push buttons,” AI will come for it eventually. But that’s not most programmers. Matt Garman, Amazon Web Services CEO (interview with Matthew Berman, X, August 2025) says bluntly: People were telling me [that] with AI we can replace all of our junior people in our company. I was like that’s … one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard. … I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job. But it doesn’t mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them. Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian CEO (Stratechery interview, December 2025) says it well: I think [AI]’s a huge force multiplier personally for human creativity, problem solving … If software costs half as much to write, I can either do it with half as many people, but [due to] core competitive forces … I will [actually] need the same number of people, I would just need to do a better job of making higher quality technology. … People shouldn’t be afraid of AI taking their job … they should be afraid of someone who’s really good at AI [and therefore more efficient] taking their job. So if we extend the question of “what are our top constraints on software?” to include not only hardware and power, the #3 long-term constraint is clear: We are chronically short of skilled human programmers. Humans are not being replaced en masse, not most of us; we are being made more productive, and we’re needed more than ever. As I wrote above: “Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand.” [1] It’s actually great news that Big Tech is spending heavily on power, because the gigawatt capacity we build today is a long-term asset that will keep working for 15 to 20+ years, whether the companies that initially build that capacity survive or get absorbed. That’s important because it means all the power generation being built out today to satisfy demand in the current “AI bubble” will continue to be around when the next major demand for compute after AI comes along. See Ben Thompson’s great writing, such as “The Benefits of Bubbles” (Stratechery, November 2025). [2] The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy contains two opposite ideas, both fun but improbable: (1) The problem of being “too compute-constrained”: Deep Thought, the size of a city, wouldn’t really be allowed to run for 7.5 million years; you’d build a million cities. (2) The problem of having “too much excess compute capacity”: By the time a Marvin with a “brain the size of a planet” was built, he wouldn’t really be bored; we’d already be trying to solve problems the size of the solar system. [3] This is about “general-purpose” coding. Code at the leading specialized edges will always include use of custom DSLs. [4] This means that compiling plain C code (that is in the C/C++ intersection) as C++26 also automatically makes it more correct and more secure. This isn’t new; compiling C code as C++ and having the C code be more correct has been true since the 1980s. [5] If you’re my age, you remember when your teacher fretted that letting you use a calculator would harm your education. More of you remember similar angsting about letting students google the internet. Now we see the same fears with AI — as if we could stop it or any of those others even if we should. And we shouldn’t; each time, we re-learn the lesson that teaching students to use such tools should be part of their education because using tools makes us more productive. [6] This is not the same as Wirth’s Law, that “software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.” Wirth’s observation was that the overheads of operating systems and higher-level runtimes and other costly abstractions were becoming ever heavier over time, so that a program to solve the same problem was getting more and more inefficient and soaking up more hardware capacity than it used to; for example, printing “Hello world” really does take far more power and hardware when written in modern Java than it did in Commodore 64 BASIC. That doesn’t apply to C++ which is not getting slower over time; C++ continues to be at least as efficient as low-level C for most uses. No, the key point I’m making here is very different: that the problems the software is tackling are growing faster than hardware is becoming faster.

Title: 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy if You Want to Outperform Next Year

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Cherdchai101 / Shutterstock.com The past year has been a continuation of an unceasing tech rally, one that may continue well into 2026 and beyond. If you are a strong believer in that, looking into Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) can help you outperform the broader market significantly. All three are riding the AI megatrend and have strong revenue visibility beyond 2026. These companies are on the “frontline” when it comes to AI hardware. Data centers are being built out at a record pace, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not the only company that is benefiting from it. The market is starting to move past NVDA stock and is pouring into other satellite AI beneficiaries who are seeing explosive upward momentum one after the other. Let’s take a look at why the following three can win big next year. If you’ve built a PC anytime soon, you’ll know that random-access memory (RAM) prices have been soaring. Certain RAM chips have seen their prices quintuple or more in a matter of weeks. This is thanks to stubborn demand from data centers outpacing supply. One would logically say: how can I benefit from this instead of losing out like every other consumer? Micron is a medium to do just that. This company sells semiconductors like DRAM, RAM, NAND flash, SSDs, and similar items that are seeing record demand from data centers. It is seeing demand so strong that the company’s management has decided to exit the consumer market and is now focusing on enterprise clients. I believe this will increase margins significantly, as the consumer market has lower margins. Companies are willing to pay far more, especially at a time when it is becoming harder to secure supplies for data centers. Every hyperscaler is rushing to build as much as possible, and Micron is well-positioned to benefit from that. Analysts expect the RAM market to remain tight through 2026, possibly stretching into 2027 or even 2028. Thus, I see MU stock outperforming in 2026. It has delivered over 226% in year-to-date 2025 gains (as of writing). Western Digital is in a similar market, but it supplies another crucial component that data centers need. It focuses on hard drives and solid-state drives. If you use a computer, you certainly have those components being used, and data centers are putting them into use even more aggressively. AI training needs petabytes (thousands of terabytes) of data. The amount of data needed is only increasing as the AI battle heats up. It’s not just text AI that is being trained by companies now. Image AI models and video AI models need even more data, as they often train on 4K videos. The meteoric increase in demand has translated into the stock price exploding by over 288% year-to-date. You’re still paying just 23 times forward earnings for FY 2026 (ends in June 2026). I expect a lot more upside as FY 2026 EPS growth is expected at 58%. It may prove to be an underestimate if data center demand again proves to be sticky. ACM Research makes equipment for semiconductor fabrication, particularly wet cleaning systems (SAPS, Tahoe) and electroplating (ECP) tools. This is a U.S.-based company, but the twist is that it owns a much larger Chinese company called ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc. That Chinese arm is worth $12.2 billion, of which 74.6% is owned by ACM Research. This equals $9.1 billion, well over the $2.64 billion market capitalization on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This discrepancy was called out by Kerrisdale Capital in January of this year, where ACMR stock was called a “10-Bagger”. ACMR stock is up over 132% since then, and I believe it can go much higher. Financials are still excellent, and the Chinese arm maintains market dominance. The company can also skirt geopolitical tensions (as it has done recently) due to the Chinese arm being separate. Analysts expect nearly 16% revenue growth for all of 2025 and 18.3% revenue growth next year. You’re paying less than 20 times forward earnings for the stock, though that is irrelevant considering the large discrepancy between the Shanghai arm and the U.S.-traded entity makes it a bargain-basement buy.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after two consecutive sessions of losses for major indexes; tech stocks have stabilized after slumping on Monday; gold and silver prices are surging after the precious metals posted steep declines to start the week; Facebook-parent Meta announced it acquired AI agent firm Manus. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are holding steady this morning after major indexes lost ground on Monday for the second straight session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were hovering near unchanged in recent trading. Bitcoin was at $87,900, up from an overnight low of around $87,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates and costs on other consumer loans, was at 4.14%, up from 4.12% at yesterday's close. Oil prices continued to climb amid tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 0.3% at $58.30 per barrel, trading near their highest levels of the month. Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies are back on firmer footing Tuesday after leading the market's downturn yesterday.Concerns about whether major tech companies will profit from massive investments in artificial intelligence have weighed on investor sentiment in recent months. In premarket trading Tuesday, Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 0.5%, after the stock fell 3.3% on Monday to lead Nasdaq decliners. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) inched higher after shedding more than 1% yesterday, while Palantir (PLTR) ticked higher after dropping more than 2% Monday and Oracle (ORCL) was little changed after sliding 1%. Gold and silver prices are bouncing back from the big declines posted yesterday after exchange operator CME Group made a key change to its metals contracts. Gold futures were recently up 1.7% at $4,415 an ounce, after sliding as low as $4,330 yesterday. Silver futures were up more than 7% this morning, at around $75.55 an ounce. After a weeks-long rally that had lifted the precious metals to a series of record highs, gold and silver plunged on Monday after CME raised its margin requirements for precious metals contracts. Higher margin requirements require traders to add money to accounts that insure against default, effectively raising their costs to trade the futures contracts. Traders will be watching today’s release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting for clues about the direction the Federal Reserve will take on interest rates in 2026. The minutes, which are set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, will provide more insight into the FOMC’s decision to cut the Fed's benchmark lending rate for a third straight meeting. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when it meets in January, though rising unemployment levels, along with tame inflation readings, could put pressure on FOMC members to reduce borrowing costs again. Investors will also be monitoring home price data set to be released at 9 a.m. ET. Meta Platforms (META) announced it acquired Manus, a Singapore-based firm that develops autonomous general-purpose AI agents. In a release, Meta said that Manus agents are able to “independently execute complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.” Meta said it would integrate Manus services into its offerings. The move by the Facebook parent company comes as it continues to make big investments in its AI business. Shares of Meta, which through Monday's close were up 13% in 2025, were little changed in premarket trading.

Title: Bitcoin’s $90K rejection: Is BTC's digital gold narrative losing to bonds?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-90k-rejection-is-btc-digital-gold-narrative-losing-to-bonds
Time Published: 2025-12-30T10:40:43Z

Bitcoin's recovery relied on a shift toward the "digital gold" narrative, but global growth risks and strong equity markets have delayed that breakout. Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Bitcoin failed to break $90,000 again as investors favored gold and bonds. S&P 500 record highs and lower interest rates have reduced Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge compared to traditional equities. Bitcoin (BTC) faced strong rejection near $90,000 on Monday, triggering nearly $100 million in liquidations across leveraged positions. Strong demand for traditional hedges such as gold and US government bonds led traders to question whether Bitcoin has the momentum needed to reclaim the $100,000 level. Gold prices held above $4,300 on Monday, while yields on the two-year US Treasury fell to their lowest level since August 2022. Rising demand for government-backed assets signals broader risk aversion, particularly as the US fiscal deficit is expected to widen in 2026. The US Treasury also faces the difficult task of rolling over roughly $10 trillion in debt throughout the year. Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer of the Rockefeller Global Family Office, told Reuters: Meanwhile, the negative impact of US import tariffs on economic growth has been offset by massive spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to Yahoo Finance. Investor sentiment has deteriorated since the US Department of Labor reported the November US unemployment rate at 4.6%, the highest level in four years. Under normal circumstances, such data would lead traders to raise expectations for a more aggressive stimulus stance from the US Federal Reserve. But this time, inflation risks have become a significant constraint. Even so, the S&P 500 surged to a new all-time high in December, adding to discomfort among Bitcoin investors. If the Fed continues to trim interest rates, equities tend to move higher due to the direct impact on corporate balance sheets. Lower capital costs support higher valuations, while consumer credit conditions also improve. As a result, Bitcoin’s appeal as an independent hedge becomes less compelling. Bitcoin’s difficulty in holding the $90,000 level reflects traders’ risk perceptions, as the cryptocurrency has yet to establish itself as a reliable store of value amid a global recession. If investments in artificial intelligence deliver the expected returns, major tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT US), Nvidia (NVDA US) and Google (GOOG) could unlock additional valuation upside, potentially pushing equity markets to new all-time highs. Bitcoin mining has also moved into focus amid rising energy costs. Investors worry that miners are operating at extremely low, or even negative, margins. Tighter operating cash flows have pushed miners to rely more frequently on debt and equity-linked financing to maintain liquidity, including secondary share offerings. Meanwhile, the network hash rate has edged lower after peaking in late October. However, VanEck analysts argue that Bitcoin miner capitulation is “historically a bullish contrarian signal.” A report by VanEck crypto research lead Matt Sigel noted that Bitcoin’s 90-day forward returns have historically been positive 65% of the time following 30-day periods of network hashrate decline. The report attributed the recent drop in hash rate to the shutdown of 1.3 gigawatts of mining capacity in China. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Another factor behind investors’ reluctance to add exposure near the $87,000 level is the compression in valuation multiples among digital reserve asset companies. There is little incentive to issue shares below the market value of their underlying Bitcoin holdings. For example, Strategy (MSTR US) traded at a 16% discount, while Twenty One Capital (XXI US) was valued 18% below its reserves, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on a shift in risk perception that favors the digital gold narrative. This process may take longer as attention remains focused on global economic growth risks.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, powering much of the infrastructure behind generative AI and data centers. This demand propelled its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion, supported by a roughly 39% year-to-date gain in its stock price. Yet concerns persist about increasing competition from rivals and a potential slowdown in AI spending, raising fears of an AI bubble burst. While the stock’s performance may feel disappointing to some investors after explosive gains in prior years, a near-40% return would have been phenomenal for Nvidia 10 years ago. But had you had the foresight to invest $10,000 in the stock in early January 2016 and hold through today, the results tell a remarkable story of transformation. It is important to see where Nvidia came from over the past decade to understand where it stands today. In early 2016, Nvidia primarily focused on graphics processing units for PC gaming. Its GeForce lineup dominated the market for video game graphics accelerators, delivering high-performance visuals for gamers. The company generated record annual revenue in fiscal 2016, largely from its gaming segment, which accounted for about three quarters of the total. At the time, AI applications remained in their infancy and had not yet entered the public consciousness as a viable technology for changing industry and the world around us. Back then, Nvidia’s data center business was small, generating only $339 million for all of 2015. The stock traded at split-adjusted prices around $0.80 per share as the new year began, accounting for subsequent splits, including the 4-for-1 split in 2021 and the 10-for-1 split in 2024. Nvidia’s evolution accelerated in the late 2010s. The metaverse was a thing for 15 minutes until cryptocurrency mining surged between 2017 and 2018, with miners using Nvidia GPUs for proof-of-work algorithms in coins like Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). This drove unexpected demand, boosting gaming segment revenue despite volatility — Nvidia noted crypto’s contributions but maintained its focus on its core gaming GPUs. As crypto mining waned after several market crashes, Nvidia shifted toward AI and deep learning. Researchers had used its GPUs for machine learning since the early 2010s, and the company released products like the DGX-1 in 2016 for AI training. Explosive growth in generative AI after 2022 — ChatGPT was released in late November that year the public began to take notice — cemented Nvidia as the premier AI chipmaker, with its data center segment now dominating. Nvidia’s revenue transformation has been just as dramatic. Where 2016 annual revenue stood at $5 billion, Nvidia reported $57 billion in revenue for just the third quarter of fiscal 2026 — exceeding the entire 2016 yearly figure tenfold in just three months. Its stock price growth mirrored this shift. From those penny-per-share split-adjusted levels near January 2016, Nvidia is currently trading above $187 per share today. This represents a price appreciation of over 23,600%. Considering Nvidia’s entire market cap was about $17 billion a decade ago, it’s not surprising to learn you would be sitting on a not-so-small fortune with it priced at $4.5 trillion. But how big is big? Over the last 10 years, Nvidia’s total return — yes, the chipmaker pays a nominal dividend yielding 0.02% — would have turned a $10,000 investment in early January 2016 into more than $2.37 million.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trading lower as we begin the final trading week of 2025, albeit a holiday-shortened one once again. The major indices all finished the session modestly lower on Friday, with the venerable S&P 500 taking early bows as it hit a fresh all-time high, joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, which recently entered all-time high territory. With just two full trading days left in the year, you can expect some volatility this week as investors and traders make final portfolio adjustments to close out the year. With sellers sneaking in late Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial closed at 48,710, down 0.04%, while the aforementioned S&P 500 backed off its intra-day all-time high print to close at 6.929 down 0.03%. The Nasdaq finished the day at 21,593, down 0.09%. Yields were flat to moderately lower on Friday as portfolio shuffling and some light profit-taking seemed to be the order for the day. The strong GDP data have challenged expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts next year, supporting a more hawkish stance among some Fed officials. Market pricing currently implies up to two rate cuts in 2026, while the median policymaker projection points to only one. Goldman Sachs said in the fall that it expects two more 25-basis-point reductions in 2026. The 30-year long bond closed Friday at 4.82% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.13%. Both major oil benchmarks closed lower on Friday, with analysts pointing to the usual thin post-holiday trading as concerns about a looming global supply glut outweigh geopolitical supply risks, despite recent disruptions from actions against Venezuela and the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Brent Crude closed the day at $60.87, down 2.2%, while West Texas Intermediate finished Friday’s session at $56.94, down 2.2%. The big winner on Friday was Natural Gas, which had taken a beating over the previous two weeks, as it surged 3.5% higher to close at $4.39. Analysts cited cold weather, high LNG exports, and tighter storage levels, which are expected to drive winter demand upward despite warmer spells. Plus, short covering after a 20%+ move down was a possible reason for the gains. Gold continued to race higher after smashing through the $4500 mark earlier in the week, to finish Friday at $4,494. More positive coverage at Goldman Sachs, which sees the precious metal hitting $4,900 in 2026 and says “Gold remains our single favorite long commodity,” was a factor in Friday’s move higher. Silver also continued on a moonshot parabolic move, closing Friday at $75.98. Both remain at all-time highs, and investors could see additional substantial gains as we head into 2026. The crypto market saw another day of high volatility and generally mixed to lower trading on Friday, with major assets like Bitcoin initially rising modestly before sliding later in the day due to the typical thin holiday liquidity and a surge in precious metals pricing that drew significant investor capital in end-of-year moves. At 8 a.m. EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $87,580, while Ethereum was seen at $2,962. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.
