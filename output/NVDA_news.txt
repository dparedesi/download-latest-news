Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception. In 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the "Magnificent Seven." And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips. Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday. There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings. But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be. Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023. AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware. “We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report. On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware. Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne. “Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.” There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs. For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%. That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter. Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings. Check out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance The bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it’s just another investing trend.

Title: Mizuho Raises NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target to $175, Reaffirms Outperform Rating Amid Strong AI Market Leadership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ChatGPT updates, warehouse robots, and special agents: This week's AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI announced this week that it’s starting to roll out Advanced Voice Mode on the web browser version of ChatGPT. Paid users of ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu will be able to start a real-time conversation on the ChatGPT website. The AI startup also announced that it updated its GPT-4o model’s creative writing ability to have “more natural, engaging, and tailored writing.” The updated model can also work better with uploaded files, OpenAI said. The Allen Institute for AI announced its Tülu 3 family of open, fine-tuned models this week. The fine-tuning, or post-training, process refines models to perform specific tasks. Through Tülu 3, developers and researchers can find open-source data sets, model training recipes, code, and evaluation frameworks. The models range from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions, according to Ai2. Enveda, a biotech company that uses AI to turn natural compounds into new medicines, announced an oversubscribed $130 million Series C funding round this week. The round was led by Kinnevik and FPV, and brings Enveda’s total funding to $360 million. The funding will help the company with advancing its pipeline of ten development drug candidates. Enveda is building an AI-powered platform called a “sequencer” “that combines metabolomics data with machine learning and high-throughput biological experiments to answer two fundamental questions of any natural sample at scale: (1) What are the molecules?, and (2) What do they do?,” the company said. “Some of the world’s greatest pharmaceutical breakthroughs have been derived from just 0.1% of nature’s chemistry,” Viswa Colluru, chief executive of Enveda, said in a statement. “We developed our platform to rapidly expand access to nature’s chemistry to find therapeutics at roughly four times the speed–and it’s already delivering results in the form of a deep and differentiated pipeline. This funding will help us advance multiple candidates to exciting clinical catalysts in the next year, confirming our guiding vision that life’s chemistry is an excellent source for new medicines.” Pickle Robot, which develops robotic automation systems for unloading trucks, announced a $50 million Series B funding round this week. The company, which calls itself a pioneer of physical AI, also announced that six customers have ordered over 30 production robots in the third quarter for deployment in early 2025. Pickle Robot’s physical AI technology combines a vision system with generative AI foundation models trained on millions of real logistics and warehouse operations data. “Pickle Robot customers are experiencing the value of Physical AI applied to a common logistics process that challenges thousands of operations every day,” AJ Meyer, chief executive and founder of Pickle Robot, said in a statement. “The new funding and our strategic customer relationships enable Pickle to chart the future of supply chain robotics, rapidly expand our core product capabilities, and grow our business to deliver tremendous customer value now and in the future.” Lightning AI, the company behind the PyTorch Lightning deep learning framework, announced a $50 million equity investment this week that included Nvidia (NVDA) and J.P. Morgan (JPM). PyTorch Lightning has received over 160 million downloads since Lightning AI launched a year ago. Lightning AI combines dozens of separate AI development tools on one, multi-cloud platform where developers can build, train, and deploy AI models, and host AI apps securely. “Building your own AI platform today is like building your own Slack — it’s complex, costly, and not core to your business,” William Falcon, founder and chief executive of Lightning AI, said in a statement. “The value for enterprises lies in their data, domain knowledge, and unique models — not in maintaining AI infrastructure. We have thousands of developers single-handedly training and deploying models at a scale that would have required teams of developers without Lightning.” Thoughtful AI launched its specialized AI agents for revenue cycle management in healthcare this week. The AI-powered revenue cycle transformation company’s new agents include CODY for coding and notes review, and CAM for claims processing. “Our team of AI Agents turn RCM from a bottleneck into a powerhouse, using AI and automation to tackle tedious, time-consuming tasks so that healthcare teams can optimize revenue and focus on what matters most – patients,” Alex Zekoff, co-founder and chief executive of Thoughtful AI, said in a statement. Reforged Labs, an AI-powered video creation service for mobile game studios, launched its AI-powered video ad service this week that it says can deliver tailored, cost-effective ads in less than 24 hours. The startup’s proprietary AI engine was trained with thousands of game ads, Reforged Labs said. “We want to help level the playing field for game studios with limited resources,” Robert Huynh, chief executive and co-founder of Reforged Labs, said in a statement. “With our full-service creative solution that’s tailored for game marketing, studios can benefit from proven ad templates and AI-driven production and editing, all without lengthy briefs or big budgets.”

Title: 3 Nvidia customers have each spent $10 billion on chips this year

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.06%) path to becoming the most valuable public company in the world this year has been laid by its artificial intelligence chips and a handful of anonymous customers. Earlier this week, the chipmaker reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. According to the company’s Form 10-Q, 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — came from only three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, the filing said. The filing also shows that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. That means Customers B and C have each spent around $10 billion on Nvidia’s tech so far this year, while Customer D has spent almost $11 billion. Nvidia reported revenues of $26 billion for the fiscal first quarter, and $30 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to the filing. In September, Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing showed four anonymous customers made up nearly half of its $30 billion revenues for the second fiscal quarter. Sales from the four customers represented about 46% of total quarterly revenue, or $13.8 billion. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in both 10-Q filings. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.76%), Meta (META+1.10%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.26%), and Tesla (TSLA+0.23%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. Nvidia’s record fiscal third-quarter revenue was up 94% from a year ago. The company set its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which was slightly above expectations.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Friday as investors surveyed President-elect Donald Trump's efforts to build his team and bitcoin's (BTC-USD) bid to reach a key milestone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 250 points or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped between positive and negative territory, after the major gauges closed Thursday in the green. Markets are regrouping after Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings fell short of definitively settling the question of whether AI would keep boosting stocks. Some of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacap stocks were under pressure in early trading, also dogged by the potential breakup of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).T The major gauges are still on track to close the week with wins of over 1%, despite getting it off to a lackluster start as the post-election rally stalled. Wall Street is still waiting to learn who Trump will tap for his Treasury Secretary — an announcement that could sway markets, given its importance to the economy. The President-elect tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after his prior pick, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday. Meanwhile, surging bitcoin continued to near the landmark $100,000 level, buoyed by growing confidence that the Trump administration will support pro-crypto policies. The leading token broke above $99,500 early on Friday before retreating amid hopes for looser regulatory oversight after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he will step down soon. Smaller cryptocurrencies also got a boost. On the data front, a monthly update on consumer sentiment is due later. The first S&P Global readings from US factory and services activity surveys in November are also on the docket. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Reddit (RDDT) stock fell over 8% in early trading Friday as investors reacted to a Bloomberg report that a company shareholder — Conde Nast parent Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. — is looking to establish a credit facility using its stake in the social media platform. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. is offering 7.8 million shares for $145.38 to $148.54 each, which would be valued at as much as $1.2 billion. That price range represented as much as an 8% discount on Reddit's closing price Thursday of $158. Reddit stock has been on a massive rally over the past month, surging more than 90% since its earnings beat in late October. The social media company went public in March in one of 2024's few hot IPOs, surging nearly 50% after its debut. Shares rose 16% on Thursday alone. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 250 points, or 0.6%, shortly after the market open as shares of Home Depot (HD), Honeywell (HON), and Nike (NKE) rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) stepped above the flat line. Stocks wavered at the open on Friday, but the major averages were still on track to end the week with wins. Meanwhile, investors watched the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD), with the leading token trading a stone's throw away from $100,000. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose slightly, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) shares extended losses after dropping more than 4% on Thursday amid the threat of a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Bitcoin climbed above $99,400 early on Friday before retreating. The cryptocurrency has been on fire since Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month, amid optimism that his incoming administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. By 9:30 a.m. ET, bitcoin was trading at just under $98,000. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) neared the $100,000 level Friday in its latest flirtation with the milestone. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports on bitcoin's recent surge, up nearly 50% in the past month: The most-held cryptocurrency has been surging since the US presidential election as the crypto community expects a more friendly regulatory regime with President-elect Trump as "HODLer-in-chief." That added to an already torrid rally this year, prompted by the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs. On the policy front, encouraging signs have been mounting: Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly met with Trump to discuss his picks for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And SEC boss Gary Gensler and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, seen as crypto foes by the industry, are stepping down around Inauguration Day. Read the full story here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) stock price rose by 15.1% to $29.70 on November 21, 2024, following a series of significant developments. This marked a remarkable recovery and restored investor confidence despite ongoing controversies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. The recent surge is coming into the market after SMCI cleared all the compliance issues between it and Nasdaq by appointing BDO USA as their new auditors. This action comes after a somewhat volatile time for the company, which saw its financial reports delayed and the ouster of its prior auditor, Ernst & Young. The appointment of BDO, the fifth largest accounting firm globally, alongside presenting a compliance plan, helped the company put off immediate wipe-out risks, which was a significant achievement in stabilization. The semiconductor industry has received further support from Nvidia's (NVDA, Financial) Q3, FY 2025 results, which depict a healthy demand for AI. Nvidia's results reflected strong revenue and earnings growth and placed a favorable spotlight on system partners such as SMCI. Although Nvidia shares declined on profit selling, the prolonged favorable industry fundamentals and the increase continued driving up the SMCI shares. However, coupled with these developments are some challenges that Super Micros is experiencing, some of which are the accounting fraud allegations made by Hindenburg research early this year. The ability of the company to address these issues while sustaining solid linkages is likely to continue to be an area of interest to investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. The legendary investor reduced his stake is some very well-known companies. An incoming crypto-friendly regulatory environment for U.S. based companies has renewed optimism for certain tokens, especially XRP. Rather than feeling surprised, you should take advantage of such scenarios to scoop up solid growth stocks on the cheap. Ideally, these businesses should be growing their revenue and profits and generating positive free cash flow. Most importantly, these growth stocks should possess catalysts that help them post sustainable growth in the years ahead. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is reporting tremendous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). It supplies these chips for gaming, data centers, automotive, and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. All that demand is generating plenty of excess revenue for Nvidia and the company is looking for ways to put that money to good use. This eVTOL aircraft maker could have a bright future. Nowhere is that more apparent than the stunning rise of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, a collection known for its strong ties to the technology. Billionaire investors have taken notice, and many hold positions in the Magnificent Seven stocks. Among these closely watched billionaires is Philippe Laffont, who made a name for himself by building Coatue Management into the world's best-known tech-centric hedge fund, parlaying a $50 million investment in 1999 into $27 billion in assets under management. BioLineRx (BLRX) and Ayrmid, the parent company of Gamida Cell (GMDA), announced that the companies entered into a license agreement for motixafortide, BioLineRx’s FDA-approved stem cell mobilization agent indicated in combination with filgrastim for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, BioLineRx granted Ayrmid an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Aphexda across all indications, excluding solid tumo Rising costs of living and shrinking savings force millions of Americans to consider retiring overseas.

We recently published a list of 14 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. Merely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. News publication The Wall Street Journal reported that Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz were part of the raise, while the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar also participated in the funding process. This set of investors had also backed the startup with $6 billion in funding earlier this year. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. xAI has developed Grok, one of the leading AI chatbots in the world. It rivals the performance of chatbots from tech powerhouses with far greater resources. The firm also controls Colossus, one of the most powerful supercomputers globally. The supercomputer will become fully operational by the end of this year and Musk plans on expanding the hardware at the center of this endeavor to 200,000 GPUs. Last year, the startup also released PromptIDE, an integrated development environment designed for prompt engineering and interpretability research.

On November 20, Loop Capital maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $175 price. In an investor note, the advisory noted that there has been increased noise throughout the Gen AI ecosystem of late, but analysis suggests that Nvidia’s anticipated demand trajectory remains intact. The note further detailed that GB200 NVL72 at material volume was really a July-September 2025 event, but it may not matter much as the amount of increased Hopper production may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Gene Munster Is Bullish, Talks About Pressure Points on Nvidia’s (NVDA) Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster shared his views about NVIDIA (NVDA)'s earnings call yesterday. Here is a summary of his thoughts: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much. The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs. The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small. This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.” Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum. Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook. Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate. Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

After reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped expectations, Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) shares dipped in extended trading on Wednesday; investors wanted more action from the chip giant. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia projects sales of $37.5 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%. Although this advice is below some buy-side projections as high as $41 billion, it exceeds analyst predictions of $37.1 billion. With sales jumping 94% year-over-year to $35.08 billion, Nvidia posted adjusted profits of $0.81 per share for the quarter ended Oct. 27. While automobile income came in at $449 million, data center revenue came in at $30.8 billion, above projections of $29.14 billion. Revenue from professional visualization climbed 17% annually to $486 million. Gaming income for the quarter is at $3.3 billion, which is above projections of $3.06 billion and up 15% from the year before. With a 75% adjusted gross margin that matched projections, the business produced $16.79 billion in free cash flow. For the quarter, analysts had projected profits of $0.74 per share on $33.25 billion in sales. The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing, said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell in full production are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference. Huang added, AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure. According to the business, for many quarters into fiscal 2026 demand for their Blackwell chips is projected to surpass supply. Notwithstanding supply limits, Nvidia intends to keep delivering Hopper and Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Analyst Julian Lin noted on the direction that Nvidia lives in the "same mathematical reality." Following Nvidia's results, shares of rival semiconductor firms, including AMD (AMD, Financials), ARM (ARM, Financials), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials), and Intel (INTC, Financials), slumped in after-hours trade. With a record date of Dec. 5, Nvidia said it would pay a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to owners on Dec. 27. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Nvidia says next-gen Blackwell chip sales will top prior forecasts, calming delay worries

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected. The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time. Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that. Read more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest? “With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance. “And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.” But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand. “It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.” For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible. As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need. “Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.” In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday. This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

The Dow surged by over 570 points Thursday afternoon, buoyed by strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA-3.06%), which briefly hit a 52-week high of $152.89 per share earlier in the day. Meanwhile, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+10.44%) rose over 14% after Nvidia mentioned its partner during an earnings call on Wednesday. Considering Super Micro’s previous accounting issues, investors might feel reassured that the partnership is strong enough for the company to be featured. As a reseller of Nvidia’s GPUs and other components, Super Micro incorporates Nvidia’s technology into its servers to support AI workloads. The two companies have a long-standing relationship, and both CEOs—Charles Liang of Super Micro and Jensen Huang of Nvidia—are Taiwanese immigrants. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 572 points or 1.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.15% and 0.6%, respectively. The Russell 2000 Index, which is viewed as a barometer for small companies, added more than 1%. Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.06% shares hit a 52-week high early Thursday morning, dipped several hours later, and then rose again. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October were up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. The company’s quarterly data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the company’s Blackwell chip contributed significantly to its earnings growth. Bitcoin’s rally shows no signs of slowing, with the leading cryptocurrency surging past the $98,000 to hit a new all-time high. According to data from the crypto tracking platform CoinGecko, Bitcoin reached $98,310 on Thursday. This ascent follows the debut of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) options earlier this week—a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry. – Britney Nguyen contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia is in for larger beats as Blackwell rolls out, analysts say

Despite Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.06%) modest guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, analysts are anticipating larger earnings beats on strong demand for its new artificial intelligence platform. The chipmaker set its fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above expectations of $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.31%). Nvidia’s expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter were “likely hampered by ongoing Blackwell shipment constraints,” Kunjan Sobhani, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. Nvidia chief executive Colette Kress said both Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are facing certain supply constraints, and that Blackwell demand is expected to exceed supply into fiscal year 2026. The modest guidance sent Nvidia’s shares slightly down in after-hours trading on Wednesday into Thursday morning. “Unfortunately, market participants have become too short-term oriented,” Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Absolute good reports seem less interesting than relatively less good but still good. There is nothing wrong with NVDA, I suggest investors use any weakness to buy the stock because demand will be satisfied at some point and these slight misses will turn into big beats yet again.” On the company’s earnings call, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said production of its Blackwell AI platform “is in full steam” after a design flaw was fixed, and that the company expects to deliver more Blackwells in this quarter than previously estimated. In the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia said it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell chips to customers. “The supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we’re going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year,” Huang said. Nvidia is likely “sold out” of Blackwell until the end of next year, and “has much better visibility in its forecasts than it is letting on,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. “This allows it to offer guidance that it knows it can beat by a small margin, which will help the share price hold onto the massive rally it has enjoyed over the last 18 months,” Windsor said. Nvidia’s shares are up over 198% so far this year. Concerns with Blackwell’s commercial deliveries have not reflected in Nvidia’s earnings reports yet, likely because issues mostly center on data center infrastructure around the chips, and because customers don’t want “to lose their place in the queue” and are therefore buying Blackwell and fixing issues after, Windsor said. Huang addressed a report that Blackwell chips are overheating in custom-designed server racks, saying “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” He also said Nvidia plans “to execute on our annual road map” of producing new chips. Jefferies (JEF+0.71%) analysts said in a note that they “are not overly concerned with any of the issues on this call” and that they “see increasing beats as Blackwell ramps.” But strong demand for Blackwell and Nvidia’s ability to deliver to customers despite production issues might not sustain growth in the long-term. “Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute,” analysts at D.A. Davidson said in a note. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple Stock In 2025: A Prediction On Where It's Price May Head

Time Published: 2024-11-21T17:34:14Z

Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. If someone asked you to tell them the first thing you think of when you hear the word “apple,” your immediate response would probably say a lot about your age and what you have lived through. Maybe it would be a reference to Isaac Newton, who introduced the concept of gravity in the 1600s, and is the subject of a factually inaccurate story about an apple hitting him on the head. Or maybe it would be Apple, the record company famous for its longtime association with the Beatles. But the world-altering company started by a pair of college dropouts, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, in 1976 is likely what “apple” brings to mind first. That is, unless you’re a nutritionist. Apple (AAPL) is now a $3.4 trillion market cap company, whose product line of software and hardware have revolutionized personal communication and business productivity. It is its own ecosphere. But after decades of success, where is its stock price headed? Apple has grown revenue at an 8% rate the past five years, and carries a very manageable debt to equity ratio of less than 2.0. Its dividend yield was briefly high enough for some to consider it a yield stock last decade, but at 0.4% now, that yield only provides decent cash flow to the stock’s largest holders. Apple sells for 37x trailing earnings per share, and 30x next year’s earnings, which are both lofty figures. Through mid-November, the Apple stock was up 17%, well behind the S&P 500’s 24% return and the Nasdaq 100’s 23% gain. The stock is more than 8% of the latter index’s total value and more than 6% of the former’s weighting. So it is clearly a prominent stock, and its price has benefited from the massive inflows to index funds that track those popular market benchmarks.

Cost control is a priority, as is maintaining profit margins and a dominant market share in the areas in which it competes. In recent years, it has expanded its App Store, and its brick and mortar Apple stores have brought it to the people it serves, enhancing an already iconic culture. The iPhone is the leading source of revenue. Apple generated more than $46 billion in revenue from that segment alone during its latest quarter. However, iPads, Mac computers, watches, streaming video and the entire service component are also critical to the company’s continued growth. However, iPhone, now in its 16 version, is a mature business, and perhaps a victim of its own success, as adding updated versions of existing products is less profitable than the next new device or technology. Upgrade cycles contribute more to the company’s bottom line than innovation. That was not always the case. And the company has a new challenge, given its reliance on China, both for production and sales of Apple products. The iPhone is truly the centerpiece of the business, as other products are essentially designed around it. That is especially true of new applications, such as subscription bundles and augmented reality. With $25 billion in service segment revenue in the most recent quarter, this continues to be a driver for Apple. This includes iTunes, digital content, AppleCare, Apple Pay and licensing segments. This is a central part of the company’s future growth, as it provides a second juggernaut business line that makes up for potential cyclicality that has crept into the hardware segment as the company’s products are now so widely owned. Global expansion is an ever-present project for the U.S.-based Apple. The company has helped its own growth in relatively poorer countries by offering installment plan purchases. That has helped it expand in Europe and China, and it now has its sites set on deeper penetration of emerging economies.

As with many market sectors, Apple is likely to be impacted by the dramatic turn of events in Washington D.C. The new administration is determined to reshore manufacturing, and become more inwardly-focused. Apple, as a prominent global manufacturer, is going to have to navigate that situation, and it is way too early to determine how that will work out. This may be where its oligopolistic nature and confirmed industry leadership provides a strong backstop. Based on estimates compiled by Seeking Alpha, Apple is projected to earn $415 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, which ends next September. That implies a price to sales ratio of 8.2, which is not cheap. Earnings are expected to grow to $7.40 a share, which is certainly strong, but also not enough to make the stock inexpensive. As for sentiment, the best way to view that is in the chart pattern (at least, that’s my view after charting stocks for 44 years). On that measure, Apple is again a victim of its own success, but there is a potential silver lining. At around $225 a share, its price has stagnated while younger businesses like Nvidia (NVDA) have rocketed higher, the way Apple’s stock used to do. Apple’s chart is rangebound. However, its price has been trending up steadily, not dramatically, since back in August 2020, when it split its stock price 4-for-1. In 2025 and each successive year beyond that, Apple’s biggest challenge is not staying in business or producing massive revenue. It is too entrenched in too many areas for that to happen. However, being great doesn’t always impress Wall Street, especially when your stock is so richly valued. So what Apple will need to do going forward is to justify its valuation to investors. That is harder to do as a mature business than when it was proverbially taking over the world with its cutting-edge technology and innovation, changing our lives for the better. Over the past 18 months, Apple’s stock price has traded in a range from $165 to $235, and it currently sits near the top of that range. So a sustained breakout through that upper level will be needed for the stock to avoid disappointing investors in the coming year. And with the most recent path to its recent all time highs originating from the $190 area, that will be a key test if the stock breaks down. Apple is far from an upstart, but a cash-rich balance sheet, debt it can manage well, and a “wide moat” via its very devoted customer base all make this a stock that likely has a floor. However, it is a prominent part of the S&P 500, and that means it is always at risk of being caught up in market-wide selloffs. I judge the stock price to be vulnerable at these levels, both chart-wise and due to its hefty valuation. However, if any business can continue its run of being in Wall Street’s good graces, this is it. Post-U.S.-election policy, as well as Apple’s ability to continue expanding its global footprint. And, its success in avoiding disruption of its low-cost production efforts. It is growing, though not at the rate it was, and that growth is likely priced into the stock already. Apple recently scrapped its Project Titan, which aimed to develop a self-driving car to compete with Tesla and others. This ends about a decade of speculation and efforts in this area. Apple will settle instead for applying what it learned from that ill-fated project to other parts of its business, including Apple Carplay. “Safe” and “stock market investing” are two things that simply do not overlap. That is evidenced by the fact that this leading company’s stock has suffered numerous 50% drawdowns in its history, including an 81% peak-to-trough decline. The last big test for the broad stock market was in 2022, when the S&P 500 index fell 18%. Apple stock fell by 26%. So it is far from immune to macro market issues. That said, its strong financial condition is an above-average support mechanism for very long-term investors in the stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter.

The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel.

Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T16:08:27Z

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.06%) shares made a slight recovery at the market open on Thursday, before reversing and continuing its fall during after-hours and pre-market trading. The chipmaker’s shares were down by around 1.2% on Thursday morning but had climbed over 4% at the open. Nvidia’s stock was down by around 1% during pre-market trading on Thursday. Ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday, the chipmaker’s shares were down 0.75% at the market close. Its stock continued falling in after-hours trading — down 3.47% after releasing its fiscal third quarter results, and down 1.2% later in the evening. The company set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, but was expected to set guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet (FDS+1.31%) estimates. Nvidia would need fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion to maintain stock performance on earnings day, according to John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. After it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August, Nvidia’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading due to a lower-than-expected guidance for the fiscal third quarter. The company had set fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above the average analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations for another straight quarter at a record $35.1 billion — almost double its revenue from the same quarter last year. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October are up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. The company reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014.

How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

US stock futures climbed on Thursday, reversing earlier premarket losses as investors dug into Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and lackluster revenue forecast for insights into the prospects for AI-fueled growth. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) led the gains, up 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) added 0.3%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) put on 0.1%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges.

That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chip making. amid questions about the future of the AI boom. Nvidia's shares were down around 1% in premarket trading, recovering from a deeper drop earlier Thursday morning, as investors debated the future of the AI boom. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares edged lower after the DOJ asked a judge to force its Google unit to sell off its Chrome browser. But its antitrust team held off on Android, laying out a choice between divesting the mobile operating system business or adopting stringent remedies. Weekly jobless claims due later Thursday will give the market insight into the labor market as they weigh the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest-rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury Secretary pick, as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed 5% to a fresh all-time high above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the "Trump trade," as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the the pre-market. From top to bottom, Target's results flat out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target could deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN). This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." Below I list out several of the challenges Target is up against. Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the pre-market after earnings last night. Makes sense as Jensen didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high-end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps production of its latest AI chip Blackwell. Usually during ramp periods costs are elevated, and profit margins not at peak levels. Notes Keybanc analyst John Vinh: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Nvidia (NVDA) is retaining its title as the darling of the A.I. revolution—at least for the time being. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker reported record revenue yesterday (Nov. 20) for the July-September quarter that surpassed Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. Demand for Nvidia’s A.I. chips continues soaring, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. “The age of A.I. is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” said Huang during an earnings call. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s quarterly revenue jumped 94 percent to $35 billion while net income more than doubled to $19.3 billion. Before the A.I. boom, Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) were most used by the gaming industry. Today, the company’s data center business, which serves mostly A.I. clients, accounts for nearly 90 percent of its total revenue, bringing in $30.7 billion for the quarter compared with $14.5 billion last year. Gaming revenue, meanwhile, totaled at $3.2 billion. The rest of the company’s sales came from its automotive and professional visualization departments. Huang said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs, which began shipping this month, “is very strong” and production is “in full steam.” In recent months, Nvidia has struggled to meet demand for its Hopper chips. Despite a blowout quarter, Nvidia’s share price slipped nearly 2 percent after the earnings release. Some investors were spooked by the chipmaker’s $37.5 billion revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, which would represent a slowdown in the rapid growth witnessed during past quarters. The “conservative revenue forecast” is “a touch disappointing,” said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at broker XTB, in an investor note. The company’s customer base is also increasingly concentrated. Cloud service providers, which include the likes of Amazon Web Services, accounted for around half of Nvidia’s data center revenue, compared with 45 percent during the same period a year ago. Nvidia’s reliance on this sector “could be a mild cause of concern” going forward, according to Brooks. While some players in the tech industry have also raised concerns that A.I. model improvements are hitting a plateau, Huang remains optimistic about their scaling potential. “Pre-training scaling is intact and its continuing,” said the CEO, adding that test-time compute research has also emerged as an additional and promising method of scaling. “As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.” Nvidia expects the A.I. hype will only continue as society embraces the technology. Besides predicting that machine learning will eventually replace coding, Huang noted that data centers around the world are being modernized into “A.I. factories” that will generate A.I. “just like we’ve generated electricity.” The early foundations of an A.I.-driven world are already evident in developments like the adoption of A.I. agents across workplaces and breakthroughs across physical A.I., said Huang. “We expect this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several more years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Inflation Data Unwinds Some of the Post-Election Rally Stocks soared on 11/6/24 on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration would issue business-friendly policies including relaxed regulations and additional tax cuts. The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date. The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration. October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings. Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices. For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%). There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations. PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point. The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase. Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months. The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18. According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather. In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Re ITW ELAN ELAN, SNOW, BDX, ITW, XEL BIDU GAP

Investing.com - Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, but its current-quarter guidance underwhelmed lofty investor expectations amid red-hot AI demand. The company forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares initially fell roughly 3% in premarket trading Thursday, but rebounded 0.9% into positive territory after the market opened. The company announced Q3 earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.75 on revenue of $33.09B Data center revenue was $30.8B, up 17% from Q2 and up 112% from a year ago. That compared with estimates for $28.84B. Looking ahead to Q4, revenue is expected to be $37.5B, plus or minus 2%, compared with estimates of $37.09B. GAAP gross margins were expected to be 73.0%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Commenting on the print, Bank of America analysts said they "expect [the] stock to churn near-term as investors digest lack of “sizzle” but we continue to like the stock on its “substance”. They note that Nvidia remains the fastest-growing mega-cap company and the undisputed leader in converting $1 trillion of legacy infrastructure to accelerated systems, and continues to generate solid free cash flow (FCF). Separately, Piper Sandler analysts said Nvidia's report, despite missing elevated guidance expectations, sets up the chipmaker "for extremely strong growth starting in April." "The key here is that NVDA is going through a product transition with Blackwell ramping and H200 remaining strong," analysts led by Harsh V. Kumar wrote. "We also continue to believe that starting April, the beat cadence will be quite a bit higher than the $2B cadence NVDA has more or less maintained thus far," they added. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, which some believe represent the next frontier for the company, are expected to face supply constraints amid red-hot demand. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," Nvidia said on Wednesday. Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for Q3, up 17% sequentially and 94% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook of $32.5 billion. Data center revenue reached a record $30.8 billion, with a 17% sequential increase and 112% year-on-year growth, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper and H200 products. NVIDIA's AI enterprise revenue is expected to more than double from last year, with a growing pipeline and annualizing software service and support revenue at $1.5 billion, projected to exceed $2 billion by year-end. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell GPUs, with plans to exceed previous revenue estimates and ramp up supply to meet customer needs. NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased by 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year, supported by strong back-to-school sales and healthy channel inventory. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces supply constraints in gaming, which are expected to impact Q4 revenue despite strong sell-through in Q3. Gross margins are expected to moderate to the low 70s as Blackwell ramps up, with initial configurations potentially impacting profitability. Networking revenue was sequentially down, despite strong year-on-year growth, indicating potential challenges in meeting demand for networking components. The company anticipates competitive market conditions in China due to export controls, which could affect future data center revenue from the region. There are concerns about potential digestion phases in hardware deployment cycles, which could impact growth as the market adjusts to new technologies. Q: Can you discuss the debate around whether scaling for large language models has stalled and how NVIDIA is addressing this? A: Jensen Huang, President and CEO, explained that foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and continuing. NVIDIA is helping customers with post-training scaling and inference time scaling, which are driving demand for their infrastructures. The next generation of models starts with 100,000 Blackwells, indicating strong industry movement. Q: There were reports about heating issues with Blackwell. Can you address concerns about your ability to execute the roadmap with Ultra and Rubin? A: Jensen Huang assured that Blackwell production is in full steam, with more units being delivered than previously estimated. The supply chain is robust, and NVIDIA is on track with its annual roadmap, focusing on performance improvements and reducing AI costs. Q: How is Blackwell expected to ramp this year, and how will it affect gross margins? A: Colette Kress, CFO, stated that Blackwell will ramp with initial gross margins in the low 70s, improving to mid-70s as production scales. Jensen Huang added that Blackwell shipments will increase each quarter, with significant demand driven by shifts in computing from CPUs to GPUs. Q: Could NVIDIA recover to mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? A: Colette Kress confirmed that reaching mid-70s gross margin in the second half of next year is a reasonable assumption, depending on the mix of ramp. Q: Can you provide an update on Sovereign AI demand and explain the supply constraints in gaming? A: Colette Kress noted that Sovereign AI demand remains strong, with growth opportunities in regional clouds and AI factories. Gaming supply constraints are due to fast sell-through and efforts to ramp up supply, expected to improve in the new calendar year.

The offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Nvidia (NVDA) stock opened the year at about $50 per share (on a split-adjusted basis). As of late November 2024, the AI hardware giant stock's price had eclipsed $145 — that growth equates to a year-to-date market value increase of almost 195%. When one of the world's largest companies nearly triples in value over 11 months, investors take notice. You might naturally wonder if Nvidia will keep growing and, if so, whether you can benefit. To help you decide if you should invest in Nvidia, let's review key factors from the company's last earnings release and the questions you should consider before placing a buy order. Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year. Learn more: Track Nvidia’s stock price here Notably, Nvidia generated nearly 88% of its revenue from its data center reporting segment, which includes the company's AI computing solutions. Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense. Remember that you can always add to your Nvidia holdings once you become comfortable with its behavior.

Despite the strong performance, shares dipped more than 2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor caution over valuation and tempered guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $35.08 billion for the quarter ended October 27, a 94% increase year-on-year and beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $33.28 billion. Nvidia’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share came in at $0.81, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.75 EPS. Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform. The tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate. Despite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance. Nvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue. While results underscore Nvidia's dominance in the AI and accelerated computing space, concerns over the company’s soaring valuation and supply constraints for its GPUs could weigh on the stock in the short term. Nvidia will hold a conference call with analysts later Wednesday to provide further insights into its outlook.
