Morgan Stanley (MS, Financial) has raised its price target for Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) from $150 to $160, citing Nvidia's recent bullish performance and anticipated easing of supply-chain challenges. Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Joseph Moore, forecast that Nvidia's new Blackwell product line will significantly boost revenue in the January quarter, with expected sales in the $5-6 billion range. However, these potential gains may face some offset due to ongoing supply constraints, which could affect current quarter guidance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Additionally, Nvidia's product demand trends reveal a shift from the H100 to increased demand for the H200, aligning with Nvidia's recent pattern of raising its sales guidance by approximately $2 billion. Analysts estimate Nvidia's January quarter revenue guidance could surpass consensus at $36.5 billion. Morgan Stanley also predicts an increase in Nvidia's gross margins through FY2026, though initial Blackwell ramp-up margins are expected to be lower. Nvidia's previous gross margin guidance dropped from 75.7% in July to 75.0% in October, a conservative estimate according to Morgan Stanley. Consequently, the firm has raised its FY26 revenue and EPS estimates for Nvidia to $176.78 billion and $4.03, with 73.8% non-GAAP gross margins. While Morgan Stanley considers this earnings period transitional, it maintains Nvidia as a top buy with an Overweight rating, driven by Blackwell's projected impact on late 2025 growth.

Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) hit $85,000 Monday, data from graphing platform TradingView shows, as it extended its rally following Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to hit all-time highs, which shows a strong uptrend. In the past week alone, bitcoin has added almost $20,000 from its Nov. 6 low of $66,700. It was trading recently at $84,255, having climbed as high as $84,989, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has climbed 29% since the election. The interesting part is that the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks are underperforming. Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and META (META) are all down on the day, while Google (GOOGL) is slightly up. Tesla, holding 9,720 BTC, has added 9.6%. Gold is down almost 3%. This could be a rotation from tech stocks and gold into cryptocurrencies as the market awaits Trump's entry into the White House early next year. His campaign emphasized his support for cryptocurrencies. In addition, according to Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw $1 billion in volume in the first 35 minutes of trading. "Day after election it did that in 20minutes, so a bit less than last Wednesday but still pretty intense. Pretty good early indicator of strong inflows this week", according to Balchunas.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday led by a continuation of the 'Trump trade' in the roaring post-election rally rally as investors looked ahead to a fresh reading on inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, up 400 points, or about 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.3%. Both indexes are coming off their best week of the year, capped by record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added about 0.3%. Markets on Veterans Day were building on all-time highs thanks in large part to expectations for lower corporate taxes and deregulation from President-elect Donald Trump. Spirits are also buoyant after the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate cut, though doubts about the rally's staying power are starting to emerge. Wall Street is waiting for October consumer inflation data on Wednesday for pointers to the path of rates. Last week, Chair Jerome Powell stayed mum on the Fed's thinking in the face of Trump policies that could keep price pressures in play. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards One worry is that Trump's proposed tariffs could feed through into higher inflation, prompting the Fed to scale back on rate cuts. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Sunday that if there is an escalating "tit-for-tat" reaction by other countries, policymakers will "have to wait and see". Traders now see a 65% chance that the Fed lowers rates by another quarter percentage point in December, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A week ago, before the presidential election, the odds stood at almost 80%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to top $82,000 for the first time, amid high hopes for a crypto-friendly Trump administration and Congress. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and other smaller digital currencies also gained as traders bet on Trump's promise to make the US a leading light in crypto. In corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares — another "Trump trade" hot spot — continued to climb, up over 8%. The EV maker's stock hit its highest close in over two years on Friday, topping $1 trillion in market value amid optimism over CEO Elon Musk's relationship with the incoming president. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks on Veterans Day opened at all-time highs as market euphoria continued following the presidential elections and the Fed's latest rate cut last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, up roughly 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added about 0.3%. Two of the biggest "Trump trades" to watch on Monday were bitcoin (BTC-US) touching $82,000 to a new all-time high, and Tesla (TSLA) gaining for a fifth straight session. The EV maker's stock topped $1 trillion in market value on Friday. CEO Elon Musk was a major political supporter of Trump, helping him get elected. On Monday, Wedbush analysts raised their price target on Tesla's stock to a Wall Street high, while maintaining an Outperformance rating. "We are raising our price target on Tesla to $400 from $300 as we believe the Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years," Wedbush managing direction Dan Ives wrote in a note. Today, on Veteran's Day, stock markets are open and pointing to further post-election gains, amid big moves in digital assets. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged more than 7% in premarket trading, fueled by optimism over CEO Elon Musk's support for President-elect Donald Trump. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit a new milestone, surpassing $82,000, as Trump’s pro-crypto stance and a Congress with more crypto-friendly lawmakers spark investor enthusiasm.

Title: Sam Altman Has a Side Project Called ‘World’ Aimed at Tackling a World Ruled by A.I.

The past two years have been action-packed for Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. But that hasn’t stopped the A.I. executive from continuing to work on his many side projects, which include Worldcoin, an obscure venture dedicated to human identification. Worldcoin’s primary product is a digital passport storing individual biometric data known as World ID. Last month, Altman announced a slew of updates that will see improvements to various features supporting the venture’s “proof of personhood” mission. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Worldcoin was founded in 2019 and publicly launched last year as a project from Tools for Humanity, a startup established by Altman and Alex Blania, a former deep learning researcher at Caltech. The company’s initial mission was to use digital identification to distribute its own crypto token, WLD, to all humans as a form of a universal basic income, a concept Altman has been interested in for years. In a future where A.I. is ubiquitous, Worldcoin wants to develop tools that will help distinguish humans from bots.”We started thinking about the infrastructure that society was going to need if A.I. really started to happen,” Altman said during a Worldcoin event last month. To that end, Altman and Blania announced at the event that Worldcoin will be rebranded to “World” going forward because the new name better encapsulates the project’s new mission “to accelerate every human.” In order to verify human identities, World uses a product known as ‘the Orb.’ The circular biometric devices scan human eyes to collect unique iris data that becomes part of one’s World ID. The venture chose iris fragments instead of the more traditional fingerprints or face data route because iris biometrics contain more unique details and are less susceptible to external change, it claims. World recently unveiled its next-generation Orb, which is powered by Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jetson chipset and boasts an A.I. performance that is nearly five times better than the previous version. It is also improving accessibility to Orbs, which will be available at flagship locations, self-serve kiosks and can be ordered by individuals through an on-demand service. Updates were additionally announced to World ID, which will now offer enhanced privacy features and the new feature known as Deep Face that will help users identify A.I. deepfakes on video calls like FaceTime, WhatsApp and Zoom. Meanwhile, a new version of the project’s World App—which stores the World ID—will now feature a platform allowing third party apps to run inside the platform. According to Altman and Blania, World is halfway through its four-step roadmap. Having accomplished the development of the Orb and a blockchain network, it is currently working on scaling and will eventually tackle the fourth stage of redistributing the benefits of A.I. “We want to see what happens when we do this at mass scale,” said Altman. While the venture has for years maintained its goal of reaching one billion users by 2023, it currently only has 15 million World ID holders. “It’s great that we’ve signed up so many people, but there’s 99.9 percent left to go,” said the OpenAI CEO.

Title: Terry Smith Shuns Nvidia Shares on Fears AI Hype Is Overblown

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s stock has almost tripled this year, and Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration But, Terry Smith isn’t impressed. The money manager, who’s been dubbed by the UK press as Britain’s Warren Buffett, is skeptical as he says the world’s largest stock lacks a predictable earnings stream and a strong track record of high return on capital. Smith is avoiding the shares even as he acknowledges that such a move undercuts his portfolio’s performance. “I’m not confident that we know what the future of AI is because there are almost no applications people are paying for,” Smith said in a Nov. 5 interview in Tokyo. “Will they be willing to pay on a sufficient scale and a sufficient price to justify this? Because if not, the suppliers of the chips are going to have a problem.” Smith’s caution strikes at one of the biggest concerns about the future of the artificial intelligence industry: will the revenue generated by the technology ultimately justify the billions of dollars of investments the firms have plowed in? The doubts contributed to a selloff which erased about $900 billion from Nvidia’s market value from a June peak to an August low, although the shares have since rebounded. AI enthusiasts note that Nvidia’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., have pledged to pump more into capital spending after splashing a record $59 billion into data center gear and other fixed assets in the third quarter. Strategists expect the company to record a net profit margin of 56% in the 2025 fiscal year as tech firms continue to boost AI spending to keep up with rivals. But, Smith thinks such hefty margins may not last. “Even if AI is the next big thing and we’re going to be paying enough money to justify it, is there just going to be one manufacturer of these chips?” he said. “If you are making fantastic returns, it attracts competition.” “In fact, if you look at the people who are the big users of the microprocessors that Nvidia is supplying, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, they have a history of developing their own,” he added. Smith’s Fundsmith Equity Fund returned 9% this year in dollar terms, trailing the MSCI World Index of developing-market stocks which has gained almost 20%. The underperformance is due to “concentration of performance amongst a handful of stocks,” Smith said, adding that the rising popularity of index funds is fueling this trend. “The popularity of index funds is worrying,” he said. “A lot of people call them passive. But they are not passive. They are momentum strategy. And the momentum will last until it doesn’t.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How a Winning Bet on Crypto Could Transform Brain and Longevity Science A Guide to Trump’s Tariff Plans: Expect High Drama and a Bumpy Rollout ‘I’m Suffering’: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America Retailers Are Considering Electronic Threads to Curb Shoplifting The Crypto World’s Victory Lap Begins ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Trump’s Surprise Boost To Nvidia, AI Stocks

SHANGHAI, CHINA - NOVEMBER 5, 2024 - Visitors watch to learn about Nvidia's AI technology at ... [+] INCLUSION·Conference on the Bund in Shanghai, China,September 5, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Our theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks which includes companies that sell hardware and software for server processors, graphics units, memory, and networking equipment, has returned over 44% year-to-date. This compares to the S&P 500 which remains up by about 25% over the same period. The theme had a solid run, driven by excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence technologies, with accelerated computing chip vendors Nvidia and AMD and other players within the computing ecosystem, including memory manufacturers such as Micron seeing meaningful gains. Tech stocks, including AI names, have also moved a bit higher since the U.S. election results earlier this week. See Playing the U.S. Elections - Stocks To Pick If You Favor Trump. Donald Trump’s win in the 2024 election, along with the possibility of Republicans controlling Congress, could turn out to be a big plus for tech companies pouring money into generative AI. Unlike the Biden administration, which was leaning toward tighter scrutiny of AI development including signing an executive order with new reporting rules for AI companies, Trump’s approach appears to be all about cutting red tape and pushing for deregulation. This could ease compliance-related issues and speed up innovation for technology companies and startups, boosting demand for AI infrastructure components sold by the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Micron. Plus, since AI data centers consume a considerable amount of energy, Trump’s push to expand energy production and ramp up the fossil fuel supply might improve the availability and pricing of electricity, which would be another indirect win for AI projects. In September, the Fed implemented its first interest rate cut in nearly four years, lowering rates by 50 basis points. Yesterday, it carried out another 25 basis point cut. With the benchmark federal funds rate now at 4.50% to 4.75%, there’s still room for further cuts. While the president does not directly influence monetary policy, Donald Trump has a record of being vocal about lowering interest rates to drive economic growth. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to the broader internet infrastructure theme. Why? A softer rate environment would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia, Micron, and AMD. The economics of the AI revolution are still challenged by high model training and inference costs and the payback equation could become just a bit more favorable with declining interest rates. The increase in the Internet Infrastructure theme over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the theme were 45% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could the theme face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a jump? While the structural shift toward greater digitization will drive growth in the theme in the long run, valuations are a bit high, making the risk-to-reward trade-off a bit less attractive for the near term. Within our theme, Nvidia stock has been the strongest performer of late, rising by about 200% over the past 12 months, as demand for graphics processing units surged. On the other side, Cisco stock has been among the weaker performers, returning about 15% over the past 12 months.

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Ken Fisher’s AI Powerhouse with Unmatched Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. Our Methodology This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Total Number of Shares Owned: 93,437,327 Total Value of Shares Owned: $11,543,247,605 Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a powerhouse in GPUs and AI technology, driving advancements across gaming, AI, and autonomous vehicles. The company’s positive outlook is bolstered by its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, where its GPUs are crucial for powering advanced applications, positioning NVIDIA to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI solutions across industries. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center segment is also experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the rise in AI and cloud computing as organizations migrate to these services, placing NVIDIA to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a strong financial foundation, NVIDIA continues to invest heavily in research and development, ensuring it remains at the forefront of innovation. Its robust cash flow further enables strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive accelerated growth. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surpassed estimates, reporting a normalized EPS of $0.68, beating projections by $0.04, with revenue of $30.04 billion, exceeding forecasts by $1.29 billion. As NVIDIA approaches its Q4 earnings report on November 20, 2024, analysts project a normalized EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $32.94 billion. Over the last 90 days, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received 32 upward EPS revisions, reflecting strong investor confidence in its sustained momentum and leadership within the semiconductor industry. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House. McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment. McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.” On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close. Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions. He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta. As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments. To come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. There is no doubt about NVIDIA’s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, On October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures. These blueprints will help the company’s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to release earnings towards the end of this month, on November 20, 2024. In light of its awaited earning release, on October 19, Vivek Arya analyst at Bank of America, joined CNBC to defend his bullish call on NVDA. Having called the stock a “generational opportunity,” Arya emphasizes that NVDA is trading less than one times its earnings growth, much lower than other names in the magnificent seven. He suggests that NVDA celebrates a large ecosystem encompassing “end-to-end” knowledge, placing it ahead of competitors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to our Insider Monkey database. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Inflation and retail sales data greet a roaring stock market rally: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. "We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance," Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. "The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a "flight to quality" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. "In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower," Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. "[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet," Kantrowitz said. "So something we'll be monitoring."

Title: Post-Presidential Election: Stocks, Bonds, And The Fed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/11/09/post-presidential-election-stocks-bonds-and-the-fed/
Time Published: 2024-11-10T00:12:33Z
Full Content:
Despite control of the House of Representatives still being unclear, stock prices and bonds yields ... [+] moved sharply higher in the wake of the Presidential election. The S&P 500 rose by 4.7% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), surged ahead by 8.3%. Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stock Returns While it is now certain that Donald Trump has regained the presidency and the Republicans will control the Senate, enough votes are still being counted to make the fate of the House of Representatives unclear. Betting markets and other sources indicate that the Republicans should retain a slight majority in the House. Either outcome has historically satisfactory outcomes for stock returns. U.S. Government Control: Stock Returns (1933-2023) Stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Focusing on the worst historical return, the decline of 10.2% was after President Obama’s election, with the country mired in recession and a global financial crisis. The results thus far have been better than average, with the S&P 500 rising 3.7% since the election. Politics is not the only factor influencing stocks and is usually not the most critical factor. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. Stock Returns Between Presidential Election and Year-End (1952-2020) According to Strategas, the year after an open presidential election, with the incumbent not running, the returns from stocks have generally been positive if an economic downturn is avoided. Looking at the two negative results, the U.S. economy entered into recession in the fourth quarter of 1969 and the first quarter of 2001. The year 2000 also marked the popping of the internet stock bubble. Stock Returns 1-Year After Open Presidential Elections While the evidence shows that investors should not make macro investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs, it is worth noting the likely policies that could benefit specific companies or industries. President Trump is expected to wield tariffs as a weapon, though China should be his primary target rather than a broad tariff on all countries. Investors should be mindful of China’s exposure to companies in both supply chain and end markets. The Trump administration should be more amenable to mergers and acquisitions than the Biden administration. Regulatory burdens are likely to be reduced, which has already shown up in the performance of bank stocks, which have outperformed the S&P 500 since the election. If the Republicans retain the House, a corporate tax cut becomes more likely. Goldman Sachs estimates that a corporate statutory tax rate reduction to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. Higher-taxed companies, which include more domestically focused companies and small-caps, would benefit more if the corporate tax rate is reduced. Bond yields have been rising since mid-September as the economy has proved more resilient than expected, and increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle will allow the economy to avoid a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked after President Trump’s victory but has since settled down slightly higher than before the results. The behavior of bond yields is analogous to many assets after the election, with a knee-jerk reaction followed by some moderation or stability. U.S. Treasury Yields The silver lining of the increase in yields is that it is due to expectations of better economic growth rather than increasing inflation. Looking at the real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield illustrates that inflation fears are not the culprit for the rise in yields. Rising yields typically act as a headwind for stocks, but better economic growth leads to higher earnings expectations, which can offset the drag. Economic growth expectations rose, reflected in the sharp increase of real yields after Trump’s election, but have since moderated to slightly above the level prior. Real U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield The post-election boost in confidence about economic growth translated to a spike in the outperformance of the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks versus the less sensitive defensives. The outperformance has moderated slightly but remains well above pre-election levels. Small-cap stocks, defined as the Russell 2000, have seen sharp outperformance after the election. The Russell 2000 has risen by 6.2% since the election. Multiple factors have likely driven this small-cap re-awakening. Small-cap stocks are typically more economically sensitive and would be more significant beneficiaries of any corporate tax cut. In addition, many smaller companies are more domestically focused and have less exposure to any tariff trade war with China. Banks, which soared by 8.2% since the election, are likely to benefit from less regulation but also get a tailwind from lower tax rates and better economic growth. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks Within the S&P 500, 102 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With the earnings season nearing completion, the pace of the third-quarter earnings reports slows drastically, with only 11 S&P 500 companies scheduled. S&P 500 Earnings Season Among the companies reporting this week are Home Depot (HD), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Walt Disney (DIS). According to FactSet, the healthcare sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. With the earnings season almost complete, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.3% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, and an improvement over the previous week’s 5.1%. S&P 500 Earnings Season As expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) on Thursday. Markets are pricing in another 25 basis points cut in December, but it is far from a sure thing. Chair Powell’s remarks added little to clarify the situation beyond noting that this was not a time for full-throated forward guidance but that monetary policy is still “restrictive,” which supports better-than-fifty percent odds of a December cut. Incoming economic data will remain crucial to the pace of future rate cuts. On Wednesday, consumer inflation (CPI) will be parsed for signs of a revival in inflation. Friday’s retail sales will give insights into the health of the U.S. consumer and, thus, the economy, but it is likely to be noisy due to the pull forward of purchases due to the port strike and hurricanes. Hurricane damage from Helene and Milton should boost building material sales in this month's report. Number of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stocks and bonds had a knee-jerk reaction to the election, generally followed by some moderation or stability. Fed Chair Powell provided little guidance for the future pace of rate cuts, so this week’s consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales data will be closely watched. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Equities Soar On Trump Election Despite A Slowing Economy

The Dow Jones gained more than 1500 points on Wednesday after Trump won the 270 electoral votes needed to become the 47th President of the United States, and the volume was twice the normal level. By Friday, as shown in the table, all four major indexes closed at all-time record highs. That says something about Wall Street’s view of which candidate’s economic policies were better for long-term economic growth. As of the close of business on Friday (November 8th), for the week, the major indexes are up in the 5%-6% range with the small cap Russell 2000 up more than 8.5%. For that small cap index, the YTD change is just 9%, so almost all of its year-to-date gain came this week! Equity Markets The Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA, GOOG) have also been hot this week with three (NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA) setting new all-time highs, Nvidia and Amazon on Thursday (11/7/24) and Tesla on Friday. Magnificent 7 Prior to the election, markets had been flat. This can be traced to the disappointing guidance from Microsoft and Meta. Apparently, the markets feel confident that President-elect Trump’s economic policies will be positive for U.S. businesses. For example, his stated tariff policy would make it easier for U.S. made goods to compete with foreign imports, especially those from China, many of which are subsidized by the Chinese government. Here is a comparison of some key market and economic data from 2016 (when Trump’s first Presidential term began) to today. Data comparison of Trump's first Presidential term and today Of note, these critical ratios are much more constraining now than they were back in 2016. For example, the debt/GDP ratio of 123% may act as a constraint on Trump’s ambitions. Of concern is the debt servicing cost. If this pierces 30%, the costs of Treasury debt will rise significantly, and there could be more rating agency downgrades. The fact that the Republicans control the Senate and are likely to control the House of Representatives, would, in the past, indicate a more conservative approach to spending and deficits. That hasn’t been the case of late. We’ll see what happens with this Congress. The large fiscal deficits during periods of healthy economic growth has a two-fold negative impact: 1) A rising Debt/GDP ratio has consequences for interest rates (i.e., higher than they otherwise would be) with debt servicing costs set to become a major fiscal headache; 2) A rising Debt/GDP ratio could be a threat to the dollar’s world reserve currency status, a status that keeps demand for dollars and Treasury securities high. A loss of such status would surely raise the cost of U.S. Treasury borrowing. We came across the chart below from the folks at Y-Charts that shows the S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960. For 10 of the 12, the S&P 500 was higher at the end of their terms than at the beginning. Only under Presidents Nixon and G. W. Bush was the S&P 500 lower at the end of their tenure than it was at the beginning. As noted above, the financial markets have high hopes for a second Trump term. S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960 On Thursday (November 7th), the Fed lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) to 4.50%-4.75%, a move that was widely anticipated by the markets. Of interest was Chairman Powell’s response at the press conference to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year inflation rate as calculated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Powell’s response was to refer the audience to the six-month and three-month annualized rates. Both of these are well below the 2% Fed target. That was quite a dovish response. (We note here that in past blogs we have referred to the much lower annualized rates in the three- and six-month indexes; giving us confidence that we would be seeing much lower rates of inflation going forward.) Also of interest was Powell’s comment that “the labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressure,” indicating that there are signs of labor market softening emerging in the data. Again, we have noted such in our past blogs. The surprise of the press conference occurred when Powell was asked if he would step down if asked to do so by President-elect Trump. His response was a short one-word answer with an irritated tone: “NO!” Later in the press conference he indicated that, because the Fed is independent from the Federal Government, under the law, the President could not remove him or any of the other Fed Governors. Note: His term expires in May 2026. We don’t see this as a big deal. This Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle in September, well before the election. Given the duration of business cycles, the Fed isn’t likely to raise rates again during the remainder of Powell’s term. So, the only likely point of disagreement between Powell and Trump can only be the speed at which the Fed lowers those rates. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) showed up at -0.5% in September from their August reading. This is the 7th consecutive negative reading. The Index is down -4.8% from a year earlier, and as shown on the chart, that year/year percentage change hasn’t been positive since mid-2022. The Coincident Economic Indicators still showed up as positive (+1.4%), and while that means that the economy is still growing, the Leading Indicators are forecasting that the future road may be rocky. Here’s some food for thought: In January ’08, LEI was -4.9% year/year (quite similar to today’s -4.8%). The Coincident Indicator was +1.5% (again like today’s +1.4%). What happened next? The Great Recession! Further back, in February ’01, the LEI was -5.0% year/year, and the Coincident was +1.7%. Again, a Recession was not far off. Some economists want to write-off the predictive power of the LEI. We’re not in that camp. Let’s not forget the huge fiscal deficits have played a major role, and are likely the major reason why the economy remains in growth mode. As noted above, a continuation of such deficits endangers the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Leading Economic Indicators The left side of the chart shows the slowdown in Nonresidential Construction. It is rather dramatic with the year/year percentage change falling from more than 20% in 2023 to 5% late in 2024. On the residential side, the growth rate, which peaked in 2021 at over 30%, is now also at a 5% annual rate. While both are still positive, they reinforce our thesis that the economy’s growth rate is slowing. Construction Nonresidential and Residential Spending Since the end of September, interest rates have spiked (see chart). This was likely due to the +2.8% growth in GDP in Q3 and the Street’s expectation that such growth would continue. The labor market appears to be weakening, with payroll growth in the Non-Farm Payroll Survey in October at just +12K (and the Household Survey showed -368K with a falloff of -164K in Full-Time positions). Data shows that consumers spending growth has been far beyond their advancement in income. As Herb Stein famously remarked, “Something that cannot go on forever, won’t!” In the May to September period, income grew +1.1%, but spending grew far faster, at a +3.3% rate. The result has been a rapid drawdown in savings. That cannot continue for long. Consumption growth is likely to slow significantly in 2025 and we think that interest rates will come down by 2 percentage points or more, from a 4.5% Fed Funds rate today to the 2%-2.5% range in 2025-2026. 10 Year Treasury Yield From the rise to record levels in the equity markets this week, it is clear that Wall Street was happy with the results of the presidential election. It is also plausible that had Kamala Harris won, the financial markets could have performed similarly. After all, during President Biden’s term in office, stocks are up 50%. Perhaps the rise in the equity markets was just relief that there was a clear winner and that there won’t be days, weeks, or even months of uncertainty and ballot recounts. Also note that three of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, AMZN, TSLA) also hit record highs this past week (ended November 8th). During President-elect Trump’s first term, the S&P 500 rose +67%. We presented a table that showed a comparison of significant economic indicators Then & Now. Given the much higher starting points in the Now column, especially the P/E ratio and the rising debt/GDP, a repeat of that 67% growth in the S&P 500 achieved in his first term appears to us to be much harder to achieve over the next four years. But, then again, who thought even a week ago that Mr. Trump would be re-elected so handily? Per market expectations, the Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points this past week. The tone of Fed Chair Powell’s press conference was on the dovish side, as the Fed sees inflation continuing to move to its 2% goal and whose attention is now focused on the labor market. Of interest was Powell’s response to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year PCE inflation rate. Powell’s response was that the six-month and three-month annualized rates were much lower. Quite the dovish response. We also now know that Mr. Powell will remain Chairman of the Fed at least through the end of his term (May ’26). Prior to the election, the Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle. That happened in September with the 50-basis point rate reduction. Given the duration of business cycles (measured in years), this Fed is unlikely to raise rates again during Powell’s remaining term. Meanwhile, the Leading Economic Indicators continue to forecast an economic slowdown (at a minimum), while the macroeconomic data coming from the government agencies mostly say that fairly robust economic growth will continue. We are of the belief that an economic slowdown is underway. We just don’t know yet if it will morph into a Recession. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) One Community.

Title: What’s next for nuclear stocks after regulatory pushback?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nuclear energy stocks have become a favorite of Wall Street this year as the artificial intelligence boom spreads and Big Tech searches for ways to meet its growing power demand. They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. "The order may not represent a long-term risk," ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. "It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy." Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.” “It could be as high as 10%, 20%,” Sell added. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk also recently contextualized the amount of power the AI boom is going to require. His data shows that you’d have to add three New York Cities' worth of power to the grid by 2030 to meet the demand that is going to come from artificial intelligence. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Tech companies see nuclear as a way to meet that demand. That may be one reason why Amazon is not done with co-location, telling Yahoo Finance via email that “we remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives.” Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez also rebuffed regulators on his company's earnings call, which came one day after the ruling, saying, "Co-location in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the US to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI." Despite beating on earnings and revenue, Constellation stock (CEG) fell after the company reported third quarter results due to fallout from the Talen news. But CFRA's Rich said Constellation is a stock to watch in nuclear. “I think Constellation is the most buyable dip," he said. "Constellation … is by far and away the largest nuclear operator, more than three times more megawatt capacity than the next competitor. And we think that in our view, nuclear is really one of the best ways to service this type of demand from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, [and Magnificent Seven] names that have large needs for power.” Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks capped their best week of the year on Friday after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly hit 6,000 in a market rally spurred by Donald Trump's White House victory followed by the Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. The broad-based index rose 0.4% to a new record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6% after crossing 44,000 for the first time during the session. Stocks edged higher to end a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. The initial "Trump trade" rush was volatile on Friday as the US dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields gave up a good chunk of their post-election gains. Even so, Wall Street major gauges notched fresh milestones during the session after racking up more records on Thursday as the Federal Reserve delivered the expected interest rate cut. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus drew investor attention, putting pressure on Chinese stocks and oil prices. The $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur a faltering economy. In equities, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) officially entered the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared more than 9%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped more than 10% after Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of his social media platform, Truth Social. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks capped their best week in a year on Friday as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched the 6,000 mark and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed just above the flat line. Friday's gains were a continuation of the monster rally this week spurred by Donald Trump's White House win on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) held above $76,000 ,while Tesla (TSLA) shares rose roughly 8% on Friday to extend gains of 30% for the week. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 15% as Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. After a week of market highs on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win, investors can look forward to more economic data next week for clues on the health of the economy. The next monthly inflation read is scheduled for Wednesday before the market open. Economist expect the Consumer Price Index to have risen 2.6% on an annualized basis in September, with a rise of 0.2% from the prior month. Next week Wall Street will hear from more companies as they announce their quarterly results, including Live Nation (LYV), Spotify (SPOT), Home Depot (HD), and Hertz (HTZ). On Monday, Nov. 11, the stock market will be open but the bond market will be closed in observance of Veterans Day. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed out of negative territory to hit new intraday highs along with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Utilities (XLU) led the market gains along with Real Estate (XLRE) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) as Tesla (TSLA) shares gained more than 9% during the session. Tesla (TSLA) shares rose to a session high of 9% on Friday to hover near $325 each. The EV maker's market cap also climbed above $1 trillion. Tesla stock has soared more than 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory as the company's CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump's biggest supporters. Tesla shares have rallied more than 30% in the past week. Stocks were on track for their best weekly gain this year as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hit the 6,000 mark on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win earlier this week, followed by Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. On Friday the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) wavered between positive and negative territory but if the tech-heavy index manages to close above the flatline, it will notch another record close. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), now a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, briefly touched a new high earlier in the session but later slipped below the flatline. Other notable movers touching all-time highs include the S&P 500's Industrials Sector ETF (XLI) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks. Tesla's (TSLA) market cap rose above $1 trillion on Friday after shares of the EV maker touched 52-week highs. The stock has soared 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday as stocks head toward their best week in a year. The broad market index jumped more than 0.4% to new record highs after a monster rally this week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win. The move higher also follows the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed to new highs on Friday, surpassing the 44,000 level for the first time ever. Chip stocks initially soared on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s win and the Fed’s latest rate cut. But they moved into the red Friday as analysts begin to contemplate uncertainty surrounding Trump’s approach to the chip sector as he returns to the White House in January. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell more than 1%, dragging the Nasdaq (^IXIC). Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 1.1%, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 1.4%, Arm (ARM) sank 3.5% while AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU) fell less than 1%. "Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding. The industry is broadly braced for another round of restrictions on the supply of chips and equipment to China,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts wrote Friday. "Trump's win was clearly the key event this week, and many semiconductor stocks, esp semicaps, are likely to trade sideways till there is clarity on further restrictions, tariffs, and Chips Act funding," Jefferies said. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $76,000 on Friday as the risk-on rally post Donald Trump's White House win was on pace to end the week on a high note. The cryptocurrency spiked to new highs on Wednesday following the presidential election results. Trump was a supporter of bitcoin during his campaign, advocating for the creation of a national crypto stockpile if elected to the White House. Chinese stocks fell on Friday, dragging on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which hovered near the flatline. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus sent shares of Chinese tech stocks lower. The recently announced $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur the economy. E-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 6% while PDD Holdings (PDD) also dropped 6%. Earlier this week the sector fell over concerns of potential tariffs after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Airbnb (ABNB) shares fell nearly 10% Friday after posting mixed third quarter results. Quarterly earnings per share of $2.13 missed Wall Street’s forecast of $2.15, and revenue of $3.73 billion came in ahead of the $3.72 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post maintained his Neutral rating on the stock, raising his near-term estimates for bookings over the next year but lowering his 2025 earnings growth outlook. “While Airbnb is expanding its geographic reach, and has a number of new growth initiatives to help to capitalize on its large bookings ecosystem, core nights growth is in line with peers and the margin growth seems less likely in 2025,” Post said. He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results. US stocks flirted with their record highs on Friday following the latest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average.

US stocks hovered near record highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq lagging as post-election euphoria ebbed and China's latest stimulus plan fell flat. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Stocks drifted higher to end to a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. But the initial "Trump trade" rush appears to be fizzling out as Wall Street questions whether Trump will be able to push through his ambitions policies. The dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields, for instance, have given up many of their post-election gains.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions. Read more here. The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains. "Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs.

For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a return to the Trump rally as investors mapped out the next president's likely impact on markets and awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1%, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.7%. Spirits still appear buoyant after Donald Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. But some on Wall Street see signs of a relief rally, given Trump's decisive victory also put paid to worries about a contested vote. They suggest stock gains could slow as the euphoria fades. The Fed's interest-rate decision later Thursday — typically, a dominant event for markets — is taking something of a back seat amid the election fallout. For one thing, investors see a 25 basis point rate cut as pretty much a sure thing at the end of policymakers' two-day meeting. Instead, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock fell as the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. By contrast, peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares jumped more than 4% after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits in early trading.

Title: Nvidia Stock Prices to Watch as AI Darling Becomes World's Most Valuable Company

Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move. This technique works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that amount to the initial breakout area. In other words, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target of $180. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
