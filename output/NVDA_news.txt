US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions.

"Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning. The previous week's level was revised up by 2,000 from 216,000 to 218,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims came in at 1,892,000, an increase of 39,000 from the previous week's revised level.

US stocks stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a return to the Trump rally as investors mapped out the next president's likely impact on markets and awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1%, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.7%. Spirits still appear buoyant after Donald Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. But some on Wall Street see signs of a relief rally, given Trump's decisive victory also put paid to worries about a contested vote. They suggest stock gains could slow as the euphoria fades. The Fed's interest-rate decision later Thursday — typically, a dominant event for markets — is taking something of a back seat amid the election fallout. For one thing, investors see a 25 basis point rate cut as pretty much a sure thing at the end of policymakers' two-day meeting. Instead, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock fell as the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. By contrast, peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares jumped more than 4% after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates.

Title: Nvidia Stock Prices to Watch as AI Darling Becomes World's Most Valuable Company

Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move. This technique works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that amount to the initial breakout area. In other words, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target of $180. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: Trump's election win could take the U.S.-China chip war to a new level

Since President-elect Donald Trump’s first term in office, the U.S. has wielded its trade restriction and sanctioning powers in an effort to curb China’s technological advances. Now that he’s headed back to the White House, the semiconductor war between the U.S. and China could escalate. “If Trump ascends to the office, he’s already said in his campaign rhetoric that he’s going to double down and even make tariffs as well as export controls more severe,” Arthur Dong, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz in a pre-election interview. Efforts to slow China’s advanced chipmaking abilities under Trump’s first presidential term were continued by the Biden administration. Earlier this year, the Biden administration was reportedly debating using an export control called the foreign direct product rule, which would impact companies in U.S. allies including Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TOELY-1.77%) and Dutch chip machine-maker ASML (ASML-1.47%). The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. It was later reported that some allies would be exempt if the rule is expanded. “He’s [Trump] likely to go further than the Biden administration has gone with regard to the imposition of blanket tariffs across a much wider variety of goods,” Dong said. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. Trump extended the ban on Huawei’s products through 2021, and trade restrictions on it and other Chinese tech firms have only tightened under the Biden administration. Before the election, U.S.-based chip equipment makers were reportedly bracing for more export controls under the Biden administration, telling suppliers they worried about risking their vendor status for using certain components supplied by China. The companies also reportedly told suppliers not to have Chinese investors or shareholders. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” ASML chief executive Christophe Fouquet said in October. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” During his most recent campaign for the presidency, Trump said he would impose tariffs on chips from Taiwan, which could have a heavy impact on global chipmaking, as a majority of the world’s most advanced chips are fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.16%). The Taiwanese-chipmaker counts Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%) and Apple (AAPL+0.09%) as major customers. In October, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry during an appearance on the The Joe Rogan Experience podcast — a point he also made in July during an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In response to a question about supporting Taiwan against Chinese aggression, Trump said the island “took our chip business from us.” “I mean, how stupid are we,” Trump said. “They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy.” Instead, Trump said, Taiwan should be paying the U.S. to protect it. “I don’t think we’re any different from an insurance policy,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Why? Why are we doing this?” During his interview with Rogan, Trump also criticized the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Over a dozen chipmakers, including U.S.-based Intel (INTC+0.02%), Taiwan-based TSMC, and South Korea-based SK Hynix, are still awaiting billions of dollars in funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS Act to build semiconductor hubs throughout the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Super Micro Computer stock bleeds 24% after it can’t even say when it will post actual earnings

Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI-3.48%) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.83% GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

A majority of Big Tech stocks were on the rise Wednesday after former President Donald Trump won his reelection bid against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

Google (GOOGL) parent company Alphabet’s shares were up over 3% after the market open, while Amazon (AMZN) shares were up over 2% — hitting a record intraday high since a peak in July.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Title: What the Latest Dow Shakeup Could Mean

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This week, two new stocks are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above). One way to look at index changes, especially on such a popular index, is as a driver or indicator of sentiment. Stocks added to the blue-chip index could gin up some positive sentiment, while those eliminated might get the stocks off some people’s radars. I could argue the data above supports this interpretation. New stocks in the index underperformed and have been less likely to beat the index than those kicked out of the index. I’m focusing on the data since 2010. Based on the analysis, perhaps wait at least a month then take a look at the two stocks recently eliminated, INTC and SHW. Sign in to access your portfolio

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-3.48%) will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday after market close, following a series of recent challenges. Most recently, the AI hardware company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned over disagreements about Super Micro’s governance practices and board independence. Additionally, Super Micro is facing a potential delisting from the Nasdaq, having received a non-compliance letter in September. The company has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance — or risk being delisted for the second time in five years. Super Micro shares rose 1% to $26.25 on Tuesday afternoon, nearly 80% below their March peak of $123. The company announced a stock split earlier this year that was popular among investors. The company is set to report earnings on Tuesday for the fiscal quarter ending September 2024. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $0.75, up from $0.28 in the same quarter last year. In the previous quarter, Super Micro missed EPS expectations by $0.19, triggering a sharp drop in its share price the following day. Revenues are projected to reach $6.52 billion, representing a 207.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.83%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit following the accusations. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: Nvidia and Apple keep taking turns at the top of the world

Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL+0.09%) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%. Apple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week. Nvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT-0.40%) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February. Nvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. The U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations. In October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML-1.47%) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” The U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.

Title: University A.I. Programs See Massive Enrollment Surges Thanks to ChatGPT

Time Published: 2024-11-05T13:00:58Z

In 2018, the University at Buffalo became one of the first schools in the world to establish a master’s program focused on A.I. The technology “wasn’t a big craze” at the time, Kemper Lewis, dean of the university’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, told Observer, with the program’s enrollment seen as “slow and steady for a little while.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The program is classified as a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on A.I. and provides a foundational background in A.I. and relevant subsets like machine learning, deep learning and advanced artificial neural networks. The degree opened for enrollment in the spring of 2020 and counted five students in its inaugural semester. That number has since risen more than twentyfold, with the university counting 103 students in the program this fall. “It was a great investment now that we look back on it,” said Lewis. A portion of this surge can be attributed to the mainstream breakthrough of A.I. following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said Lewis, who noted a “decent jump” in enrollment in connection to the chatbot’s release. But the program’s more significant surges occurred in relation to local initiatives like Empire A.I., a $400 million statewide research consortium unveiled by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year. The University at Buffalo is part of the new public-private research center and plans to build an A.I. supercomputing center on campus valued at $250 million. “I think there’s a lot of Google searches going on right now about A.I. degrees, Buffalo, and they’re finding our master’s program from all over the world,” said Lewis. The University at Buffalo isn’t the only school embracing A.I. into its degree programs. Schools like Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University and MIT were also early adopters, while the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year made history as the first Ivy League school to offer an undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s in A.I. Carnegie Mellon, which established its A.I. undergraduate degree in 2018, has also seen a rise in interest. While its 2019 enrollment totaled 53, the program has reliably counted more than 100 students annually since 2021. Oregon State University’s graduate A.I. program grew from 15 students in its inaugural 2021 class to 62 last fall, and MIT’s A.I.-related undergraduate major counted 300 students this year compared to just 37 in 2022. A.I.-related undergraduate and master’s degree conferrals have risen by 120 percent since 2011, according to a 2023 report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, while A.I.-related Ph.D. conferrals have increased by 33 percent during that time. At the University at Buffalo, the school’s A.I. degree takes between 12 to 18 months to complete and has sent off alumni to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. The school is in the process of bolstering the program through initiatives like Advancing Top 25: Faculty Hiring, which has helped add more than 200 faculty members researching A.I. Such research is needed as the program’s subject matter continues to shift, according to Lewis. “We’re constantly working on improving the degree and making sure it continues to be relevant,” he said. Lewis added that its efforts are starting to pay off as people grasp the relevance of A.I. and begin perceiving it as a valuable sector in higher education. “I think students around the world are starting to realize, okay, this is here to stay,” he said.

US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets.

The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected.

Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. "Trump trades" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. "Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023," Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees "tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a "bitcoin national stockpile" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Read more here. Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output. Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — "a bit above typical" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: "The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible." Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. "Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC "erred" in its ruling, adding the company is "evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions." Talen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Perplexity, an AI search company, wants you to use artificial intelligence to track election results. The company launched its Election Information Hub on Friday to offer AI-generated answers to questions you have about elections. The hub provides summaries of candidates and their policies — with somewhat vague descriptions — and offers information about local ballot initiatives. “People deserve a clear, easy way to find the information they seek, and few topics are as consequential as elections,” the company said in a statement. “We want to do our part to support an informed electorate, so we’ve built the election hub on Perplexity’s answer engine: an entry point for understanding key issues, voting intelligently, and tracking election results.” The company told The Verge it’s partnering with the Associated Press and Democracy Works to gather its data, and Perplexity cites Wikipedia in many of its entries. “We selected domains that are non-partisan and fact-checked, including Ballotpedia and news organizations. We’re actively monitoring our systems to ensure that we continue to prioritize these sources when answering election-related queries,” Perplexity’s spokesperson said. The company, which has backing from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%), has previously been accused in a WIRED investigation of: making things up, often inaccurately summarizing topics, and even attributing fake quotes to real people. WIRED dubbed the site a “bullshit machine.” But Perplexity believes its election hub will not have similar problems. “We want to make it as simple as possible to receive trusted, easy-to-understand information to inform your voting decisions,” the company said. “For each response, you can view the sources that informed an answer, allowing you to dive deeper and verify referenced materials.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 200 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility. By afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 203 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.16% and 0.10%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR+2.76%) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%) shares rose over 1% on Monday as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+0.02%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.66%) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL+0.09%) and Bank of America (BAC+0.68%), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: A Nvidia partner's stock surged because Nvidia wants chips faster

An Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%) partner in South Korea saw its shares surge Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker wants chips faster. SK Hynix’s South Korea–listed shares closed up almost 6.5% after SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won told reporters that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the company to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. Chey, speaking at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, added that Nvidia is still struggling to fulfill chip demand but that the two are working together on the shortage, Bloomberg reported. Huang requested that SK Hynix provide samples of its HBM4 chips earlier than expected, Chey said. In October, SK Hynix said it expected to supply customers with the new HBM chip, which Nvidia needs for its artificial intelligence chips, by the second half of 2025. Chey said both Nvidia and SK Hynix “are on the same page” about HBM4’s schedule, according to Bloomberg. The South Korea-based chipmaker’s shares are up 37.1% so far this year. The company also unveiled a 16-layer HBM3E at the summit that it said will be with customers early next year. SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said the company will release the next-generation HBM5 and HBM5E sometime between 2028 and 2030. In October, SK Hynix reported record revenue, operating profit, and net profit, “achieving best-ever quarterly performance” in the third quarter on demand for its memory chips for AI technology. “SK Hynix has solidified its position as the world’s No.1 AI memory company by achieving the highest business performance ever in the third quarter of this year,” Kim Woohyun, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said in a statement. “We will continue to maximize profitability while securing stable revenues by taking flexible product and supply strategies in line with market demand.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia (NVDA-0.75%) shares rose 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+0.02%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Nvidia, often hailed as an “AI darling,” has seen substantial gains throughout the year, driven by its advancements in AI chip technology. The company’s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming year, bolstered by expanding interest and investment in artificial intelligence — a field where Nvidia remains a clear leader. Nvidia’s in-demand Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s most advanced generative AI models, have propelled the company to record-high quarterly results and a $3 trillion valuation. The chipmaker’s next-generation Blackwell AI chip platform was launched in March and has seen a large surge in demand. The stock split Nvidia announced earlier this year also boosted popularity and growth. The company’s share price has surged by 173% so far this year — and by 193% in the past year. In the past five years, the stock has seen an astronomical 2,498% rise. In contrast, Intel has lagged in the AI boom and missed key opportunities. For example, Intel decided to pass on investing in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, which has since revolutionized AI applications and reached a valuation of around $80 billion. Intel’s stock has suffered, dropping over 53% this year alone, highlighting the challenges the company faces as it tries to catch up with more agile competitors such as Nvidia.

Title: NVIDIA Starts Diverting Orders Away From Super Micro Computer (SMCI) As A Potential Delisting And DOJ Investigation Loom Large

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is NVIDIA's third-largest customer. Additionally, in what is a testament to the heretofore symbiotic relationship between these two entities, SMCI's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. Now, however, it appears that NVIDIA has had enough of Super Micro Computer's near-constant headaches, and is deliberately trying to create some much-needed distance. *NVIDIA HAS BEGUN REDIRECTING ORDERS FROM SUPER MICRO COMPUTER TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS $NVDA $SMCI $DELL $HPE — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) November 4, 2024 To wit, Digi Times is reporting today that NVIDIA has begun redirecting its orders that were originally placed with Super Micro Computer to other suppliers. This development comes as SMCI is now contending with allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, the exodus of its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Super Micro Computer's travails began in August when Hindenburg Research detailed instances of alleged accounting fraud and corporate governance malfeasance in a detailed report. SMCI then delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, presumably in a bid to undertake an internal review. Do note that under the prevailing statutory requirements, SMCI's annual report had to be filed by the 30th of August. Meanwhile, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. As per Hindenburg Research's anecdotes, Super Micro Computer engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. Finally, do note that the Nasdaq exchange recently warned Super Micro Computer of a potential de-listing action should it fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. That punitive action could come as soon as the 20th of November. Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post earlier today, Super Micro Computer has negotiated major changes to its loan agreement with Cathay Bank, with the firm now required to furnish audited financial statements by the 31st of December as opposed to the earlier covenant, which posited the 28th of October as the deadline for furnishing these financial documents.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Home » Artificial intelligence » Nvidia Might Invest in xAI at a $75 Billion Valuation The New York Post reports NVDA is looking to make a strategic investment in Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI. xAI is exploring a new funding round in January 2025, which could value the company at $75 billion. xAI last raised a $6 billion round with a $24 billion valuation earlier 2024. xAI is doubling the size of its 100,000 H100 chip AI data center now. This could be installed and running in a month. xAI will be getting 300,000 Nvidia B200s. B200s are the next generation Nvidia chips with 20 Petaflops of performance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described xAI installing 100,000 H100s in 19 days as superhuman. Brian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

As an investor, how do you know what portions of robotaxi value will be owned by Tesla and what will be owned by xAI? How do you know that Musk won’t make the AI driver an xAI asset and license it to Tesla? How can you be sure enough in future AI driver ownership to make Tesla worth investing in? Well you need to try to get into a secondary share offering with brokers such as Aption, Nasdaq Private Markets, Linqro, Ameetee etc. There were multiple offerings over the last month at $29 Billion and now $40-45Billion. If that doesnt work stay long Tesla forever and same when SpaceX will go public and of course .xai will eventually go public as well. It doesnt matter which entity is making money in the greater Musk ecosystems. .Xai will become quite obviously the mainframe system the other organizations will pull from. And will for sure license it for profit to 3rd parties as Musk is really good with his track record to turn things into big revenue streams, I would imagine that Peter Thiels Palantir will be one of the first and biggest 3rd party customers of .Xai. Just look up the revenue growth online for Starlink internet at SpaceX. Its mind blowing what they have pulled off. Comments are closed.

Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.
