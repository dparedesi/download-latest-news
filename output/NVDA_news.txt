Nvidia has posted a record quarterly revenue, which has helped dampen fears of an AI bubble and lift crypto and tech stocks. Tech and crypto stocks rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday after chip maker Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations on the top and bottom line, allaying fears of an AI bubble. Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter ended Oct. 26, up 62% from a year ago and beating Wall Street projections of $54.7 billion. The company reported a profit of $31.9 billion, a 65% increase from last year and surpassing analyst expectations. It also gave a higher-than-expected guidance of $65 billion in revenue for its fourth quarter, suggesting the appetite for artificial intelligence isn’t yet slowing down. Concerns of an AI bubble had seen tech shares slide over the past weeks, which saw crypto also dump as investors sold off risky assets, and the broader market was awaiting Nvidia’s earnings as a health check on the AI-heavy tech sector. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) jumped over 5% in after-hours trading on its Q3 earnings to $196 after closing trading on Wednesday up 2.85% to $186.52. The chip maker’s earnings beat helped lift shares across crypto companies after-hours, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) all seeing slight bumps after finishing the trading session down. Crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) was also lifted by 1% in post-trading after finishing the day down 3.7% despite beating Wall Street’s predictions and reporting its strongest quarter since going public in August. Related: 21shares Solana ETF launches amid crash, but flows signal investor interest Big Tech stocks were also up, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) all seeing gains after the bell. Nvidia’s earnings have also helped to buoy Bitcoin (BTC), which has dropped over 10% in the past week amid a wider market rout. Bitcoin fell to a 24-hour low of $88,540 in late trading on Wednesday, dipping below $89,000 for the first time since late April. It has since seen a recovery to around $91,500, coinciding with Nvidia’s earnings announcement and is down 0.6% over the past day, per CoinGecko. Ether (ETH) has also seen a recovery after sinking to around $2,873 on Wednesday, its first time under $2,900 since mid-July. It has climbed back above $3,000 and is down 1.9% on the day.

Fears of an AI bubble took at least a temporary breather after Nvidia (NVDA) reported an earnings beat as well as a strong fourth quarter outlook after the close of U.S. markets on Wednesday. The chipmaker topped Wall Street’s expectations for the third quarter, reporting revenue of $57.01 billion — a 62% jump from a year earlier — as the AI investment boom continues to fuel demand for its chips. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," said CEO Jensen Huang. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially." Shares of the company were higher by 4% in after hours trading at press time. Data center revenue — arguably the biggest source of income for the firm — landed at $51.2 billion — slightly above analyst forecasts of $49.34 billion. As for the all-important outlook, NVDA sees fourth quarter revenue of $63.7-$66.3 billion against Street estimates for just $62 billion. The news for the moment has calmed particularly jittery crypto markets, sending bitcoin BTC$82,630.98 back above $90,000 after having nearly fallen through $88,000 earlier Wednesday. AI-focused crypto tokens like TAO$280.27, Near Protocol NEAR$1.9292, ICP$4.3192 and RNDR$1.7707 all rose 4%-5% following the report. Also on the move are those bitcoin mining stocks that have pivoted to AI infrastructure. These names have been on big runs higher this year, but brutally battered of late on the general tech/crypto selloff combined with fears of an AI bubble. Among the gainers Wednesday evening: IREN (IREN) up 8%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) up 11% and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) up 6%. The results reinforce Nvidia’s position at the center of the artificial intelligence supply chain. Its GPUs are critical for training large language models, powering data centers, and running machine-learning workloads across big tech companies. The firm will hold a conference call at 5pm E.T. as investors are looking for reassurance that the company’s massive bets on AI infrastructure, software tools and next-generation chips are translating into lasting revenue.

Title: Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble. Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations. “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown. The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The world’s most valuable public company has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders stand to be impacted by Wednesday’s results. Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks. Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market. “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report. At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a $100 billion investment in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back. But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday committed to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants. Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google all indicated in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also laid out at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars. Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Nvidia Climbs Ahead of Earnings; GE Vernova Powers Higher

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Wednesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising 2.9% to lead chip stocks higher ahead of the AI darling's highly anticipated quarterly results after the bell. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.6%. See here for Investopedia's full daily market summary. Shares of GE Vernova (GEV), the energy technology company spun off from GE in April 2024, surged 7.3% after the company announced its first wind repower upgrade agreement outside the U.S. Under the deal, GE Vernova will provide 25 wind repower upgrade kits, used to modernize and extend the operational life of aging wind turbines, to Taiwan Power Company. Constellation Energy (CEG) shares jumped 5.3% after the Department of Energy said it had provided a $1 billion loan to fund the utility company's plan to restart a decommissioned nuclear reactor at the Pennsylvania site formerly known as Three Mile Island. Constellation entered a deal last year with Microsoft (MSFT) to resume operations at the nuclear facility to help power the software giant's energy-intensive data centers. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) reported better-than-expected adjusted profit for the third quarter, and shares of the home improvement retailer climbed 4%. The company highlighted an increase in online sales, strength in its business with professional contractors, and growth in "home services," a program that connects customers with licensed professionals for help with installation and remodeling projects. The strong report from Lowe's came a day after rival Home Depot (HD) missed quarterly earnings forecasts and cut its outlook, citing headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the housing market. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) gained 2.8% to close at an all-time high after the tech giant launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model. Several analysts praised the newest version, saying it competes with state-of-the-art models from competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. Wednesday's move into record territory followed gains earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed a stake in Alphabet. Eversource Energy (ES) stock dropped 12.5%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500, after regulators in Connecticut rejected the utility company's proposed sale of its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. The state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to block the transaction, determining that it failed to meet the proper standards for managerial sustainability. A pair of agricultural giants came under pressure following reports that the Trump administration may delay proposed cuts to incentives for biofuel imports. Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Bunge (BG), which process commodities like corn and soybeans into biofuel, slipped 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.

November 19, 2025 16:20 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the third quarter ended October 26, 2025, of $57.0 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and up 62% from a year ago. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 73.4% and 73.6%, respectively. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were both $1.30. “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.” During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $37.0 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, the company had $62.2 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 26, 2025, to all shareholders of record on December 4, 2025.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

Some "smart money" has been seeing signs of rain—and reaching for the umbrella. Robinhood (HOOD), the company behind the popular retail trading app, last week added to its allocation to T-bills, the short-term Treasury notes considered some of the safest investments around, "to protect some capital," CIO Stephanie Guild said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. "I felt like the market was giving you signs that it was going to sell off a bit," Guild said. As the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, spiked and broad market benchmarks reflected investor jitters, some pros were making moves to shore up their portfolios. Meanwhile, retail investors have started to tiptoe back into some of this year's high-flyers after they took a dip. Institutional investors are sometimes referred to as "smart money"—and the general public "dumb money"—because the former tends to be a step ahead on market pivots. Robinhood's robo-advisor has lately turned more defensive, potentially a caution signal worth heeding. Robinhood Strategies, the March-launched robo-advisor with over $1 billion in assets, added to its healthcare investments in October, according to Guild, and slimmed its holdings in technology. She said investors were right to start questioning the valuations of stocks ginned up on the AI-rally, and that while she believes in the possible benefits of the technology, one has to reckon with the short-term question of how much it'll cost to develop. The company's managed portfolios are also invested in rare earth stocks and industrial defense companies. a nod to the Trump administration's policies. "The Fed matters less than it used to," she said. "I think the President and [the administration's] actions matter a little bit more." The Robinhood CIO also characterized the recent dip as "kinda normal," and observed that retail investors were wading back into the names that had rallied hard and more recently were "hurt the most"—stocks like CoreWeave (CRWV), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META).

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday Wednesday ahead of highly anticipated earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) due after the closing bell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow fell. Shares of the AI chipmaker climbed ahead of what is being widely viewed as the biggest event of this earnings season. Lowe's (LOW) stock surged after the home improvement retailer reported a better quarterly profit than analysts had expected. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares continued their winning streak that began Monday when Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed a stake in the owner of Google and YouTube. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) climbed after the power company received approval for an up to $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. Eversource Energy (ES) shares tumbled after a Connecticut regulator blocked the utility’s plan to sell its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. Shares of Plug Power (PLUG) sank after the maker of hydrogen fuel cells said it would sell $375 million in notes that investors could convert into the firm’s stock. Shares of Valero Energy (VLO), APA (APA), and others in the energy sector declined along with the price of crude, which slid amid concerns about oversupply. Gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded in the red.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s recent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The stock market rally — ﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years. Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue. Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a sell-off in AI stocks over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year. “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN. Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks. “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.” Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price. As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about circular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals. Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive. “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert, CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.” And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy. At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany. Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave. “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

Title: Nvidia’s Earnings Report Arrives Tonight and Its Stock Is Rising Ahead of the News

Nvidia shares are showing signs of life on a critical day for financial markets. The stock was up 2% recently ahead of the release of Nvidia's (NVDA) quarterly results after the closing bell, the most highly anticipated event of the earnings reporting season. Coming into today's session, the stock had lost nearly 15% of its value since hitting a record high in late October. But it's still up nearly 40% for the year, roughly three times the gain of the S&P 500 and trailing only Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) in the Magnificent 7. Hyperbolizing about the importance of Nvidia's quarterly results has become a bit of investor vogue lately. Will they determine the future of the company—currently the world's most-valuable—all humanity, or just the AI trade? Whatever the case, the numbers will be closely watched and the insta-analysis plentiful. There aren't many stocks out there that capture broader attention in the way Nvidia does. That's not just because it's been a powerful gainer, but also because of its substantial weight in the benchmark S&P 500, which means its moves affect the legions whose holdings lean toward low-cost passive investments. Stocks, and particularly tech stocks, have been under pressure lately, as investors have begun to look for cracks in the argument for ever-higher investment in AI technology and offered up some skepticism about the arguably circular nature of investment in the industry. "I think people are really gonna need (CEO Jensen Huang) to explain this circular deal mentality, because I don't think it's stopping anytime soon," said Ben Reitzes, Head of Tech Research at Melius Research, in an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning. Reitzes said investors will want to hear more from Huang on his methodology, the kinds of return on investment Nvidia expects and what he sees in AI usage that gives him confidence investments are good ones. Futures markets indicate that Nvidia's shares could move dramatically in the days after its report, which—in the near term, at least—could determine the path ahead for stocks. LPL Financial on Wednesday said traders anticipate a move of near 7% in either direction, which would represent its biggest reaction since the fourth quarter of last year. Some investors have already moved away from the high-powered stock in various forms, making notable portfolio changes before Nvidia's numbers landed. Softbank recently sold its Nvidia stake, though it said the move was intended to fund investments in OpenAI; Peter Thiel's hedge fund also sold. Today, stock investors are seeing some green in their screens after several days of red. The S&P 500, which has lost ground the past four sessions, was up slightly recently. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also ticked higher, while the SOX index of semiconductor stocks gained more than 1%. (Here's our live coverage of today's trading.) The winter is generally seen as an upbeat season for markets, but a disappointing report or outlook from Nvidia could mean this year is different.

Nvidia’s quarterly results are almost here, and anxiety is running high. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's Fear Index, on Tuesday ended the day just below 25, near its highest level since May, when the market was cooling off from April’s tariff tantrum. The index has risen substantially in the past week after coasting along in the mid-teens throughout the second half of the year. (It was recently a bit below 24; a reading below 20 is generally considered calm.) And CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks seven stock-market metrics to gauge the mood on Wall Street, yesterday fell to its lowest level since mid-April. Six of the seven index inputs were flashing “Extreme Fear” on Wednesday morning, with measures of momentum and market breadth having slumped in recent weeks. Wall Street's mood can have as much of an impact on short-term stock performance as the health of the economy or developments with a specific business. Today investors are largely concerned with the quarterly earnings from Nvidia, due after the bell, which could substantially inform how people feel about stocks going forward. Recent anxiety has centered on AI, with some investors worrying that tech giants are overspending on technology with uncertain commercial prospects. Others argue AI will transform nearly every industry, justifying tech’s massive investments and high stock valuations. The AI bubble debate has been playing out for some time, but it intensified this month. Forty-five percent of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America in November said an AI bubble was the biggest tail risk facing the market, up from 33% last month and just over 10% in September. More than half of those surveyed said AI was already in a bubble. And bullish sentiment among retail investors last week fell to its lowest level since early September, according to the Association of American Individual Investors. Bearish sentiment jumped nearly 13 percentage points, the biggest week-over-week increase since February. The stock market faces a critical test this afternoon when Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings. The AI chip giant's quarterly report has become a must-watch event on Wall Street this year, with its results often treated as a proxy for AI demand and a major driver of the AI rally. AI bubble concerns and some high-profile divestments have dragged down Nvidia's stock this month, but expectations are still high. Analysts predict the huge amounts of capital tech companies are pouring into data centers will underpin another strong quarter for the chipmaker.

Nvidia stock is in focus as November 19 approaches. Investors are watching for Q3 results with expected $54 billion revenue and $1.25 EPS. Michael Burry has reignited market tension with fresh warnings about an AI bubble, huge bearish bets and a cryptic Nov. 25 reveal. Scion’s Q3 filing showed $187.6 million in Nvidia put options and $912 million in Palantir puts. Burry later confirmed owning 50,000 Palantir put contracts at a $50 strike and 10,000 Nvidia puts at $110, signaling major downside wagers.

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood."

He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return.

High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia."

It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

"We believe consensus long-term projections remain reasonable, while NVDA's valuation at about 22x CY 27 basis is enticing given growth prospects and management's blue sky TAM vision of $3T-$4T by decade's end," stated equity analyst Angelo Zino. CFRA reiterates its strong buy rating for Nvidia and maintains its bullish $270 price target. DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

Analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a buy rating and updated the bank's per-share estimates for the coming fiscal year to $4.56, $7.02, and $9.15 per share. While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

November 19, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary NEW YORK, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into solar design platforms is accelerating as companies work to automate and enhance the solar project lifecycle. With AI, design platforms can instantly analyze satellite imagery, shading, roof geometry, and energy consumption patterns to create highly customized system proposals. This integration reduces the time needed for manual surveys and engineering work, making project initiation much faster. It improves accuracy, helping installers minimize errors in system sizing, equipment selection, and installation planning. Companies adopting AI-driven design tools are positioning themselves to handle higher project volumes with fewer resources. A report from Grand View Research said that the global solar AI market size was estimated at USD 5.96 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 18.43 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 20.8% from 2025 to 2030. The report had key Market Trends & Insights: “North America solar AI market dominated the global industry and accounted for a 36.8% share in 2024; Based on technology, the machine learning segment dominated the industry and held a 49.9% share in 2024; Based on application, the Smart Grid Management segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; Based on end use, the industrial segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; North America: Largest market in 2024; Asia Pacific: Fastest growing market.” A.I. Companies active in the markets this week include: PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). The Grand View Research report continued: “AI models are significantly transforming the solar energy industry by improving forecasting accuracy, which is crucial for optimizing energy production and consumption. By integrating real-time weather data with historical energy trends, these models provide more precise predictions about solar energy generation. This enhanced forecasting allows grid operators to better manage the distribution and storage of energy, ensuring that supply meets demand efficiently. As solar energy is intermittent, having accurate predictions helps prevent imbalances and reduces the risk of grid instability or blackouts. AI-driven solutions also enable more effective use of energy storage systems, ensuring that excess energy produced during peak sunlight hours is stored and used during low-generation periods. The integration of solar energy, battery storage, and artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming important in the renewable energy market, especially for grid decarbonization… AI models help optimize when and how energy should be stored or distributed, ensuring a consistent flow of carbon-free power, even during non-peak production hours. With growing investments in energy storage and AI capabilities, the solar sector is evolving into a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable energy market. This trend signifies a shift toward more advanced grid integration technologies that will drive the next wave of clean energy innovation.” PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) and Smartlink AI (“Orbit AI”) to Launch the First “Orbital Cloud” for AI Infrastructure into Space PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (“PowerBank” or the “Company"), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is collaborating with Orbit AI in the launch of a revolutionary space initiative known as the Orbital Cloud — where communications, compute, and verification converge in LEO powered by Solar energy. The mission leverages cutting-edge satellite technology, high-performance AI compute hardware, blockchain verification systems, and clean-energy solutions to demonstrate a next-generation digital infrastructure in orbit. Strategic Vision - Orbit AI is developing DeStarlink, the first decentralized low-Earth-orbit network for global connectivity, and DeStarAI, a suite of orbital AI data centers powered by solar arrays and naturally cooled in space. Together, these systems form the Orbital Cloud, a unified infrastructure layer designed to enable sovereign, censorship-resistant connectivity and in-orbit compute services. Through its collaboration with Orbit AI, PowerBank intends to contribute advanced solar energy systems and adaptive thermal control solutions, reflecting its broader shift toward digital asset, data center, and RWA (Real World Asset) infrastructure, where solar power supports digital infrastructure deployments and high-growth AI markets. PowerBank’s contribution focuses on solar power and adaptive thermal technologies essential to future satellite’s “Execution Layer.” “The next frontier of human innovation isn’t just in space exploration, it’s in building the infrastructure of tomorrow above the Earth,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank. “The combined markets for orbital satellites, in-orbit data centers, blockchain verification, and solar-powered digital infrastructure are projected to exceed $700 billion over the next decade. By integrating solar energy with orbital computing, PowerBank is helping create a globally sovereign, AI-enabled digital layer in space, which is a system that can help power finance, communications, and critical infrastructure.” “Orbit AI is creating the first truly intelligent layer in orbit — satellites that compute, verify, and optimize themselves autonomously,” said Gus Liu, Co-Founder and CEO of Smartlink AI. “The Orbital Cloud turns space into a platform for AI, blockchain, and global connectivity. By leveraging solar-powered compute payloads and decentralized verification nodes, we are opening an entirely new potentially $700+ billion-dollar market opportunity — one that combines energy, data, and sovereignty to reshape industries from finance to government and Web3. PowerBank’s expertise in advanced solar energy systems will be significant in supporting this initiative.” As Jeff Bezos recently commented at Italian Tech Week, Turin, Italy, October 2025[1]: “We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centres in space in the next couple of decades. These giant training clusters will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7 — no clouds, no rain, no weather. It already has happened with weather and communication satellites. The next step is going to be data centres and then other kinds of manufacturing.” CONTINUED… Read this and more news for PowerBank Corporation at: https://powerbankcorp.com/news/ In other recent developments and happenings in the Artificial Intelligence market include: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stepped back into the U.S. bond market for the first time since 2022, raising $15 billion as it continues pouring money into AI infrastructure. The company issued the debt in six parts, according to an SEC filing, giving itself extra room to fund acquisitions, boost working capital, pay down existing debt and, if needed, support stock buybacks. Demand for the deal was huge right out of the gate. People familiar with the sale told Bloomberg that orders climbed close to $80 billion before easing once borrowing costs improved during the process. Even with the cooldown, the enthusiasm shows how willing investors are to back Big Tech's AI ambitions. It isn't just Amazon: Alphabet recently sold $25 billion across the U.S. and Europe, Meta raised $30 billion in October and Oracle secured $18 billion earlier this year. China approved the first foreign automaker generative-AI services this week, clearing Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) to offer in-car AI assistants to Chinese drivers. Regulators in Shanghai registered Tesla's xBot customer-service model, while Beijing's cyberspace authority listed Mercedes-Benz's virtual assistant. The approvals let both firms deploy voice assistants that handle customer queries, navigation and media controls after meeting local cybersecurity, data-localization and content-safety requirements. Volvo's cockpit assistant also secured registration in Shanghai, showing regulators will accept foreign models that localize operations. Marking a new era of industrial innovation, SymphonyAI, a global leader in Vertical AI product platforms, announced a milestone integration of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Omniverse™ libraries into its IRIS Foundry DataOps platform and IRIS Forge application builder, running on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure cloud and edge infrastructure. Unlike static digital-twin tools, this integration brings live industrial data into 3D digital twins developed using Omniverse libraries, enabling teams to simulate entire plants or production lines in minutes instead of weeks—reducing the time to insight and accelerating operational improvements. Unveiled at Microsoft Ignite, this integration brings together transformative 3D modeling, real-time simulation, and enterprise-grade AI to accelerate digital transformation for refineries, manufacturers, energy producers, and process industry leaders worldwide. As industrial organizations increasingly move from AI pilots to full-scale production, they face complex challenges: how to visualize and optimize diverse, distributed operations in real time; how to break down data silos across sites and assets; and how to empower teams with actionable insight for better, faster decisions. This solution—integrating NVIDIA Omniverse libraries into IRIS Foundry, running in Microsoft Azure—enables users to build dynamic applications within minutes using IRIS Forge. These applications support collaborative simulations, 3D visualizations, and interactive modelling, while enhancing operational intelligence and allowing one-click deployment to the Azure cloud. Built on Microsoft Azure’s cloud and edge infrastructure, the integration uses Azure Kubernetes Service for orchestration, Azure Entra ID for secure access, Azure Edge Runtime for near-real-time processing, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for native connectivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams.

Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open after four straight days of declines for the benchmark S&P 500; Investors are bracing for the latest quarterly earnings report from Nvidia, due after the closing bell Wednesday; Lowe's shares are surging after the home improvement giant reported solid earnings a day after rival Home Depot missed profit estimates; Target shares are lower after the retailer reported a larger drop in sales than analysts had forecast; and the Department of Energy is backing a loan to help Constellation Energy reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher as investors digest earnings reports from major retailers and prepare for the highly anticipated release of quarterly results from AI chipmaker Nvidia later today. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The Dow and the S&P 500 have closed lower in each of the past four sessions, while the Nasdaq is riding a two-day losing streak as tech stocks have been under pressure. Bitcoin was at $91,500 recently, down from around $93,000 yesterday afternoon but up from an overnight low of near $90,000. Gold futures were up 1.3% at $4,120 an ounce, gaining ground for the first time in five days, while crude oil futures slipped 2.5% to $59.25 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide range of loans, was little changed, around 4.11%. Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker at the center of the AI boom, is scheduled to release its highly anticipated earnings report after the market closes this afternoon. The report comes as anxiety has built across the market in recent weeks that excitement around AI has created a bubble in the stock market. The chipmaker, which is the world's most valuable company by market capitalization, is expected to report rising revenue and profits. Nvidia shares are expected move significantly after the results are released, which is bound to have a big impact on the broader market and investors in general. The stock, which has lost nearly 15% of its value since hitting an all-time high in late October, was up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Shares of Lowe's Companies (LOW) are rising this morning after the retailer reported strong profits, a day after rival Home Depot's (HD) profits fell short of expectations. Lowe's reported third-quarter earnings per share of $3.06, up from $2.89 a year earlier and topping Wall Street estimates, while sales of $20.81 billion were roughly in line with expectations. The company also lifted its full-year sales outlook to $86 billion, up from $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion, and forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.25, compared with a previous projection of $12.20 to $12.45. Lowe's credited the shift in guidance to "ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment," along with including the impact of recently-acquired Foundation Building Materials. Lowe's shares were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading. Target (TGT) shares are losing ground after the retail giant reported revenue for the third quarter that came in below analysts' estimates. The company's revenue fell 1.5% from a year ago to $25.27 billion, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.78, topping the analyst consensus. Comparable store sales fell 3.8% for Target's retail locations, partially offset by a 2.4% gain in comparable sales online. Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is slated to take over as CEO in February, said the quarter was in line with Target's expectations "despite multiple challenges continuing to face our The retailer also narrowed its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $7.00 to $8.00, versus $7.00 to $9.00 previously. Shares were down 3% in premarket trading. Shares of Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) are rising this morning, a day after the Department of Energy announced its support for a deal involving the power provider. The DOE said Tuesday that it is providing Constellation with a $1 billion loan to help the company restart activity at the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility in Pennsylvania. Last year, Constellation and tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) announced a deal that would see Constellation restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor and provide its power to run some of Microsoft's data centers in the area. Constellation shares were up more than 2% recently.
