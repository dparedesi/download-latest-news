Title: A Google-backed startup raised $350 million to create a future where humans and robots are 'true partners'

Apptronik said Thursday that it had closed its Series A fundraise at roughly $350 million, with plans to use the funding to scale production of its artificial intelligence-powered humanoid robots. The round was led by B Capital, a venture capital firm chaired by Howard Morgan, and Capital Factory, which connects seed-stage technology firms to angel investors and venture capital. Google (GOOGL-0.59%) also participated in the round; its DeepMind AI research lab announced a partnership with Apptronik in December. According to Apptronik, the funding will help it scale work on Apollo, its line of commercial general-purpose humanoid robots introduced in late 2023. The Austin, Texas-based firm in March partnered with Nvidia to integrate its tech into Apollo. It showed off the robots last month at CES 2025. “We’re creating the world’s most advanced and capable humanoid robots, designed to work alongside humans in meaningful and transformative ways,” Apptronik CEO and co-founder Jeff Cardenas said in a statement. “[W]e’re shaping a future where robots become true partners in driving progress.” Like other companies working on humanoid robots, Apollo is designed to perform work in factories, where companies can train and test how the robots perform simple tasks. So far, Apptronik, which was founded at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016, has two commercial partnerships. The first is with GXO Logistics (GXO+7.30%), which also works with Reflex Robotics and Agility Robotics. In June, GXO said Apptronik’s five-foot-eight, 160-pound robots have “great potential to add value throughout the distribution center,” performing repetitive and labor-intensive work. Apptronik’s tech is also being used by Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF+3.28%) for “low skill, physically challenging” labor, the companies said last March. The automaker is testing one robot at a plant in Hungary. “With expanded deployment planned for 2025, Apollo is poised to transform workplaces worldwide,” Apptronik said in a statement. Last August, Cardenas told Forbes that Apptronik was talking with about 60 potential customers, with a commercial launch planned for the end of this year. Even with the latest round, which took its total cash raised to $376 million from $28 million, Apptronik has far less cash than some of its rivals. Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA-1.19%), which has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion, has been testing its Optimus robots in its factories for months and has started hiring more staff to work on the project. Figure AI last February raised $675 million in a Series B round that included Microsoft (MSFT-0.66%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.91%), and Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, giving the company a $2.6 billion valuation. CEO Brett Adcock recently said Figure would exit its partnership with OpenAI and announced his firm had signed its second commercial customer, which is “one of the biggest U.S. companies.” Figure, which began working with BMW last year, could potentially ship 100,0000 robots over the next four years, Adcock wrote on LinkedIn.

U.S. equity markets have fallen for two weeks in a row due, no doubt, to the uncertainty introduced first by the Chinese DeepSeek company which announced an uber-cheap AI model that initially sent Nvidia and other AI stocks reeling (NVDA down more than -18% in January’s last week; recovering about half of that in the market week ended February 7th).6 10 Microsoft (MSFT) shares also tumbled on the DeepSeek news,7 11 while Meta hit an all-time high.2 12 Magnificent 7 As noted in the next table, the tech heavy Nasdaq led the way down over those two weeks, but not all the decline can be blamed on DeepSeek and AI. Equity Markets Part of the markets’ nervousness stems from the uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff program and the uncertainty surrounding his policies in general.3 4 Markets abhor uncertainty. Initially, markets interpreted Trumps 20% tariff threats on Mexico and Canada as bargaining chips that were unlikely to be implemented.5 6 But when the tariff threats became reality, markets became unnerved.5 They calmed a bit when those tariffs were put on a 30-day hold (bargaining chips – Trump style),8 9 but we are likely to see more market nerves as the end of the 30-day period of reprieve approaches. Then on Monday (February 10th), Trump put 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.3 13 While, in the long run, that may cause more domestic production, in the short run, the cost of construction will be rising.3 On Friday, Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) for January came in at +143K, lower than the consensus estimate of +175K.15 16 As we’ve noted in past blogs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adds a number to the NFP every month because their survey includes large and medium size businesses, but no small businesses. That number is supposed to account for small business growth. This is known as the Birth/Death Model, and in January’s data release, that add was +126K.22 23 On net, then, the actual survey count was only +17K (126K+17K = +143K). Also of note, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell from 4.1% in December to 4.0%.15 16 Yet despite this seeming strength, it appears that the labor market is actually softening. Such evidence includes: Average Weekly Hours All the above data leads us to conclude that the “strong” labor market is now showing weakening trends that are likely to have a negative impact in the near-term. In addition, the latest University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index retreated to a score of 67.8 in February, down from January’s 71.1 score. Of note, the Current Conditions sub-index got knocked for a loop, falling to a score of 68.7 in February from January’s 74.0, indicating a rising level of stress in the current environment. Our past blogs have pointed out the lags in the data, especially rents, used by the BLS to calculate CPI inflation. In addition, the media is fixated on the year/year inflation rate. As of December, the official rate of CPI inflation was 2.9% (that’s a year/year calculation).17 25 26 But for the latest six months, it has fallen to +0.9% (Annual Rate) and to +0.4% for the last three months.25 26 Clearly, with falling rents, the monthly rate of inflation is now running well below the Fed’s 2% target. CPI for January is due on Wednesday, February 12th.20 That should provide further information for markets to digest. One note of caution: January often contains automatic annual price increases, especially on the services side (like insurance premiums).25 26 So, the downtrend in the CPI could be at risk. Nevertheless, we still think that the Fed will be lowering the Fed Funds Rate at a much faster pace than currently priced in the market.18 19 And that means that long-term rates, as represented by the 10-Year Treasury Yield, will be falling faster than markets now anticipate. Currently, odds of a rate cut in March are down to 8.5% (was 16% before the NFP number), and those odds were trimmed from 65% to 57% for the Fed’s June meetings.18 Our view is that those odds are way too low, especially in this year’s second half. 10 Year Treasury Yield The DeepSeek AI model (AI may be much cheaper than assumed) injected more uncertainty into the equity markets, causing prices in certain segments of the tech sector to pause (and/or slightly retreat) over the two weeks ending on February 7th.1 7 10 Of course, the tariff issue, especially regarding Mexico and Canada, also played (and continues to play) a significant role in market sentiment.4 5 After all, markets abhor a high and rising level of uncertainty. Add to that the Monday (February 10th) announcement of 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.4 20 The other big data announcement was the Payroll Survey (NFP) which reported +143K (lower than the market consensus of +175K).14 17 23 On Tuesday, February 4th, the JOLTS (Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey) reported a marked decline in hiring rates.5 21 Overall, the data showed a reduction in the workweek and aggregate hours worked in January to the lowest level in nearly five years. In our view, the characterization of the labor market as “strong” by Fed Chair Powell, and by the media, is likely a significant overstatement. The inflation news continues to be hopeful. While the Fed and the media are fixated on the year/year rate of CPI inflation (2.9%), the annualized rate over the past six months has fallen below +1% and to just +0.4% over the past three months.27 26 On a year/year basis (the one the Fed prefers), if recent inflation continues, the rate of CPI inflation is highly likely to be at or below the Fed’s 2% target by the end of June. In this scenario, interest rates will be falling, and the market odds of rate cuts will be rising.18 19 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) One Community. Many Voices.

Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+9.04%) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker’s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.91%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

Chip foundries are responsible for producing a critical part of every piece of technology in the world. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is perhaps the most well-known chip manufacturer, known for fabricating advanced chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). The Taiwan-based chipmaker has a 92% share in advanced AI chip production, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by JPMorgan (JPM). Total global chip foundry revenue was $131.7 billion in 2024, according to TrendForce data cited by the firm. Seven chip foundries, including U.S.-based Tower (TSEM) and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, each have a 1% share of total global revenue, according to the data, while 3% of the total is shared by “Others.” Taiwanese chipmakers command a 70% share of the total revenue, while Korean companies made up 11%, and Chinese chip foundries had 8%. Here are the top six chip producers in the world by revenue share. Chinese pure-play foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor had a 2% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. China’s partially state-owned, pure-play chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as SMIC, had a 5% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. U.S.-based chip designer and manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GFS) had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan’s first chip company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Samsung, one of the world’s main producers of high-bandwidth memory chips, had a 10% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had a 62% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024.

Title: Gold Miners or NVIDIA? You Choose…
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/gold-miners-or-nvidia-you-choose/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T23:00:56Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted February 11, 2025 You have a choice… You can either own Stock A that’s down 10% on the year amid negative headlines. Or you can own Stock B trading at record highs with a 17% return year-to-date. Perhaps it seems like a no-brainer. I prefer to buy strength and sell weakness, so I know I would take Stock B any day. Headlines aside, Stock A’s near-term drawdown puts it at a disadvantage right off the bat. Plus, I find it difficult to pass up new all-time highs. But once we pull back the curtain on our mystery stocks, the choice is far from cut and dry. If you haven’t already guessed, Stock A is Nvidia (NVDA), the market darling that has lost its sparkle. All eyes have been on NVDA for over a year, and it has only intensified (if that’s possible) following the DeepSeek fiasco. To be clear, I’m not bearish on Nvidia. I think it’s the same great company it was three weeks ago. I’m simply looking for opportunities that could provide strength and stability as uncertainty spreads across the market. Opportunities like Stock B: Alamos Gold (AGI). I know we’ve all had our fair share of war stories involving gold mining stocks. But before you start throwing rotten tomatoes, please hear me out… Gold is hitting record highs. And if the shiny yellow rock’s advance measures up to past secular bulls, this rally has legs! Check out the gold chart zoomed out to the mid-1970s. Notice the explosive rallies followed by prolonged trendless markets. After ripping roughly 750% during the 70s, gold went nowhere for my entire youth into early adulthood (almost 25 years). Of course, that changed during the 2000s when gold jumped from $250 bucks to $2,000. Another bout of lifeless action mired precious metal markets until last year. Today, gold is printing record highs. But it’s up a mere 150% off its 2015 low compared to the 650%+ gains of previous bull cycles. Some might attribute gold’s lackluster rally to the real store-of-value asset: Bitcoin. Perhaps. But I view Bitcoin and crypto generally as tech stocks. I’ve never noticed a sustained flight to safety into Bitcoin. Plus, crypto has a strong tendency to trend with the S&P 500 technology sector. My best guess as to why gold hasn’t hit $5k lands somewhere between “no one is paying attention” and “no one wants a dumb yellow rock.” Both work. However, rising gold prices will eventually capture more eyes creating a positive feedback loop as more investors turn to gold — ultimately Making Gold Great Again. Of course, by then it will be too late. Sure, you might capture the last leg or two of the rally, but you’ll also catch the increased volatility. The final stages of commodity bull markets are notoriously violent. Now is the time to consider precious metals, especially mining stocks. Here’s why… During the 2000s bull run, Hecla Mining (HL) gained 2,200% while Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) cruised to a cool 3,300%. These numbers might sound similar to the performance of your favorite tech stock — and they should! Mining stocks become the ultimate speculative growth trade during gold bull markets. And most mining names are trading well below past cycle highs. Here’s gold and the Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) side by side: GDXJ has yet to break above its 2020 high, let alone its 2011 peak. Today, it’s bebopping around $50–$130 below its all-time high set during the last bull run. Imagine the face-ripping rallies across the mining space if and when GDXJ starts to catch toward gold. They’ll look just like Nvidia’s rally off the 2022 lows. A handful of names are already moving. Iamgold (IAG) has climbed 600% over the past two years and its rally has only accelerated since gold’s breakout last year. However, names such as IAG break the mold. The broader mining space has some serious ground to cover… You don’t need to chase $50M market-cap companies — or $500M market-cap companies for that matter. Plenty of solid businesses operate within the metal and mining space. Alamos Gold, Stock B from earlier, touts a $9B market cap. It’s also been around since 2003, which means it survived a full cycle. I like that! And, of course, it’s posting all-time highs. You could also keep it classy by trading one of the bellwethers, like Agnico Eagles Mines (AEM). It broke out of a multi-decade base last week to a new record high. Plus, it’s mined metals and minerals since 1957 and carries a market cap of $47.5B. If you’re feeling lucky and want to take a swing with a five-letter ticker, you will find plenty of gold miners to choose from. I prefer to sleep at night, so I lean toward the larger and more established companies. But Wesdome Gold Mines (WDOFF) is the exception as it teases fresh two-year highs. Could WDOFF post NVDA-like gains? It might if gold continues to rally. Bottom line: Taking a gold position today is taking a position in near-term strength. It’s buying an asset increasing in value — before the crowd shows up and spoils the fun. Don’t get me wrong, I like trading AI stocks as much as anyone else. I simply prefer holding the strongest assets as the market merry-go-round kicks into high gear.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.91%) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.38%) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT-0.66%). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL+0.04%) and Softbank (SFTBY-2.09%) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.

Title: CoinEx Research January 2025 Report: Trumpian Bitcoin Amid Alts Anxiety

February 10, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research's January 2025 report highlights a volatile month that is shaped by political developments, institutional participation, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 to reach a new all-time high, while altcoins struggled due to liquidity drained by Trump-related tokens. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI model further unsettled global tech and crypto markets, leading to a valuation reset. Institutional Bitcoin adoption continued to gain traction, but a late-month pullback raised concerns about potential market consolidation. A Volatile Start to 2025Bitcoin opened the year at approximately $92,500 and closed near $102,000, demonstrating resilience despite a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a strong labour market and persistent inflation, while the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. The launch of the Official Trump Memecoin and Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI) captured market attention, but their liquidity absorption limited altcoin growth. Given the current conditions, Bitcoin may enter a near-term consolidation phase due to the lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The Trump Effect: Memecoins and DeFi Expansion Donald Trump’s influence in the crypto market grew significantly ahead of his inauguration. His team launched the Official Trump Memecoin on Solana’s Meteora platform, bypassing traditional SOL-based liquidity providers like Raydium. This decision helped push Solana’s stablecoin supply beyond $9 billion, a 130% increase, and drove Solana’s DEX trading volume to an all-time high of $258 billion, three times that of Ethereum. The memecoin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion at its peak, surpassing leading memecoins such as SHIB, PEPE, and WIF. The speculative rally continued with the surprise launch of the Melania Token by First Lady Melania Trump, further intensifying trading activity. However, back-to-back token launches exhausted market liquidity, leading to an eventual pullback. Meanwhile, the Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI), a DeFi project on Ethereum, successfully raised over $300 million in its presale. This signaled that the Trump crypto narrative extended beyond memecoins to include institutional-style DeFi products, blending speculative and financial elements. DeepSeek AI’s Disruptive Impact on Global Markets China’s DeepSeek AI model, launched just before the Lunar New Year, sent shockwaves through global AI and financial markets. With a training cost significantly lower than its Western counterparts—DeepSeek introduced a cost-efficient alternative powered by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This method optimizes computational efficiency by selectively activating only the most relevant sub-networks per query. DeepSeek’s debut triggered a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) plummeting 17% in a single day as investors reassessed the competitive landscape. AI-themed crypto tokens also suffered heavy losses due to broader risk-off sentiment. However, rather than being a structural threat, DeepSeek’s emergence represents a necessary market recalibration that could accelerate AI adoption and unlock new crypto-related opportunities. Source: LiveBench Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Policy Shifts Institutional participation in Bitcoin remained strong in January, supported by major policy developments. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda established a crypto task force, and President Trump signed an executive order in his first week promoting crypto innovation, signaling a shift toward broader adoption. In Illinois, lawmakers advanced a bill to create a state Bitcoin reserve, following Arizona’s move to integrate cryptocurrency into public finance. Outside the U.S., sovereign institutions also increased their Bitcoin exposure. The Czech Central Bank approved Bitcoin for inclusion in its national reserves, while Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund disclosed a 150% year-on-year increase in its Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding $350 million. These moves highlighted a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value among government treasuries and institutional investors. Stablecoin Inflows and Market Caution Stablecoins continued to see strong inflows, with approximately $9.9 billion entering the market in January. This sustained a three-month trend of capital influx, supporting the bullish structure of the market. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs coincided with these inflows, reinforcing the importance of stablecoin liquidity in market momentum. However, despite the positive trend, a notable market pullback in late January suggests a cautious outlook. If stablecoin inflows slow or turn into net outflows, the market could face a period of consolidation, leading to increased volatility. Investors should closely monitor stablecoin trends as an indicator of broader market sentiment. Market Outlook for February 2025 Looking ahead, the market’s direction in February will be shaped by institutional developments, regulatory policies, and stablecoin movements. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends.

Title: DeepSeek's efficiency means Big Tech must stop hoarding, creating more winners. Here are the 12 stocks expected to benefit.

The good, bad, and the ugly are merging as AI enters the next stage of development: competition and efficiency. We all knew this day would come, but perhaps not as soon as it did. DeepSeek's more efficient and cheaper model means Big Tech suddenly has a chink in its armor. Investors question whether they have overvalued the blue chips and their pricing power, especially concerning their proprietary language models. It will be a volatile ride until Wall Street figures that out. For now, AI-related stocks have been dumping almost indiscriminately or at the slightest hint of a slowdown. Chip designer ARM was a recent victim of that trend. It announced earnings Wednesday with some of the best numbers you can get on a typical stock, said Sandeep Rao, a quantitative analyst at Leverage Shares ETPs. Still, the stock closed down by over 7%. "It's clearly evident that this stock is supposed to be soaring," Rao said. "The company's IP is used in virtually every major smartphone in the world. Its software is also used by Apple computers. It has a tie-up with Nvidia, and its backup is SoftBank, which is part of the Stargate project pumping $500 billion into AI cloud infrastructure." ARM CEO Rene Haas also welcomed DeepSeek during its February 5 earnings call, referring to it as "creative" and a welcomed efficiency that would only increase demand for computing. He added that his company was well-positioned to take advantage of efficiencies, including for smaller devices that don't require high-powered Nvidia chips. ARM isn't alone. As AI stocks report earnings, they find themselves in a similar predicament: explaining to Wall Street's money movers that they are well-positioned to continue riding out the AI hype. DeepSeek isn't exactly open source; in other words, it doesn't share its full code. It's open weight, which means it shows its memory or knowledge process. This allows users to adjust it for specific tasks, lowering the bar for startups and companies to enter the space and create specialized business models that could lead to affordability, increased demand, and explosive growth. Before DeepSeek, proprietary models required huge computing power, which meant expensive and small supercomputers were the perceived solution for efficiency. DeepSeek changed that thesis, suggesting that optimization isn't a hardware problem but one that can be addressed with code, Rao said. It also proved that the open-source community was far more efficient at driving results, validating the argument that AI and machine learning should not be done behind closed doors, Rao added. It's a technology that can best be done as a tide that lifts all boats instead of one that's hoarded by a few. But in terms of winners and losers, investors should be concerned with the picks and shovels: companies tasked with building AI infrastructure, said Abby Yoder, a US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. The focus must now turn to their revenue and gross margin line items to determine whether they will see the impact. She added that CapEx spending isn't dropping; it's actually increasing, but it could be shifting elsewhere. "So, are they going to be going to the incumbent winners that we've seen over the past couple of years who have had this outsized pricing power leading to those really high margins?" Yoder said. Or are they going to semiconductor companies making specialized chips, hardware providers, or software companies? It's the key query investors will need to be able to answer if they want to continue winning in this space. On JPMorgan's part, the investment bank's North America equity research team created a list of stocks they're overweight on and that they expect will be positively impacted by competitive and efficient AI. Software Companies that can use efficiency to increase their total addressable markets will be the new big winners. Here, Yoder believes it will be the software companies. Cloud-based data storage provider Snowflake (SNOW) is positioned to benefit from increased demand as more AI applications develop, increasing the requirement for data storage services. Cloud-based software provider Salesforce (CRM) could be at the forefront of benefiting from cheaper and therefore increased software use. Semiconductors In the semiconductor space, Yoder says an investor should focus on those gaining versus those losing market share. Overall, the demand for AI chips is expected to increase, not drop, though that may not be the case for every chipmaker, read JPMorgan's note. Within this sector, companies that provide application-specific integrated circuits" (ASICs), which are microchips made for certain functions instead of general use, are well-positioned to gain from the increased use of more accessible AI models. ASIC suppliers set to benefit include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL). Micron (MU) is expected to benefit as a memory and storage chip provider as AI adoption accelerates. Despite fears about how necessary Nvidia's (NVDA) expensive and advanced chips will be, increased demand for AI models will also mean increased demand for GPUs. Internet and hyperscalers The big, leading names like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta sit in this category. Not only are they developers of AI models, but they are also the spenders that largely determine where money for infrastructure and software will go. Here, efficiency will create a cheaper and broader ecosystem for AI on the internet, and the sharing of developments will push the big players to also become efficient, read JPMorgan's note, which projects 2025 capex spending for Amazon at $97 billion, Meta at $65 billion, and Google at $62 billion. Since Meta's Llama model is also open weight, it's expected to be a main beneficiary of language models like DeepSeek, where its efficiency can be integrated into Meta's ecosystem. "At 4Q earnings, META reiterated the benefits of open source LLMs, noted that costs can be driven down, & — in light of DeepSeek — emphasized the importance of having an American standard for open source that extends globally," JP Morgan's note read. Amazon is also not shying away from more efficacious models. Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to
