Title: XAI Grok 4.2 May Have Cracked the Code on Trading

Home » Artificial intelligence » XAI Grok 4.2 May Have Cracked the Code on Trading xAI Grok 4.20 created a 47% return in the Nasdaq and outperformed all others in the Alpha Arena competition. 32 instances of various LLMs (including multiple variants of the same model under different prompting strategies like “Situational Awareness,” “Monk Mode,” “Max Leverage,” and “New Baseline”) were each allocated $10,000 in real money to trade autonomously on the Nasdaq exchange. The total capital across all participants was $320,000. Models had to generate trading ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human intervention, using only market data inputs. This lasted 2 weeks and focused on volatile tech stocks, including Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), and others. Grok 4.20 executed 105 trades and dominated the leaderboard, with its top instance (Situational Awareness strategy) achieving a +47% return (growing $10,000 to $14,698), with an aggregate return across its instances cited as approximately 12.11% (possibly an averaged or weighted figure).

Captain America vs Captain America… neither side wins The FIRST to use AI will do well but then the market will balance out when everyone else starts using AI. I think buying and holding will still end up being the best way to grow investments if this turns out to be a reality once there is more long-term data. But, what I could see is a boon for prediction markets with LLMs being able to make at least semi-accurate predictions better than humans, based on being able to interpret vast amounts of information from different sources very quickly. Not for sports, but for other events such as weather, natural disasters, etc. Replying to myself, but the live stream actually did mention someone cleaning house on Polymarket which was exactly where my mind was going. The top 1% of American households owns around 30-31% of the total U.S. wealth, a share that has grown significantly over recent decades, while the bottom 50% holds a mere 2-3%. After the billionaire tech bros put most people out of work and take their share of the productivity gains, do you really think they will stop there? They will look around at who still has wealth, and look for ways to take control of that. Specifically share holders. AI gives them the power to manipulate the share market. With this they can accumulate even more of the wealth share. Also, most rich people see shareholders as an impediment. If AI can help them to retake full control of their businesses (Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft etc) then why would they not do that? After all every billionaire really wants to be a trillionaire. Communism was shown to be busted in the 20th century. Capitalism has been the most successful system so far but perhaps capitalism will cease to function in the 21st century, or perhaps it can be successfully modified? This means all those annoying traderobot ads targetting the inexperienced traders on the net are scams, Already, most trading is done by autonomous trading algorithms, trading in microseconds against each other, so much so that being physically close to the stock exchange is worth millions in electron proximity. Sometimes these programs exaggerate moves of a stock or even sector, especially volatile sectors like tech, but also small caps. In one famous instance, that also pointed to other less spectacular moves of the S&P index, a “Flash Crash” from the algorithms, resulted in several arrests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash “New regulations put in place following the 2010 flash crash[10] proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash — “when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value”[10] — and ETFs were subsequently put under greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.[10] On April 21, 2015, nearly five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid 22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation, against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British financial trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later.[11] These orders amounting to about “$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall” were “replaced or modified 19,000 times” before they were canceled.[11] Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned.[4] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation concluded that Sarao “was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances” in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.[11] Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified “so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically”.[11]” So, there are/were guardrails in place, but will they work against AI? Maybe more importantly, will a neutered SEC, CFTB, DOJ, and other agencies both in the U.S. and abroad be allowed to curb such activity? Trump’s administration has said no one should hinder the development of AI, and has been the most pro-crypto currency – a form of virtual speculation on something with no underlying value – administration in the world. Eventually, there should be enough AI competing against each other that they should cancel each other out; some will short the market/stocks too. using leverage that might bankrupt the company, sector and even potentially the entire banking sector – see: Long Term Capital Management in 1997: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management. This wasn’t AI but its sophisticated trading derivatives might have been similar to what AI could do in minutes instead of months. Faced with AI that’s too fast and unpredictable to keep up with, and tax and trading costs that whittle advantages down to nothing (what was the tax liability of these AI systems in the test?), the smartest thing for ordinary investors to do might be the oldest: Buy and Hold and index of top stocks. This was inevitable, it’s why I think their is zero chance the stock market exists in a few years, unless they globally institute massive changes, which will impact day traders the most. I think they will have to put limits in place on how fast you can buy or sell a stock, and a mandatory time of holding a stock (IE:24hrs). Comment

Title: Stocks Have Rebounded Ahead of the Fed Meeting—But the Market's Leaders Are Changing

The stock market may not be roaring into the most wonderful time of the year, but it is chugging along. Its next big test, however, is right around the corner. Investors' attention has for days largely been fixed on Wednesday's rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Rising optimism that the Fed will cut at its last meeting of 2025—based on futures market data, it's viewed as a near-certainty—has helped the major indexes recover most of the ground they lost during the volatile first three weeks of November; the major U.S. indexes are within a few percentage points of fresh records as this week draws to a close. A lot changed below the surface last month. The Magnificent Seven group of tech heavyweights— Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—nearly entered a technical correction as investors debated whether big tech was spending too much on artificial intelligence. On Nov. 20, a blowout earnings report from Nvidia failed to put AI bubble fears to rest, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) closed the day 9% below its record high. It's not that long ago that there was serious doubt among investors about whether the Fed would cut rates at its December meeting, the last of the year. Now it's seen as a virtual certainty. That might increase investor appetite for risk assets, but in the runup to the meeting a broader slice of stocks has been climbing. This year’s least-loved sectors, meanwhile, including healthcare and energy, became leaders. More than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index last month, compared with just 33% since the start of the year, suggesting “a change of leadership heading into 2026,” according to Bank of America analysts. Eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors outperformed the broader index, they wrote, while tech lagged. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, an index that tracks the stocks of companies that move goods and people around the country, rose for a tenth consecutive day on Friday. According to Dow Theory, that's a bullish sign for stocks if observed alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average. (The Dow Industrials rose on Friday, and is up nearly 5% over the past two weeks.) Fed officials are divided on how to proceed. Some policymakers fear that cutting rates too aggressively will stoke inflation, which has run above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years and reaccelerated in recent months. Others fear that leaving rates unchanged will harm the weakening job market, potentially tipping the U.S. economy into recession. The government shutdown delayed the release of several vital economic reports, leaving officials no choice but to fly partially blind next week. The most recent official labor market data that policymakers have sent mixed signals, but data from private sources suggest the job market has continued to soften. The private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November, according to payroll provider ADP. Employers announced more than 150,000 layoffs in October, the highest number for that month since 2003. Wall Street generally expects the Fed will prioritize employment over inflation next week, moving to bring rates lower. Investors see an 87% chance the Fed cuts interest rates, according to federal funds futures trading data. Just two weeks ago, that figure was 30%. Update—December 5, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect the end of trading on Friday.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Tells Joe Rogan AI Race Is Real, But It Won’t Have a Clear Winner

Time Published: 2025-12-03T20:08:28Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t think the artificial intelligence race will be decided in a single breakthrough. On The Joe Rogan Experience, Huang cast AI’s acceleration as the latest chapter in a long-running global competition for technological advantage, one that has repeatedly redrawn geopolitical lines, from World War II through the Cold War. “We’ve always been in a tech race with someone,” Huang said, likening today’s push for AI leadership to the Manhattan Project. The difference, he argued, is tempo: rather than a sudden, decisive finish line, AI will advance in waves, continuous gains that are easy to miss in the moment but obvious in hindsight. That doesn’t mean the stakes are modest, according to the CEO of one of the biggest manufacturers of the the chips AI firms need to operate. Huang said AI systems have become roughly 100 times more capable over the last two years, a rate of progress that has fueled public anxiety about autonomous weapons and machines operating beyond human moral constraints. Huang’s counterpoint: much of the momentum is flowing into functionality and safety, making systems more reliable, more useful and less error-prone, he claimed. He also defended the U.S. military’s role in AI development, suggesting that defense involvement can normalize the technology’s place in national security rather than leaving it to shadowy, unaccountable actors. Rogan pressed on a familiar set of fears: AI outpacing human judgment, and the longer-term threat that quantum computing could crack modern encryption. Huang pushed back, arguing that AI will remain “a click ahead," and that history is full of moments when society panicked over its newest inventions, only to adapt once the technology became legible and regulated. If Huang has an ideal end state, it’s not a single winner hoisting a trophy. It’s something quieter: AI becoming infrastructure, fading into the background as it powers everyday systems, from healthcare to transportation, less a conquering intelligence than a new layer of computing people stop noticing because it simply works.

Title: We Might Finally Get Some Big AI IPOs—Which Would Mean a Look at Their Financials
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/we-might-finally-get-some-big-ai-ipos-and-a-look-at-their-financials-anthropic-openai-11861238
Time Published: 2025-12-03T19:00:41Z
Full Content:
Here come the big AI IPOs. (Maybe.) Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot, is preparing for an initial public offering that could come next year, according to the Financial Times. The company is also said to be in talks to raise funding that would push its valuation over $300 billion. The report followed others saying OpenAI, the company behind rival ChatGPT, is also getting ready for an IPO that could drive its valuation to $1 trillion. Spokespeople for both Anthropic and OpenAI denied having set plans for an IPO in those reports. The first of these companies to reach public markets will set the bar for the rest—and open up the AI-investment landscape beyond the biggest publicly traded tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META), whose stock valuations have lately stoked concerns of bubble-ish excesses. It would also give the masses a good look at the economics of AI language-model developers. Elon Musk's xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot, in late November was said to be preparing to close a $15 billion fundraising round in December, pushing its pre-money valuation to $230 billion. The most well-known AI frontier startups—companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Databricks, Perplexity and xAI—are private. One going public could prompt others to follow, which would open up the AI investment landscape beyond the chipmakers and Big Tech companies that investors have poured dollars into. IPO documents, particularly those called S-1 filings, are rich sources of information, because companies are legally bound to give public-market investors a thorough look at the business before they raise funds from them. The big reveal is in the financials—what revenue growth looks like, profit margins, and how much cash companies are burning to develop new products, the latter of which has been a source of AI investor angst. They'll also show companies' cap tables, detailing their ownership structure. Filings from Anthropic or OpenAI would adress a lot of investor questions about the state of frontier AI development. Meanwhile, private markets are flush with AI startups. The sector has drawn roughly 65% of venture capital investments in 2025 through the third quarter, according a PitchBook's report published this week. Though that figure is skewed by the multibillion-dollar fundraising rounds of a few big startups, it also shows how ubiquitous such startups have become. "No other emerging technology has accounted for a larger share of total deal activity," PitchBook director of research Kyle Stanford and his team wrote in the report. The old high-water mark was in early 2013, when mobile accounted for roughly 20% of deal counts; AI accounts for 35% currently. That could make for an exciting pipeline of coming IPOs if one AI startup unlocks the floodgates to public markets. But it could also fuel Dotcom bubble comparisons.

Stock futures are slightly higher and bitcoin is rising as the market looks to add to yesterday's gains; AI company Anthropic is reportedly considering an initial public offering; Apple is expected to post its best year of iPhone sales thanks to strong demand in China; shares of Marvell Technology are soaring after the chip company reported strong earnings; and American Eagle stock is surging after the retailer said its performance got a boost from its affiliations with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open this morning as the market looks to gain ground for the second straight session after having a week-long winning streak snapped on Monday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq were up 0.2% recently. The major indexes posted solid gains on Tuesday as tech stocks rallied and bitcoin rebounded from a recent sell-off. Bitcoin was trading at $93,000 recently, up from an overnight low of around $91,000 and a low on Monday below $84,000. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,245 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 1.3% to $59.40 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.06%, down from 4.09% at yesterday's close. AI company Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and the maker of the Claude chatbot, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering the Financial Times reported. The company is reportedly working with a high-profile IPO law firm, and is in preliminary talks with banks to gauge interest. Anthropic is also considering raising more funding privately, with a new round that could include $15 billion from AI heavyweights Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and would value Anthropic at over $300 billion. AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI have commanded tremendous amounts of money from the private capital markets in recent years, but few purely AI companies are on the stock market today. Reports have also suggested that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is considering an IPO, but not in the immediate future, according to CNBC. Going public would require more financial disclosures than OpenAI and Anthropic are required to provide as private companies, and test how prepared investors are to put money into AI chatbot makers that have been burning through tens of billions in recent years with an unclear path to profitability. Apple (AAPL) is expected to post a record number of smartphone shipments globally in 2025 thanks to the success of its iPhone 17 model, according to data released by International Data Corporation. IDC estimates that Apple shipments will surpass 247 million units this year, a 6.1% increase from the year before. Huge demand in China is primarily responsible for the surge. IDC projects that Apple's China sales for the fourth quarter will be 17% higher than a year ago, while sales growth for the full year will be up 3%, both well above previous projections. IDC expects the global smartphone market to contract by 0.9% in 2026 owing to a shortage of memory components. Also, Apple reportedly has considered moving the iPhone 18 launch to early 2027 rather than its typical fall announcement and release window. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) are soaring in premarket trading after the semiconductor manufacturer topped profit estimates and announced a $3.25 billion acquisition. Marvell posted earnings in its fiscal 2026 third quarter of 76 cents per share, slightly topping the Wall Street consensus, while revenue of $2.07 billion matched analysts' estimates. Meanwhile, Marvell announced a deal to acquire Celestial AI, whose technology Marvell says can help make the servers inside the data centers that train and run AI models more efficient. Marvell expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, with Celestial AI meaningfully contributing to revenue by the back half of fiscal 2028. Marvell stock, which through yesterday's close was down 16% since the start of the year, rose more than 10% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are surging after the clothing retailer posted strong results and raised its outlook. The clothing retailer behind its namesake brand and others including Aerie said Tuesday it generated $1.36 billion in revenue in the third quarter, along with earnings per share of $0.53. Each was higher than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Comparable store sales rose 4% across the whole company. American Eagle lifted its forecasts for sales growth and operating income for the fourth quarter. In its earnings call, CEO Jay Schottenstein called out the company's recent marketing partnerships with celebrities such as actress Sydney Sweeney and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, saying they delivered "measurable benefits," per an AlphaSense transcript.
