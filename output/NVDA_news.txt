Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/26/nvidia-stockthe-road-to-200/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T10:00:51Z
Full Content:
Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Ever since shares of Nvidia (NVDA) reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experienced some turbulence — but its market cap is still up over 150% so far this year. Nvidia’s shares were up 2.37% during mid-day trading Monday at $123.73 per share — down around 9% from its record-high close price of $135.58 on June 18, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156.86% so far this year, boosting its market cap just above $3 trillion and making it the third-most valuable company in the world. Compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the generative artificial intelligence boom due to high demand for its Hopper graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used for training and inferencing of some of the world’s most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, samples of Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, are shipping to customers, and the product is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. In August, reports that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws sent Nvidia’s shares down. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. However, despite reporting another record quarter that beat Wall Street’s expectations, Nvidia’s shares slipped in August, reflecting unimpressed investors who want more from the chipmaker.

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang concluded a planned sale of more than $700 million worth of company stock, regulatory filings Tuesday showed. Huang had previously announced his intention to sell as many as 6 million shares of Nvidia by the first quarter of 2025 under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC's) 10b5-1 rule, which allows insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks. He reached that limit months ahead of the plan's expiration, with the sale of 120,000 shares worth nearly $14.3 million, according to an SEC filing. The CEO still holds 75.4 million Nvidia shares directly and another 786 million through various trusts and a partnership, according to another filing. Shares of Nvidia closed nearly 4% higher at $120.87 Tuesday. They've more than doubled in value since the start of the year amid booming demand for the company's chips to support artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why

Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below. ANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025? TONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group. One of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction. AM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year? TR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks. And we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies. And then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. AM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that? TR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy. So the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily. Sure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street is rapidly pivoting away from gnashing its proverbial teeth over NVIDIA's peaking margins just a few weeks back to now rushing to incorporate the Blackwell production ramp-up in its collective bullish thesis, replete with expectations of a phenomenal surge in revenue from the GPU manufacturer's latest flagship product. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the rumors of a Blackwell architecture design flaw had dominated the narrative around NVIDIA throughout the summer, with analysts contending that the flaw's rectification would relegate the Blackwell production ramp-up to a predominantly calendar year 2025 phenomenon. Then, while announcing its earnings for the June-ending quarter, NVIDIA confirmed the rumors of a minor design flaw but noted that the shortcomings were rectified by making a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. Critically, the company announced at the time that it expected to start shipping Blackwell products in the December-ending quarter, with Hopper shipments also expected to increase. $NVDA Morgan Stanley says Hopper/Blackwell demand is strong - Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company - The Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) September 24, 2024 Now, Wall Street appears to be front-running NVIDIA's relatively cautious guidance by going a giant step forward. To wit, Morgan Stanley has now disclosed that it expects NVIDIA to ship 450,000 Blackwell chips in the December-ending quarter, earning ~$10 billion in revenue from this architecture alone: "Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for NVIDIA." While Morgan Stanley concedes that NVIDIA is still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, the Wall Street titan posits a qualifier that such issues are a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." What's more, Morgan Stanley still sees a very healthy demand profile for NVIDIA's H200 chips, courtesy of sovereign AI projects and smaller cloud service providers continuing to expand their capacity.

NVIDIA (NVDA) is experiencing strong demand for its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The investment bank said in a note Tuesday that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company. Morgan Stanley reports that Oracle recently announced plans to build a Zettascale AI supercluster powered by 131,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs, delivering 2.4 ZettaFLOPS of AI performance. Oracle’s request for more GPU supply has provided a boost to Nvidia’s outlook, as well as to its suppliers in the semiconductor industry. "At a recent event, Oracle reportedly requested more GPU supply, which was upbeat news for the Asia AI semi/system supply chain," wrote the bank. Morgan Stanley now expects TSMC’s CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity to increase to 80,000-90,000 wafers per month by 2025, up from a previous estimate of 70,000. In the near term, Nvidia’s Hopper GPU demand is said to remain strong, alleviating concerns about potential inventory risks. According to Morgan Stanley, the Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller cloud service providers and sovereign AI projects. Meanwhile, Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for Nvidia. Morgan Stanley also notes that while Nvidia is still resolving some technical challenges with its GB200 server racks, these issues are part of the normal debugging process for new product launches. Hon Hai, Nvidia’s assembly partner, is reportedly on track to begin shipments of the GB200 server rack by late Q4 2024. Morgan Stanley maintains a bullish outlook on Nvidia’s AI supply chain, favoring it over memory, PC, and cloud segments as Nvidia continues to capitalize on the growing demand for AI semiconductors.

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

Title: Why Some Analysts Say Qualcomm's Potential Takeover of Intel is 'Impractical'

Intel (INTC) shares have gained ground as investors reacted to a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that said Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a “takeover approach” to the beleaguered chipmaker. However, securities analysts are less keen on the idea, with those at Bank of America calling it “intriguing but perhaps impractical.” A Qualcomm takeover could offer Intel a lifeline for its struggling foundry business, which produces chips for outside customers, the firm noted in a research note released on Saturday. Intel could fill its manufacturing facilities with Qualcomm products, and Qualcomm could become a significant customer for Intel’s silicon wafers. That said, Intel is saddled with more than $50 billion in debt, and Qaulcomm has just $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, making a takeover deal difficult, the BofA analysts said. In addition, the move could “create confusion given potential for headcount and roadmap disruptions,” making such a merger a potential boon for rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). For a Qualcomm-Intel deal to go through, it likely would require a level of buy-in from the U.S. and Chinese governments, analysts at JPMorgan wrote over the weekend. Qualcomm could look for the U.S. government to provide a capital commitment to the foundry business, the success of which is important to domestic semiconductor production. Then there’s regulatory approval from China, which analysts acknowledge would be a major obstacle for such a move. The country "historically has taken years to even consider medium sized transactions," the BofA analysts said. Over the weekend, Apollo Global Management offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. Intel previously agreed to sell Apollo a 49% stake in a chipmaking site in Ireland in June. Shares of Intel gained 3.3% on Monday, while Qualcomm stock was down 1.8%.

Title: Intel needs Qualcomm, but it's not a two-way street, analysts say

After missing second-quarter earnings expectations and seeing its stock fall over 50% so far this year, Intel (INTC) is still attracting interest worth billions of dollars. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is reportedly interested in taking over the chip pioneer in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. And alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has also offered an equity-like investment that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world. However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits, and added they are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Arm. Here are three reasons Bank of America and other analysts say Qualcomm wouldn’t benefit much from an Intel takeover. A deal between a chip designer and a company with the factories to make those chips looks sensible from above, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note — but it doesn’t actually “fit so well.” While Qualcomm uses British chip firm Arm’s architecture for its PC chips, Intel’s x86 processors, which are used in a lot of computer and server hardware, are designed differently. Bank of America analysts also noted the difference, saying Qualcomm’s “existing established relationships” on the Arm architecture make “it tougher to bring product” to Intel’s mostly x86-based fabs. Meanwhile, Windsor said Intel’s x86 processors are “under assault on all fronts from Arm and accelerated computing,” and that Qualcomm has already spent two decades competing against Intel’s chips in the mobile and PC market. “Consequently, it makes no sense to become the owner of a fading titan when one is in a good position to partially or completely displace it from the market,” Windsor said. And Qualcomm already has a relationship with other chipmakers such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung, Windsor said, meaning it already knows “how to design its chips to be optimally manufactured on these processes.” Therefore, having to redesign its chips to be manufactured by Intel, which has already slipped behind with cutting edge chips, “sounds like a risky proposition to me,” he said. If Qualcomm does go through with an acquisition, it would come at a premium to Intel’s current expected value of $87 billion, Bank of America analysts said, adding that Intel also has about $53 billion in debt. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, analysts said. Intel is also planning to spend billions to support a growing fab network, including a five-year, $100 billion expansion plan for plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. While the chipmaker is expecting to receive almost $20 billion in direct federal funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to support the effort, it makes up a small portion of how much the expansion plan is expected to cost. Meanwhile, the chipmaker recently saw its shares close on a high after the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it is eligible for a separate $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding under the Secure Enclave program. Windsor also said in his note that “Qualcomm would almost certainly pay for Intel with shares” which would lead to “dilution for existing holders of Qualcomm’s stock” (which includes Windsor). And while Intel’s shares have fallen this year, Windsor said it’s still “not cheap” due to the chipmaker’s falling revenue. Bank of America analysts said the potential deal faces a “tough regulatory environment, specifically in China,” where medium sized deals have, in the past, “taken years to even consider.” Therefore, analysts said, the potential to dominate the CPU market would actually work against a takeover, because it could face regulatory challenges. For example, the analysts noted Qualcomm’s failed acquisition of Dutch semiconductor company NXP (NXPI) in 2018, after it did not receive approval from China’s antitrust regulator.

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward.

Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.
