ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/11: In this photo illustration, the Rigetti Computing logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

As these applications evolve from proof-of-concept to commercial usage, the potential for revenue could increase dramatically. The transition to cloud-based quantum computing services signifies a major revenue opportunity. D-Wave’s cloud-based quantum computing offerings position it to gain substantial market share in this swiftly expanding area, enabling customers to utilize quantum computing capabilities without significant capital expenditures. Related – What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Quantum computing has emerged as a national security priority, with governments worldwide making considerable investments in quantum research and development. D-Wave’s established technologies and collaborations position it to secure valuable long-term government contracts, providing consistent revenue streams and validation for commercial applications. For instance, D-Wave has successfully completed a significant defense-oriented installation through its partnership with Davidson Technologies. The physical setup of a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum system is finalized at Davidson’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama, marking the first annealing quantum computer to be hosted on-site in the state. NVIDIA serves as the most pertinent comparison for QBTS’s potential growth trajectory. Between 2016 and 2024, NVIDIA stock surged from around $8 to more than $130 (adjusted for splits), marking a 16x increase. This expansion occurred as NVIDIA evolved from a gaming graphics firm to a core component of AI infrastructure. Similarly, D-Wave may capitalize on the burgeoning quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to over $400 in 2020-2021, illustrating how groundbreaking applications can lead to explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly disrupt industries once they gain commercial traction. The company is subject to a variety of inherent risks. D-Wave Quantum is distinctively positioned to benefit from the shift of quantum computing from research to commercial implementation. The company’s technological dominance, first-mover advantage, and an expanding market create major opportunities for growth by tenfold over the next 3-5 years. The prevailing conditions, characterized by rising computational demands, considerable government spending, and the maturing of quantum applications, resemble the introductory phases of the internet or AI revolution. D-Wave’s established technology and commercial emphasis position it to capture disproportionate value as this evolution accelerates. Although significant risks remain, the chance for revolutionary impact across various industries warrants a premium valuation for investors with the suitable risk appetite and long-term investment perspectives. We underscore the considerable risk tied to this investment; therefore, investors should thoughtfully evaluate these risks or consider professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio with a selection of 30 stocks that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded greater returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Larry Ellison, Oracle Corp.’s ORCL co-founder and chairman, has once again overtaken Meta Platforms, Inc. META CEO Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's second-richest person. This is despite them both having $251 billion net worth. What Happened: According to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Ellison and Zuckerberg are tied at $251 billion, but because Ellison has gained $59 billion this year while the Meta CEO is up $43.4 billion, the Oracle co-founder might have placed above. This ranks him just after Tesla Inc. TSLA and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who remains the world's richest person at $358 billion. Others in the top five wealthiest individuals list are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos and former Microsoft Corporation MSFT CEO Steve Ballmer, with net worths of $247 billion and $174 billion, respectively. See Also: Nvidia Says ‘Washington Gets It’ After Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks Says US Has To ‘Outcompete’ Global Rivals Why It’s Important: Ellison's wealth, more than 80% of which is tied to Oracle stock and options, soared as Oracle shares climbed 47.27% in the last six months, reported Bloomberg. The rally followed news on Tuesday that the U.S. government would ease export restrictions, allowing chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD to resume selling some semiconductors to China. Oracle, which relies on high-end chips for its cloud and AI infrastructure, was among the top beneficiaries of the policy shift with a gain of 2.48% during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to Benzinga Pro. The company has also inked multibillion-dollar cloud deals and ramped up partnerships with firms including OpenAI and SoftBank Group SFTBF SFTBY as part of its Stargate initiative. Oracle's stock has also nearly tripled since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the report said. According to Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, Oracle is demonstrating strong positive momentum in the short, medium and long term. Additional performance insights are available here.

Title: NVDA Stock To $200?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BEIJING, CHINA - JULY 15: Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp, ... More receives a media group interview before attending the welcome dinner of the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) on July 15, 2025 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Wan Quan/VCG via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has announced that it received confirmations from the Trump administration permitting it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after encountering a ban around April. This development comes just days after Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump. This decision represents a significant victory for Nvidia, which had been affected by stringent U.S. export controls designed to limit China’s access to advanced AI technology. The H20 chip, specifically created to adhere to U.S. regulations on chip exports, is less powerful than Nvidia’s leading products but has continued to be in high demand among Chinese clients. Separately, could oil help foster peace? See Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified. Nvidia recorded a $4.5 billion write-off in its most recent quarter due to unsold H20 chips that it could not reallocate to other markets. If sales of these high-volume chips to China resume, reversing some of this write-off could enhance earnings. Nvidia stock has been a strong performer this year, climbing nearly 18% to approximately $170 per share. Now, could easing U.S.-China tech tensions propel the next phase of Nvidia’s climb towards the $200 threshold? (related:What’s Happening With XRP Price?) China represents a vast and swiftly expanding AI market, hosting tech behemoths like Baidu and Alibaba, along with newcomers such as DeepSeek, that are increasingly competing with the U.S. in AI software development. Nevertheless, China still significantly lags in AI hardware, as domestic AI chips produced by companies like Huawei do not match the performance delivered by Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs. This establishes a profound dependence on Nvidia's technology to fulfill China’s AI aspirations. Simultaneously, China is an essential market for Nvidia. The nation generated $17 billion in revenue for the company in the fiscal year concluding in January 2025, which is roughly 13% of Nvidia’s total revenue. Moreover, this figure may not fully capture the breadth of the situation. Numerous Chinese tech firms have reportedly utilized gray market resellers and overseas intermediaries in nations like Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam to circumvent U.S. export restrictions and acquire Nvidia’s top-tier chips. These activities have led to governments enhancing enforcement measures and instigating crackdowns. Should the technology trade conflict ease, the recommencement of direct sales could substitute some of this shadow demand, offering Nvidia a clearer and more scalable growth trajectory in China. Nvidia is concentrating on balancing its response to this Chinese demand while adhering to U.S. regulations. The company additionally stated that it has created a new AI chip for China, aimed at applications in factory automation and logistics. This chip is based on Nvidia's most advanced Blackwell architecture but includes downgrades in certain features to address concerns raised by the U.S. government regarding the export of cutting-edge technology to China. While Nvidia stock has momentum in its favor, we consider that the stock may already be somewhat overvalued. We value Nvidia stock at approximately $130 per share, around 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more information. Certainly, Nvidia trades at about 40x forward earnings, which is justifiable considering that the company is set to increase revenues by 55% according to consensus estimates. However, there are some reasons to exercise caution. While Nvidia continues to be the benchmark for AI, the rally driven by "fear of missing out" that has propelled the stock over the past two years might start to lose momentum. Over the last three years, major technology companies have invested heavily in training increasingly larger AI models, significantly elevating the demand for Nvidia’s high-performance chips. Nonetheless, incremental performance improvements from larger AI models could begin to plateau, and the availability of high-quality training data may also present as a bottleneck. Additionally, the AI landscape may begin shifting from training to inference, where efficiency and cost become more significant than sheer power. In this transition, AMD’s MI series and open-source models might become more competitive. AMD’s ROCm software platform, although not as sophisticated as Nvidia’s CUDA, is expected to be sufficient for many inference tasks. This potential transition in AI workloads, combined with the risks associated with growth normalization, could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia’s most powerful and costly GPUs, potentially slowing the pace of its earnings growth in the future. Worried about the risks to NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; exhibiting less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday Tuesday as tech stocks got a boost from semiconductor stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed, while the S&P 500 and Dow dropped. Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares surged after the Trump administration reversed course and said it will allow the companies to sell key AI chips to China again. Shares of MP Materials (MP) soared after Apple (AAPL) said it would invest $500 million in the owner of America's only operational rare earths mine. Apple shares rose as well. Shares of medical equipment provider Steris (STE) gained on an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, which pointed to positive developments in its sterilization operations and market trends. Newmont (NEM) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 as the gold miner’s CFO, Karyn Ovelmen, suddenly resigned. Shares of BlackRock (BLK) dropped after the investment manager missed quarterly revenue estimates, even as it posted a record $12.5 trillion in assets under management. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares declined after the bank’s net interest income came in below forecasts, and it lowered its guidance. Oil and gold futures declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. The rally in cryptocurrencies stalled, with prices for most major digital coins lower. TradingView
