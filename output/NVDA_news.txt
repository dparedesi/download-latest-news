This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: ALPENGLOW APPROVED BY SOLANA COMMUNITY: The Solana community voted overwhelmingly in favor of the long-awaited Alpenglow upgrade, bringing the network one step closer to the most significant technical transformation in its history. According to Solana Status on X, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. In total, 52% of the network’s stakers participated in the vote. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana’s existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Alpenglow will overhaul both systems. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming.With approval secured, Solana is now preparing to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. EF TO SELL 10K ETH OVER NEXT FEW WEEKS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) shared in a post on X on Tuesday that it plans to sell 10,000 ETH through centralized exchanges over the next several weeks to support work toward research & development, ecosystem grants and related donations. According to CoinMarketCap, the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X.The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy in June that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multiyear reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making the online casino marketing firm the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. A CHAT WITH BRUCE LIU ON OP_CAT: Without OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as "useful as a jumbo jet without wings" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar. Liu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other layer-1 chains. OP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs. The Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu. "OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. — Sam Reynolds Read more. HOLESKY SUNSET IS COMING AFTER FUSAKA UPGRADE: A fresh slate of Ethereum testnets is replacing Holesky, the once-massive staging ground now set for shutdown after two years of service.The wind-down will occur two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade is finalized later this year, at which point client and infrastructure teams will cease providing support. Fusaka is set to make Ethereum rollups cheaper and faster by spreading out the “data storage work” more evenly across validators. Holesky went live in 2023 to stress-test Ethereum’s proof-of-stake machinery at scale. It quickly became the largest public testnet, providing thousands of validators with a platform to trial upgrades before they were deployed on the mainnet. Major milestones, such as the Dencun and Pectra upgrades — which lowered transaction costs and upgraded validator efficiency, among other features — were run through Holesky first. However, cracks began to appear as the network aged. Holesky encountered “inactivity leaks” after Pectra’s activation in early 2025, a term referring to validators going offline in large numbers, which created a significant backlog for those attempting to exit. The result was months-long queues that made it impractical to test the full validator lifecycle. For developers needing fast feedback loops, Holesky had become more of a roadblock than a tool. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

Ondo Finance launched Wednesday its tokenized equity platform dubbed Ondo Global Markets, offering non-U.S. investors access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on-chain. The tokenized equities, first announced in February, has gone live on Ethereum and are backed by securities held at U.S.-registered broker-dealers, the firm said. The offering includes crypto token versions of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and the QQQ ETF among others. Investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and Latin America can mint and redeem shares around the clock during trading days, with access to underlying exchange liquidity. The service is not available for U.S. users. The tokens are designed to move freely between wallets, exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm has also partnered with BitGo, Ledger, Chainlink and other infrastructure providers to support the rollout. Ondo said it plans to expand the selection to more than 1,000 assets by the end of this year and bring the service to Solana SOL$198.37 and BNB Chain (BNB) with LayerZero-powered interoperability. "We saw stablecoins export the U.S. dollar by bringing it on-chain," said Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance. "Now, Ondo Global Markets is doing the same thing for U.S. securities." The rollout comes as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) gains momentum across crypto markets, with projects bringing treasuries, private credit and now equities onto blockchains pursuing broader access and liquidity. A list of trading platforms and exchanges have introduced tokenized equities in the past few months, including by Robinhood, Gemini, Kraken and several other crypto exchanges. Coinbase and eToro also shared plans to offer stock trading in token form. However, some offerings drew backlash over potential issues such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.

Title: Watch for this signal in Nvidia stock to capitalize on spring-loaded gains ahead
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-trading-strategy-buy-signal-short-ratio-nvda-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T12:40:55Z
Full Content:
It's been a volatile year for shares of Nvidia, with the stock plunging 31% to start the year before rallying 84% since April lows. Sam Pierson, the director of research at S3 Partners, has found a fairly reliable way to capitalize on that volatility. Or rather, a metric to watch within the stock that serves as a signal for outsized gains ahead. It's called the long-to-short ratio, and it's calculated by taking a stock's active long interest and dividing it by short interest. In new research published Tuesday, Pierson found that following notable increases in the ratio, Nvidia's share price has typically surged over the following few months. More specifically, when the ratio climbs to 1.5 standard deviations above its six-month moving average, it's gone up 11% over the following month. That's nearly double the usual average monthly gain of 6%. For the subsequent three-month period, following the signal, Nvidia has returned 28%, versus 19% normally. The stock saw gains 86% of the time in the month following a reading above the 1.5-standard-deviation threshold. When the stock saw rare losses during those periods, it only fell by an average of 1%. These findings led Pierson to call the ratio a "powerful short-to-intermediate-term tool," as it seems to lose its ability to predict returns beyond six months. Here's a chart showing the returns. Periods when the long-to-short ratio is at least at 1.5 are shaded orange. Nvidia's stock returns are shown in the black line. Right now, the measure is below the 1.5 standard-deviation threshold as the ratio of long positions to short positions has fallen in recent weeks to 15.4. The model has continued to be effective so far this year. "In 2025 year-to-date, the LTS extreme signal has remained effective: across 46 threshold days, NVDA delivered an average +7% forward 1M return with a 76% win rate, compared with just +5% on all days, with a 54% win rate," Pierson wrote. He added: "In 2025, periods of Long-to-Short crowding in NVIDIA have coincided with roughly double the baseline 1-month forward return." Nvidia stock has had a rough 10 days after it warned of slowing growth ahead during its quarterly earnings call last week. Since August 26, the stock is down 6.5%. The stock remains a favorite among investors. Brokerage platform Interactive Brokers said Nvidia was the most bought stock over the last five trading days with 234,628 buy orders. "Our customers are certainly a faithful bunch. #1 NVDA brought immense success to many of them, and they are clearly not willing to abandon that name even if some poorly received earnings get in the way," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in an email. He continued: "It was not only the most active stock on our platform, displacing #3 PLTR, last week's surprise leader, but also representing just under 1/3 of all the net purchasing activity among the stocks in this table."

U.S. stocks lost ground on the first trading day of September. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session down 0.7% as the markets returned to action following the extended Labor Day weekend. The Dow slid 0.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.8%. Chip stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) slipping 2% in Monday's session. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The labor market is likely to be in focus during the shortened trading week, with investors looking toward Friday morning's release of an August jobs report that could have major implications for Federal Reserve policymakers deliberating possible interest-rate cuts at their meeting later this month. Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) tumbled 7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, after the packaged food giant announced a plan to separate its North American grocery business from its sauces and spreads unit. The grocery business includes Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, while the larger sauce-focused company will remain the home of Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The announcement of the split-up, which the company expects to close in the second half of 2026, came a decade after the megamerger between Kraft and Heinz created one of the world's largest food companies. Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) cut its adjusted profit guidance, citing tariff impacts and slumping beer demand. The maker of the Modelo and Corona beer brands now anticipates a 2% to 4% decline in beer sales in fiscal 2026 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on consumer spending. Constellation Brands shares sank 6.6% on Tuesday. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, lost 6.3%. Baird analysts raised their price target on Albemarle stock ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting a recovery in lithium prices following capacity cuts by a major producer in China. However, Baird maintained its "underperform" rating on Albemarle stock, citing limited visibility into the dynamics of the lithium market and uncertainty surrounding Chinese government policy. Shares of beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped 8.1%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance to claw back the heavy losses posted Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading. Ahead of the holiday weekend, Barclays analysts raised their price target on Ulta shares, pointing to the cosmetic company's strong second-quarter results as well as positive strategic initiatives under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the reins at Ulta at the beginning of 2025. Biogen (BIIB) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an injectable version of Leqembi, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease produced by the biotech company in collaboration with Japanese pharmaceutical firm Esai. Whereas patients previously needed to travel to an infusion center for a time-consuming process twice per month, Leqembi can be taken at home via a weekly under-the-skin injection. Biogen shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday. Shares of fashion company Ralph Lauren (RL) advanced 4.8% to reach an all-time closing high. The company received a boost last week when a dress made by Ralph Lauren was featured in engagement photos released by the superstar recording artist Taylor Swift.

Title: Why Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks' Slump Is an Opportunity for Investors, UBS Says

Semiconductor stocks are taking a chip out of U.S. indexes to start September—a month that's earned a reputation as the worst for American investors—but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy. "We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas," UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 2%. Tuesday's slide extended losses late last week, amid uncertainty after an appeals court Friday challenged the legality of the Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs, and concerns about America's relations with major trading partners. Treasury yields spiked as bonds sold off, which tends to weigh on the tech sector as higher yields may make growth stocks less attractive. Some investors could also be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks—but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow. UBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector. "Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials," the analysts said.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers

As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: From GPUs to tokens – How Nvidia’s optimism might influence the Crypto AI sector

The Crypto AI sector has not kept pace with the wider altcoin market’s price gains. Nvidia’s fiscal report has projected sustained revenue growth for the next quarter, while tech companies like MongoDB and Pure Storage closed out a bullish week. Can this affect the Crypto AI sector’s sentiment? Nvidia [NVDA] is in the news today after it reported its Q2 fiscal results for the second quarter ended the 27th of July, 2025. Its revenue of $46.7 billion was up 6% from the previous quarter and 56% higher than a year ago. Its outlook for the third quarter remains bullish, with revenue expected to be as high as $54 billion. Referring to the Nvidia GPU architecture, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.” He added that the “NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary” and that the AI race os on. The bullish commentary and the company’s aggressive share repurchase plans could be a sign of greater confidence. That’s not all though as demand hasn’t been slowing down. In fact, the strong growth in the company’s revenue seemed to be in contrast with signs of fatigue in AI-related stocks. Following the fiscal report release earlier in the week, NVDA’s stock saw a 5.95% correction. It fell from Thursday’s high at $184.13 to Friday’s low of $173.17. The generative AI boom in 2022, after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, meant that GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and cloud vendors like Microsoft and Google were big winners. There have been some recent winners too, with Enterprise technology company MongoDB noting a 45.7% rally last week. CEO Dev Ittycheria, speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, said, “You start to see deployments of agents to automate back office, maybe automate sales and marketing, but it’s still not yet kind of full force in the enterprise.” This statement captures the cautious optimism across the market. As far as Crypto AI tokens are concerned, it could take some time for decentralized AI solutions to gain traction. However, when traditional AI players such as NVDA see a hike in bullish sentiment, there will be some impact on the crypto AI sector. Source: TAO/USDT on TradingView At the time of writing, Bittensor [TAO], the biggest crypto AI token by market capitalization, was down 56% from its December high of $748. Bitcoin’s [BTC] performance since April has not been enough to lead TAO token to recovery either. Source: RENDER/USDT on TradingView Similarly, Render [RENDER] has depreciated by 70% from its December high of $11.9. Together, these two tokens highlighted how the AI token market sentiment may be risk-averse. Even though the altcoin market cap, including Ethereum [ETH], has expanded by nearly 60% since April’s lows, the AI sector has only managed 30%. AI tokens come with high risks, but also high rewards for buyers. Their performance would be dependent on the crypto market sentiment, as well as the wider market’s outlook on AI.
