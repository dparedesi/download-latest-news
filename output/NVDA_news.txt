Stock futures are little changed this morning after the major indexes posted big gains to start the week; Nvidia and AMD each showcased new AI-focused products in their respective events at CES on Monday; oil stocks are rising further after leading Monday's rally on hopes that they will benefit from new leadership in Venezuela; Gold and silver are once again approaching record highs amid the geopolitical uncertainty; and high demand for hardware to run AI models continues to boost Micron and other chipmakers. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are mixed Tuesday after the major indexes each gained on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average setting new intraday and closing records. Dow futures were down 0.1% recently, while futures linked to the S&P 500 were hovering near unchanged and Nasdaq futures added 0.2%. WTI crude oil futures were up 0.5% at $58.60 per barrel, trading at their highest levels in a month, as market participants try to gauge the impact of developments in oil-rich Venezuela. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,475 an ounce, while bitcoin was at $93,800, down slightly from yesterday afternoon but still near its highest levels in more than a month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, rose to 4.18% from 4.16% at Monday's close. Investors have a slew of AI updates to digest, after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su each spoke at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. Huang showcased Nvidia's new Rubin chips that will go on sale later this year, focusing on applications in the real world like robotics and self-driving cars. AMD also revealed its newest chips, for use in products like personal computers and servers, as well as physical AI applications like robotics. Shares of Nvidia and AMD, which fell on Monday ahead of the presentations, were up less than 1% in premarket trading. Oil stocks are extending gains this morning after leading the market's rally Monday. Oil and gas companies got a boost from news over the weekend that the U.S. had captured Nicolás Maduro, the president of oil-rich Venezuela. President Donald Trump has said that the U.S. will encourage its oil companies to invest in Venezuela to "fix" its crumbling oil infrastructure and increase oil production. Shares of Chevron (CVX), the only U.S. company that currently has a presence in Venezuela, were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading after leading the Dow with a 5% jump Monday. Oil majors ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), as well as oilfield services companies Baker Hughes (BKR) and SLB (SLB), were also higher this morning after posting solid gains yesterday. The uncertainty created by the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela has also sparked a rally for precious metals as some investors turn to safe-haven assets. Gold futures were up 0.5% recently at $4,475 an ounce, moving toward the record high of around $4,580 set on Dec, 26. Silver futures were up nearly 2% this morning at $78.15 an ounce, approaching the all-time high of about $83 set late last month. Investors frequently turn to gold and other precious metals as stores of value during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals set a number of record highs last year—the price of gold rose 65% in 2025—amid stock market volatility, concerns over tariffs, a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Shares of Micron Technology (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Intel (INTC) are each gaining Tuesday morning as the hardware portion of the AI trade continues to be strong. Micron shares soared some 240% in 2025 as its revenue surged due to high demand for the memory components it sells to other chipmakers such as Nvidia. The demand for hardware to run AI models has also created a shortage in the memory market, driving prices to record highs and further boosting Micron's revenue in recent quarters. Counterpoint Research has forecast that memory prices could rise another 40% through the second quarter of this year, a potential further boon for companies like Micron that could also lead to higher prices for smartphones and computer hardware.

Title: Nvidia unveils open-source AI for autonomous driving, ships in Mercedes-Benz CLA in Q1 2026

Nvidia (NVDA) held its CES 2026 keynote today, and as expected, Jensen Huang dropped a massive amount of news on the autonomous driving front. The biggest takeaway? Nvidia is moving beyond just “perceiving” the road to “reasoning” about it with a new family of open-source models called Alpamayo, which will power new autonomous and driver-assistance features. Starting with Mercedes-Benz as soon as this quarter. Here’s the breakdown of everything Nvidia announced for self-driving technology today. Nvidia is calling this the “ChatGPT moment for physical AI.” The company unveiled Alpamayo, a family of open-source AI models designed to solve the “long tail” problem of autonomous driving, those rare, weird edge cases that usually cause self-driving stacks to disengage or fail. The flagship is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model. Unlike traditional AV stacks that just detect objects and plan a path, Alpamayo uses “chain-of-thought” reasoning. It processes video input and generates a trajectory, but crucially, it also outputs the logic behind its decision. Jensen Huang explained that the model can “think through rare scenarios” and explain its driving decisions. To sweeten the deal for developers, Nvidia is going the open-source route. They are releasing: This is a clear play to become the default “Android of Autonomy” while Tesla continues to keep its Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack completely closed. We’ve been hearing about the Nvidia-Mercedes partnership for years, but today we got a concrete timeline. Huang confirmed that the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first production vehicle to ship with Nvidia’s entire AV stack, including the new Alpamayo reasoning capabilities. While it’s officially launching as a “Level 2+” system, much like Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’, which in reality is a level 2 driver assistance system as it requires attention from the driver at all times, it appears that the goal is to push toward level 4 capabilities. Here’s how Mercedes describes the system right now: With Mercedes-Benz’s MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, driving assistance and navigation merge to create a completely new and safe driving experience. At the press of a button, the vehicle can help navigate through the city streets – from the parking lot to the destination – with advanced SAE-Level 2 assistance. Thanks to Mercedes-Benz’s cooperative steering approach, steering adaptions are possible at any time without deactivating the system. The sensor stack consists of 30 sensors, including 10 cameras, 5 radar sensors and 12 ultrasonic sensors. Powering all this backend training and simulation is Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin platform, the successor to Blackwell. It’s a six-chip AI platform that Nvidia claims is now in full production. While much of this is data-center focused, the “Rubin” GPUs and “Vera” CPUs are what will likely be training the next iterations of Alpamayo that end up in your car. This is a very interesting move from Nvidia. "while Tesla continues to keep its Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack completely closed" who remembers Tesla "all our patents are belong to you" pledge? The fact that Alpamayo outputs a “reasoning trace” is huge for regulators who are terrified of black-box AI models crashing cars without us knowing why. The open-source aspect is also brilliant. By giving away the model and the simulator, Nvidia ensures that startups and other automakers get hooked on their CUDA ecosystem. If you can’t build an autonomous system by yourself (which, let’s be honest, most legacy automakers can’t), you now just grab Alpamayo and run it on Nvidia chips. As for the Mercedes CLA, “Level 2+” that feels like plans to deliver something like Tesla has with FSD without the promise of unsupervised self-driving, something Tesla has consistently failed to deliver despite selling it to its customers since 2016. If Mercedes actually ships a car in Q1 that can have similar capabilities as Tesla’s FSD, and it is based on an open-sourced system that any automaker can buy, it could shake up the industry and start to commoditize this idea of “level 2+” autonomous systems.

January 05, 2026 17:37 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LAS VEGAS, Jan. 05, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES—NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA BlueField®-4 data processor, part of the full-stack NVIDIA BlueField platform, powers NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure for the next frontier of AI. As AI models scale to trillions of parameters and multistep reasoning, they generate vast amounts of context data — represented by a key-value (KV) cache, critical for accuracy, user experience and continuity. A KV cache cannot be stored on GPUs long term, as this would create a bottleneck for real-time inference in multi-agent systems. AI-native applications require a new kind of scalable infrastructure to store and share this data. NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform provides the infrastructure for context memory by extending GPU memory capacity, enabling high-speed sharing across nodes, boosting tokens per seconds by up to 5x and delivering up to 5x greater power efficiency compared with traditional storage. “AI is revolutionizing the entire computing stack — and now, storage,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI is no longer about one-shot chatbots but intelligent collaborators that understand the physical world, reason over long horizons, stay grounded in facts, use tools to do real work, and retain both short- and long-term memory. With BlueField-4, NVIDIA and our software and hardware partners are reinventing the storage stack for the next frontier of AI.” NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform boosts KV cache capacity and accelerates the sharing of context across clusters of rack-scale AI systems, while persistent context for multi-turn AI agents improves responsiveness, increases AI factory throughput and supports efficient scaling of long-context, multi-agent inference. Key capabilities of the NVIDIA BlueField-4-powered platform include: Storage innovators including AIC, Cloudian, DDN, Dell Technologies, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, VAST Data and WEKA are among the first building next-generation AI storage platforms with BlueField-4, which will be available in the second half of 2026.

January 05, 2026 16:49 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LAS VEGAS, Jan. 05, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES—NVIDIA today unveiled the NVIDIA Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools and datasets designed to accelerate the next era of safe, reasoning‑based autonomous vehicle (AV) development. AVs must safely operate across an enormous range of driving conditions. Rare, complex scenarios, often called the “long tail,” remain some of the toughest challenges for autonomous systems to safely master. Traditional AV architectures separate perception and planning, which can limit scalability when new or unusual situations arise. Recent advances in end-to-end learning have made significant progress, but overcoming these long-tail edge cases requires models that can safely reason about cause and effect, especially when situations fall outside a model’s training experience. The Alpamayo family introduces chain-of-thought, reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) models that bring humanlike thinking to AV decision-making. These systems can think through novel or rare scenarios step by step, improving driving capability and explainability — which is critical to scaling trust and safety in intelligent vehicles — and are underpinned by the NVIDIA Halos safety system. “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here — when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Robotaxis are among the first to benefit. Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decisions — it’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.” A Complete, Open Ecosystem for Reasoning‑Based AutonomyAlpamayo integrates three foundational pillars — open models, simulation frameworks and datasets — into a cohesive, open ecosystem that any automotive developer or research team can build upon. Rather than running directly in-vehicle, Alpamayo models serve as large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete AV stacks. At CES, NVIDIA is releasing: Together, these tools enable a self-reinforcing development loop for reasoning-based AV stacks. Broad AV Industry Supports AlpamayoMobility leaders and industry experts, including Lucid, JLR, Uber and Berkeley DeepDrive, are showing interest in Alpamayo to develop reasoning-based AV stacks that will enable level 4 autonomy. “The shift toward physical AI highlights the growing need for AI systems that can reason about real-world behavior, not just process data,” said Kai Stepper, vice president of ADAS and autonomous driving at Lucid Motors. “Advanced simulation environments, rich datasets and reasoning models are important elements of the evolution.” “Open, transparent AI development is essential to advancing autonomous mobility responsibly,” said Thomas Müller, executive director of product engineering at JLR. “By open-sourcing models like Alpamayo, NVIDIA is helping to accelerate innovation across the autonomous driving ecosystem, giving developers and researchers new tools to tackle complex real-world scenarios safely.” “Handling long-tail and unpredictable driving scenarios is one of the defining challenges of autonomy,” said Sarfraz Maredia, global head of autonomous mobility and delivery at Uber. “Alpamayo creates exciting new opportunities for the industry to accelerate physical AI, improve transparency and increase safe level 4 deployments.” “Alpamayo 1 enables vehicles to interpret complex environments, anticipate novel situations and make safe decisions, even in scenarios not previously encountered,” said Owen Chen, senior principal analyst of S&P Global. “The model’s open-source nature accelerates industry-wide innovation, allowing partners to adapt and refine the technology for their unique needs.” “The launch of the Alpamayo portfolio represents a major leap forward for the research community,” said Wei Zhan, codirector of Berkeley DeepDrive. “NVIDIA’s decision to make this openly available is transformative as its access and capabilities will enable us to train at unprecedented scale — giving us the flexibility and resources needed to push autonomous driving into the mainstream.” Beyond Alpamayo, developers can tap into NVIDIA’s rich library of tools and models, including from the NVIDIA Cosmos™ and NVIDIA Omniverse™ platforms. Developers can fine-tune model releases on proprietary fleet data, integrate them into the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion™ architecture built with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor™ accelerated compute, and validate performance in simulation before commercial deployment.

January 05, 2026 13:20 ET | Source: ReelTime Media ReelTime Media Bothell, WA, Jan. 05, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReelTime Media (OTCID:RLTR) today issued its 2025 Year-in-Review, highlighting the Company’s most significant milestone to date: the successful birth, validation, and rapid advancement of its proprietary intelligence platform, Reel Intelligence (“RI”), launched in 2025. RI Reel Intelligence 2025 In less than eight months, Reel Intelligence progressed from concept to a fully operational, production-ready AI platform delivering cinema-quality video, photorealistic imagery, original music and voices, advanced research, and software code generation, within a single, unified intelligence system. RI’s architecture represents a structural evolution in artificial intelligence that materially outperforms centralized AI platforms operated by much larger competitors. Anyone can Try RI Now for free at www.tryrinow.com “2025 was the proof year,” said Barry Henthorn, CEO and CTO of ReelTime Media. “Reel Intelligence demonstrated that world-class AI does not require massive data centers, escalating power costs, or dependence on any single chip manufacturer. RI is self-learning, globally fluent, and improves as the connected world improves, while centralized AI platforms become increasingly expensive and constrained.” 2025 HIGHLIGHTS: FROM LAUNCH TO PROOF Since its introduction in 2025, Reel Intelligence achieved multiple foundational milestones: These accomplishments were achieved without the billions of dollars in capital investment typically required to scale legacy AI platforms. DIRECT MARKET COMPARISONS: WHY RI OUTPERFORMS Throughout 2025, Reel Intelligence demonstrated clear structural advantages relative to AI platforms operated by industry leaders including NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Palantir (PLTR), and Meta (META). Capital EfficiencyCentralized AI leaders require massive and recurring capital expenditures for GPU clusters, facilities, power, and cooling. Reel Intelligence requires no proprietary data centers, enabling RLTR to scale without balance-sheet strain. Hardware IndependenceWhile many AI platforms are tightly coupled to specific GPU supply chains, RI is fully chip-agnostic. As global computing power expands, regardless of manufacturer, RI becomes more capable. Scalability EconomicsCentralized AI systems face rising marginal costs as usage increases. RI’s distributed architecture allows marginal costs to decline as adoption grows. Unified CapabilityCompetitors often deploy AI through fragmented product stacks. RI delivers video, images, music, voice, research, and code through one cohesive intelligence platform. Energy & Environmental AdvantageRI’s distributed model significantly reduces power concentration, cooling requirements, and environmental impact compared to centralized AI infrastructure. Rate of ImprovementLegacy AI platforms depend on hardware refresh and retraining cycles for major gains. RI is self-learning by design, continuously improving as the connected world evolves, without requiring new infrastructure investment. GLOBAL & MULTI-LINGUAL INTELLIGENCE ReelTime Media further reported that during 2025, Reel Intelligence achieved broad cross-lingual capability spanning virtually all major modern and historical languages, enabling use across global markets and disciplines without language-based limitations. Unlike traditional AI platforms optimized for a limited set of modern languages, RI was designed as a self-learning intelligence capable of interpreting, generating, and translating content across diverse linguistic structures and legacy languages. RI’s distributed and self-learning architecture allows its language capabilities to expand continuously without retraining cycles, geographic constraints, or infrastructure rebuilds, making the platform inherently global from inception. As global demand for AI accelerates, Reel Intelligence is positioned for disproportionate long-term opportunity relative to capital-intensive AI incumbents. RI’s distributed, self-learning, multilingual, capital-light architecture aligns with global trends toward efficiency, decentralization, sustainability, and universal accessibility.

Title: Is DFAC ETF Still A Buy After 15% Run?

Investing DFAC returned 15% over the past year but matched the S&P 500 despite charging fees for factor-based tilts. Rising 10-year Treasury yields above 4.2% threaten DFAC’s small-cap holdings while 40% of Russell 2000 stocks remain unprofitable. The fund holds $40B with 16% in NVDA, MSFT and AAPL while maintaining a 0.17% expense ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © bigjom jom / Shutterstock.com The Dimensional U.S. Core Equity 2 ETF (NYSEARCA:DFAC) has delivered a 15% gain over the past year, essentially matching the S&P 500’s return. Investors paid for Dimensional’s factor-based approach and got market performance. DFAC’s 2026 performance will likely depend less on 2025 results and more on what drives 2026 returns. DFAC manages nearly $40 billion using a strategy that tilts toward smaller companies while maintaining mega-cap tech exposure. The fund’s top three holdings are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), representing nearly 16% of assets. Information technology accounts for 26% of the portfolio. This isn’t a pure small-cap fund-it’s a core equity strategy that leans into factor premiums when available but doesn’t abandon the market’s growth engines. Small-cap stocks live and die by interest rates, and 2026 presents a complicated picture. The Federal Reserve has delivered three rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.5% to 3.75%. But longer-term Treasury yields have been climbing, with the 10-year hitting its highest level since September. That’s a problem for DFAC’s small-cap holdings. Small companies often rely on floating-rate debt, so they benefit when short-term rates fall. But rising long-term yields shrink the present value of future earnings, particularly for unprofitable companies. About 40% of Russell 2000 stocks didn’t turn a profit over the past year, according to Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO). DFAC’s factor screens help avoid the worst offenders, but the fund still holds plenty of smaller firms whose valuations depend on optimistic growth assumptions. Watch the 10-year Treasury yield weekly. If it continues climbing above 4.2%, the small-cap tilt that defines DFAC becomes a headwind. If yields stabilize or fall as the Fed continues easing, that same tilt becomes an advantage. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows no rate cut priced in until April 2026 at the earliest. DFAC’s 33% concentration in its top 10 holdings is lower than most broad market funds, but those names still matter. The fund collected $0.39 in dividends per share in 2025, up 9% from 2024. That income comes primarily from large, profitable companies, not speculative small caps. The 0.17% expense ratio and 4% portfolio turnover mean DFAC isn’t churning through positions chasing momentum. Dimensional publishes quarterly fact sheets showing sector weights and top holdings. Check those documents to see whether the fund is increasing or decreasing small-cap exposure. If the team is adding to smaller names, they’re betting on rate cuts and economic resilience. If they’re pulling back, they see risks you should understand. The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEARCA:AVUV) charges 0.25% and manages $17 billion with a more concentrated bet on small-cap value stocks. It doesn’t own NVDA or AAPL. If you believe small-cap value will outperform in 2026, AVUV delivers that thesis more directly than DFAC’s balanced approach. DFAC’s performance in 2026 will likely depend on whether interest rates stabilize and small-cap earnings catch up to large caps. The 10-year Treasury yield and quarterly fact sheets will show whether the fund’s positioning aligns with these market conditions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.
