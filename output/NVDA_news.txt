Stephen Yiu, portfolio manager of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, predicts Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will thrive in 2025 as the next Nvidia'. As Big Tech cuts dependency on a single supplier for artificial intelligence chips, Broadcom stands to gain immensely.Yiu pointed out that although firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia's (NVDA) graphics processing units, they are now creating proprietary AI chips to diversify vendors. "Broadcom is not Nvidia, but we would expect Broadcom to be the next Nvidia in terms of outperformance potential," Yiu said during Wednesday's Pro Talks on CNBC, stressing Broadcom's close relationship with big tech businesses.Driven by Broadcom's AI revenue growth of over 200% to $12.2 billion in 2024, its shares have surged upwards of 126% year-to-date and its market capitalization passed $1 trillion. Under the direction of CEO Hock Tan, the company is developing bespoke artificial intelligence processors for three main cloud computing customersidentified by analysts as Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance. By 2027 each is planned to have one million AI chips in clusters.Still among the top 10 holdings of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, Broadcom shows hope for future expansion in the evolving artificial intelligence scene.

Stocks were mixed on Monday as investors considered the path of interest rates next year after the Fed hinted they would stay higher for longer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) erased early session gains to hug the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 250 points, or 0.6%. Wall Street is coming off an upbeat Friday but a downbeat — and volatile — week, with all three major averages up above 1% Friday but down around 2% for the week. The Fed is playing the part of the Grinch, signaling that it would step back its pace of cutting next year, leading stocks to one of the worst days of the year on Wednesday. On Friday, however, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed further cooling on the inflation front — if still some stickiness. Still, the lone dissenter of the Fed's move to cut last week said she voted against cutting rates because "there is more work to do on inflation." For now, according to the CME FedWatch tool, investors are betting on the Fed holding rates steady next month. For its subsequent meeting in March, bets are about 50-50 on a cut vs. a hold. But this week's light schedule will provide a bit of a breather and a chance for Wall Street to digest and reflect heading into 2025. Markets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, followed by Wednesday's Christmas holiday. Consumer Confidence expectations fell in December to 104.7, versus estimates for 113.2. The reading came in below all 47 estimates, which ranged from 109.3 to 116.00 across 47 estimates, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened mixed to kick off a short trading week as investors assess how the Federal Reserve will handle its interest rate policy next year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose slightly while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%. Consumer Discretionary stocks (XLY) gained while Financials (XLF) and Real Estate (XLRE) lagged in early trading. Individual movers included AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), up more than 1% and 2%, respectively. Wall Street is coming off a volatile a volatile week after Fed chair Jerome Powell hinted the central bank will scale back its pace of interest rate cuts next year.

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Investors’ voracious appetite for all things Nvidia (NVDA) might have cooled slightly of late, but the chill is temporary and the feast itself has only just begun, according to one Wall Street semiconductor analyst. “I think some of these [issues] are growing pains,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi during an episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above, listen below). Shares of the market darling and Dow Jones Industrial Average component are down 5.72% in the past month. The Dow is down modestly in the past month, while the S&P 500 has tacked on a 0.5% gain. Added Arya, “Look at any of these large magnificent whatever stocks. Each one of them has gone through this soul-searching moment periodically.” That soul searching for Nvidia's stock, according to Arya, is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these are company-specific forces,” Arya said of the issues, “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's touted AI chip Blackwell hasn't been a seamless one, Arya explained, which has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” said Arya. Read more: Why Nvidia's Blackwell won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Product of the Year award Blackwell, which was rolled out in March at the company's annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. But bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Nvidia’s issues with mask and system-level configurations may be resolved, but “now we have a period of two quarters where it is very unlike Nvidia to have these question marks and where estimates have not gone up the way they were supposed to,” said Arya. Still, there is plenty of upside to Nvidia's stock long term, contends Arya. Wall Street more broadly would agree — Yahoo Finance data shows 94% of sell-side analysts rate Nvidia's stock at a Buy or Strong Buy. All eyes remain on the company as it makes more strides toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025. From there, “some of these gross margin issues will start resolving by the time the product is shipped for a quarter or two,” said Arya. Once they scale, “they are able to absorb a lot of those upfront costs.” When Blackwell rolls out, it is also expected to boost generative AI to help us go to the next generation, “more easily monetized,” said Arya, who cautions against thinking Nvidia is at its peak now. “It’s like saying the Apple App Store does not work before the App Store has even come on the phone,” he said.

Title: Apple could hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025

Apple’s (AAPL+0.76%) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.” In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.” Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA+1.03%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.65%). Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025. Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year. While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest. Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years. That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said. “We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/22/retire-on-460k-in-2025-with-this-simple-7-fund-portfolio/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Title: The Dow gets hit with a sledgehammer — how worried should you be?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings On big down days for the stock market or prolonged stretches of sell-offs, it's good to have a trusted playbook. Think of it as a guide to keeping your sanity amidst the chaos and, hopefully, your portfolio flush with long-term gains. For me, the sell-off playbook is a twofold exercise honed over years of reporting on business news. First, chat up the smartest people I know in markets and business. What are they doing and saying, and why? Do they sound or look fearful? And two, think deeply on whether something truly has changed in the market or if investors are in a tizzy over splashy headlines. Suffice it to say, I had to dust off this sell-off playbook this week. The end assessment: Relax, folks, this isn't the start of a bear market even though the tape feels punishing. Why, you ask? A lot of the smartest people in the room, so to speak, have valid reasons to stay long on stocks AND the economy isn't falling off a cliff AND we are likely to still get rate cuts in 2025 AND we have a pro-business president in Trump taking office in less than a month. "Big picture, with record earnings, record profit margins, strong productivity, and overall improving consumer and small business sentiment, it is hard to think that this bull market is over," Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told me. Says Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner, "The bull market is still intact, but we are seeing a short-term gut check." A gut check, indeed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average promptly finished Wednesday's session down more than 1,100 points. It rallied slightly on Thursday, but the selling pressure renewed on Friday. The index of 30 well-known stocks such as Salesforce (CRM) and Disney (DIS) is off by almost 4% in December as losing stretches have begun to pile on one another amid renewed uncertainty on rate cuts. The S&P 500 is down 3% this month. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6% in December. What has spooked the markets is the Fed not committing to aggressive rate cutting in 2025. The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China. "I don't see many [economic] red flags. People are cautiously optimistic if they own businesses, whether they're small, medium, or large," San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. But again, nothing I heard from Daly suggested she is concerned about the demand outlook in the US despite inflation being stickier than she and other voting Fed members would like. "The Fed was hawkish but I think people are jumping the gun on assuming rate cuts are over — that’s not what Powell said (plus he just gave markets 100 bps of easing in 2024)," Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told me. "I do think 2025 could start a bit bumpy as Washington may be a bit dysfunctional (as we’re seeing now) and the Fed isn’t as dovish anymore, but I don’t think either are fatal to the bull market unless we see growth start to roll over." Then on the topic of demand, all signs point to an economy continuing to do quite well and supportive of strong earnings growth in 2025. Nike (NKE) called out double-digit percentage e-commerce growth this week for Black Friday on its earnings call. The latest retail sales report was strong. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff tells me he is securing new AI deals at a rapid clip, just weeks after announcing earnings. The AI thesis remains intact and will likely be a key driver of profits and valuation multiples in 2025. "There are strong indicators that this could be a tough year — and, potentially, decade — for the stock market. I’m going to be bold and say we will see the opposite. I have no doubt that AI will drive the stock market in both the short and long term. Countries that lead in AI will see the fastest GDP growth, as well as a significant improvement in standard of living and defense capabilities. And, whoever leads with AI as a company will lead in their industry, regardless of their sector," former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers flagged this week as one of his 2025 predictions. So, while things feel as if they have changed in the market this week, drill down and it looks similar to what has powered the gains in 2024. Nothing lasts forever, and stocks don't go up in a straight line — two phrases to live by in life and in investing.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reaffirmed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a top stock pick for 2025, maintaining its Overweight rating and a price target of $166. Despite some near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in Hopper builds and staggered Blackwell product readiness, Morgan Stanley views these challenges as temporary. By the second half of 2025, the strength of Blackwell will be “the only topic,” the firm’s analysts stressed. Addressing competitive pressures from ASIC solutions, particularly from Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Morgan Stanley believes purchasing trends will favor GPUs over time. “While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year,” analysts noted. The report also highlights Nvidia’s $12 billion annual R&D investments as critical for maintaining its leadership in AI hardware and system-level innovations. Analysts also addressed the concerns over industry challenges, including scaling Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) clusters. While technologists advocate for larger AGI systems, financial backers remain cautious about return on investment (ROI). Nvidia’s innovations, such as Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and NV-Link, are positioned to improve efficiency in this area. Nvidia’s growth drivers—including inference, sovereign AI training, and enterprise applications—account for 70% of its data center revenue. Analysts believe these segments will continue driving growth even amid potential industry consolidation by 2026. “Even with some consolidation in the arms race, we should still see enduring growth potential,” they commented. The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2025 is expected to boost sentiment for Nvidia. Analysts anticipate the messaging will emphasize strong Blackwell demand, albeit with supply constraints. “But by mid year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell which will be the driving force behind revenue in 2h, potentially unlocking more significant upside,” the note concluded. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced an extraordinary rally since the U.S. election, solidifying its status as the market's "narrative king," according to analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC). The electric vehicle (EV) maker's shares have surged approximately 90%, adding about $730 billion to its market capitalization - a feat matched only by a few tech giants like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Barclays notes that this performance is particularly remarkable given the stock's apparent disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has soared from 80x before the election to an elevated 145x based on 2025 consensus EPS estimates. “The decoupling from fundamentals in many ways mirrors the rally we saw from Tesla in 2020-21," analysts led by Dan Levy said in a note. They attribute this rally to the "magnification of Tesla's narrative command," which centers around themes like autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI. Another factor contributing to the surge is the "Tesla-financial complex," where options activity amplifies stock movements. Moreover, retail investor interest remains robust, with 30% of Tesla's outstanding shares held by individual investors, according to Barclays. “Tesla remains the 'OG meme stock,'” the analysts emphasized. Barclays also pointed out the growth of the "Elon premium" in Tesla's valuation. The increased prominence of CEO Elon Musk has elevated interest in the company, translating to heightened enthusiasm for Tesla's stock. Bank of America (BofA) downgraded Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) to Neutral from Buy, citing a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin (GM) outlook for the second and third fiscal quarters. Shares of the chipmaker fell sharply Thursday after delivering disappointing Q2 guidance. Micron projects second-quarter revenue of approximately $7.9 billion, missing both BofA's $8.3 billion estimate and the consensus forecast of $9 billion. The company also expects a Q2 GM of 38.5%, below BofA's 40% estimate and the consensus of 41%. “Data center and HBM trends remain strong but weakness in PC and phone markets are putting downward pressure on memory pricing, especially in NAND,” BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya noted. Persistent pricing challenges in NAND are expected to extend into the third quarter. Although BofA remains optimistic about Micron's position in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and AI markets, it lowered its fiscal 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share estimates by 5% and 11%, respectively, to $6.80 and $8.78. The stock's price target was also cut to $110 from $125. “Historically the stock has struggled to outperform when GM expansion has remained muted, leading to our stock downgrade to Neutral from Buy, even though we still feel positive about MU’s position in the HBM/AI market where TAM was taken up +20% for CY25 to $30bn.” While data center and HBM trends are highlighted as strong, the weakness in PC and phone markets continues to weigh on memory pricing, particularly NAND. BofA does, however, see potential for recovery in these markets in the latter half of 2025. Monness, Crespi, and Hardt downgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Sell from Neutral, setting a 12-month price target of $130, implying over 22% upside from the current levels. The firm raised concerns about Oracle's valuation, rising competition, and aggressive capital expenditure (capex) plans. Oracle shares have climbed 60% year-to-date, largely driven by generative AI enthusiasm, marking their best performance since 1999. However, Monness analysts warned that "valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile." Oracle's recent Q2 earnings highlighted growth challenges, the firm noted. Its FY25 EPS estimate of $6.17 remains unchanged, while its FY25 Cloud Services revenue projection has been revised to $24.9 billion, down from last year’s $25.4 billion forecast. Monness expressed particular concern over Oracle’s “bold capex plans,” with spending expected to double in FY25. "Our current FY:25 capex projection of $14.2 billion represents 24.6% of revenue, up from 13% in FY:24, and well above the 27-year average of 4%," the analysts wrote. They argue this level of expenditure is unsustainable, dragging Oracle’s free cash flow (FCF) margin to an estimated 8% for FY25, far below its historical average of 28%. The firm also pointed to Oracle’s heavily leveraged balance sheet, with $88.6 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 86%. This restricts the company’s ability to boost shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks and limits its capacity for acquisitions or broader organic growth investments. While Oracle has seen early success in generative AI, Monness cautioned that "an inevitable shakeout in the LLM industry" and intensifying competition from major cloud providers could pose significant risks. Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and EV leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year.

"Breakthroughs in generative AI are bringing 3D perception, control, skill planning and intelligence to robots," Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president of omniverse and simulation technology, told CNBC. "Humanoid robots will help close the gap as labor shortages increase around the world, especially in sectors like retail, warehousing and distribution or manufacturing." Some analysts say there's a bigger market for these kinds of robots than for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. And while advancements in autonomy have driven up the share price of stocks such as Tesla, analysts suspect not much value has been priced in for the potential of humanoid robots, creating an opportunity for investors who want to bet on the emerging technology. Adding to the bull case, some think President-elect Donald Trump's expected deportation efforts could be another boon to automated labor. The best use cases are yet to be determined. While the adoption of humanoid robots could pick up rapidly in factories, RBC analyst Tom Narayan sees the big upside coming from when — and if — humanoid robots can be part of a consumer's everyday life. The real opportunity is in "more than just cutting vegetables," he said. "I think the majority of the value [in humanoid robotics] is not on the industrial side. ... It would have to be on the consumer side, like in people's houses — like a personal assistant to help raise your kids or babysit," Narayan said in an interview. "In most manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example, robots are already working. If you look at auto, most of those plants are already largely automated." Predictions already anticipate massive sales, but Wall Street's estimates are wide-ranging: Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas anticipates humanoid robots will be a multidecade, trillion-dollar opportunity largely because the adoption curve could accelerate faster than for autonomous cars on public roads. Far more capital will be pumped into the humanoids given the thousands of repetitive and dangerous human tasks that could be made significantly easier with robots being incorporated into factory lines, warehouses and kitchens, Jonas wrote in a September note to clients. "The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable," Morgan Stanley equity strategists Edward Stanley and Matias Ovrum wrote in a recent note. "The number of catalyst events is on the rise, and we expect U.S. workers to begin being substituted from 2030 onwards." Just a few publicly traded companies are looking to meet this need. Many are electric vehicle makers with AI skills. XPeng, Nvidia, Tesla and Xiaomi are at the forefront and could be major long-term beneficiaries, Morgan Stanley and Goldman analysts said. There's also a slew of hot startups. XPeng, a Chinese auto giant, is poised to capture "the next AI megatrend," according to Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao. The company's AI Technology Day in early November gave investors a peek at how far humanoids have come. Its second-generation humanoid robot Iron is integrated into XPeng's factories and stores and uses XPeng's own chips to operate its more than 60 joints and 200 degrees of freedom with technology shared from its AI vehicles, XPeng said. A leader in humanoid robots, XPeng's first-generation PX5 was released in October 2023. After the event, Hsaio reiterated an overweight rating and raised his price target by $6 to $17, which implies more than 33% potential upside from Friday's close. Shares have fallen more than 14% this year, hurt by China's economic growth struggles and concerns that growing EV competition will pressure auto sales. However, Hsiao said XPeng has a strong vehicle pipeline, established smart driving capabilities, and an enriched ecosystem of humanoids and other products, such as its eVTOL multicopter aircraft. "XPeng shares offer superior risk-reward among major EV start-ups," Hsaio wrote in a Nov. 6 note to clients. "To rival increasing tech entrants, XPeng's investment in embodied AI via autonomous driving and humanoids will be continuous." Xiaomi is another Chinese company that's been tackling humanoid robots, Morgan Stanley said. Its shares have rallied roughly 94% year to date. Xiaomi first announced its CyberOne humanoid in 2022, unveiling a robot that it said was capable of perceiving three-dimensional space and recognizing individuals and expressions in its environment. CyberOne also has characteristics of a human friend — as it is able to recognize dozens of classifications of human emotion, the company said at the time of release. "CyberOne is able to detect happiness, and even comfort the user in times of sadness," it said. The Chinese humanoid industry has received substantial government support that's led the country to produce "some of the most advanced humanoids revealed to date," Morgan Stanley's Jonas said. China — the world's largest car manufacturer and biggest car market — is, by far, also the top robot market in the world, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Policymakers have recently been pushing the technology as a way to further industrialize and grow the country's struggling economy, which is also facing a population crisis. China's Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday that local government officials in China have released robotics policies and unveiled a plan, which will run until 2029, promoting the innovation and deployment of humanoid robots. According to Citi, China has accounted for 78% of all robotics patents over the past two decades. Closer to home, Tesla is a big player with the ear of the incoming Trump administration, which could open the door to more support of the emerging industry and accelerate the company's robotics developments to help it compete with rivals in China. Tesla's ambitions in the space have become one of the biggest talking points behind the company's long-term growth forecasts, particularly as it struggles to sustain its domestic EV market share. "While we see some fundamental headwinds to the core auto business over the near to medium term, we also believe the stock could remain at a higher multiple to reflect the long-term opportunity tied to [full-self driving]/robotics given broader market interest in potential AI beneficiaries," Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a Dec. 3 note to clients. Pockets of Wall Street are still deciding how to value Tesla's grandiose robotics visions. The company first revealed its ambitions to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event. However, its Optimus robots, seen folding laundry in a demo video earlier this year, were criticized for being operated by humans using controls, rather than acting autonomously. CEO Elon Musk hasn't been clear on Optimus' capabilities, but claimed in June that its humanoid robots could eventually boost Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion. Tesla's shares have popped about 46% over the past month, largely because of Musk's close ties with Trump. Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu recently reiterated his buy rating on the stock, saying the incoming administration could drive increased support for Tesla's humanoid robotics. "Beyond attributing the price action to tactical factors, we see potential large terminal value benefits to Tesla's efforts in auto, robotaxi, and even humanoid robotics," Yu wrote in a Nov. 12 note. Yu said the Trump administration could back the development of a supply chain that could support the industrialization of humanoid robots, which he said would need to be produced at a large scale and low cost. That could look similar to the federal support given to the semiconductor industry, he said. Trump's expected hard-line immigration policies could also eventually "lead to a smaller pool of cheap labor, thereby favoring more investment in automation," he added. Many are still in wait-and-see territory, meanwhile. RBC's Narayan is waiting to see how Tesla's humanoid robot efforts will be deployed and applied in the real world and has valued humanoid robots at just $5 of his $313 price target on Tesla stock. He remains bullish on Tesla's progress in autonomy, particularly with its robotaxis and full self-driving technology, which account for most of his valuation. "Tesla ... has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. To me, for humanoid robots to be a big contributor to that, it would be on the consumer side. And I currently don't include that just because I don't know what that looks like," Narayan said. Macquarie and Morgan Stanley remain enthusiastic that Tesla, like XPeng, has its own in-house manufacturing plants for its humanoid robots, which could help cut costs. But Morgan Stanley is similarly holding back on attaching the technology to its Tesla price target, as its $500 bull case on the company values its humanoid business at exactly $0. Nvidia is a clear AI play, but investors are keeping an eye on its expansion into robotics, where the chipmaker focuses on providing the brains behind the robot. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers' bull case on Nvidia predicts that the company's Omniverse robotics business could offer additional upside. Several companies racing to make humanoid robots are using Nvidia's Project GR00T model, which was announced in March. Nvidia also announced a supercomputer called Jetson Thor earlier this year for deploying into humanoid robots. GR00T — or Generalist Robot 00 Technology — is a platform for developing humanoid robotics and includes foundation models, data capture and generation pipelines as well as robot simulation tools, Nvidia's Lebaredian told CNBC. The company is working on several GR00T models, including ones for robot motion, whole-body control and multimodal sensing. Lebaredian said XPeng, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics and Skild are among the humanoid robot makers currently developing on Nvidia's robotics platforms. "Humanoid robots are an ideal general-purpose embodiment because the world is built for humans — stairs, tools, shelving, kitchens, and workcells — and more," Lebaredian said. Sentiment around humanoid robotics appears to agree on one thing: Humanoids could make everyday life easier, and therefore more advanced. "What many people really want is help with mundane tasks, such as cleaning, so they can do more thinking, art, and leisure. AI robots can help with this utopian angle," Rob Garlick, Citi Global Insights head of technology and innovation, said in a note to clients this month. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-sure-broad-103519166.html
Time Published: 2024-12-21T10:35:19Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: A risky corner of the ETF market has boomed this year as YOLO traders chase the rally
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/leveraged-etf-single-stock-etfs-nvidia-microstrategy-nvdl-traders-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-21T09:00:02Z

While the stock market was an early frontier of the gambling craze that gripped America in 2024, investors have driven a boom in a relatively new kind of investment product that can amplify gains — and losses — in a single name. Enter leveraged single-stock exchange-traded funds. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, ETFs have been groundbreaking in offering the characteristics of a mutual fund — owning a basket of diversified stocks — but offering the daily trading liquidity of a single stock. But even after 30 years, the humble ETF is seeing fresh updates that cater to investors with a strong appetite for risk. Instead of owning a basket of stocks, single-stock ETFs track the price of one stock, which the fund will try to juice returns on by levering up. "These are vehicles that mass retail has never had the ability to trade before, until now," Todd Sohn, an ETF specialist at Strategas told Business Insider. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF seeks to deliver double the move of Nvidia's daily price fluctuations. On Friday, Nvidia stock jumped about 2.5% amid a broader market rebound, while shares of the 2x Nvidia ETF returned nearly 5%. Year-to-date, the 2x Nvidia ETF is up 346%, compared to a 170% gain for the stock. "Traders are looking to implement high-conviction ideas through them," Sohn said. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into these funds, making for some highly successful ETF launches in recent months. That 2x Nvidia ETF has attracted more than $5 billion in assets, while other popular leveraged ETFs tracking stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase have each attracted well over $1 billion in assets. That's a big deal for the ETF space, where the breakeven point for most ETF products is around $50 million in assets, according to white-label ETF provider Alpha Architect. Year-to-date, more than 60 ETFs have launched catering to single-stocks, attracting a combined $23 billion in assets, according to data provided by Sohn. While that amounts to relative peanuts in the $10 trillion universe of ETFs, it's still notable, and the funds are seeing a lot of use. "They do pop up quite often on the most traded ETFs list," Sohn said, adding that ETFs linked to Nvidia, Tesla, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy are the most popular. But while they can deliver outsize returns, these investment vehicles are inherently risky, much more so than owning the underlying stock. Sohn said that leveraged ETFs are incredibly volatile, and due to options decay, they're best used as a trading vehicle, "not a set it and forget it vehicle," Sohn said. Options decay refers to the idea that, even if the underlying stock trades sideways, the leveraged ETFs would likely move lower as options expire with zero value and new contracts are purchased. And the leveraged downside tied to these ETFs can be painful. During Nvidia's summer correction, the 2x long Nvidia ETF lost about 63%, prompting concern from Redditors who invested. "Now I've lost a ton on NVDL (not touching my NVDA) and I am trying to think what makes the most sense," a Redditor said in a post on the Nvidia subreddit earlier this year. Another example is MicroStrategy stock, which is down about 33% from its late November peak, while the 2x ETF that tracks the stock is down more than 60% over the same period. The trading craze recalls another popular recent high-risk investment trend—the zero-day option. The contracts are a bet on the single-day move in a stock, with the option expiring the same day a trader buys it. The market took off during the pandemic trading boom, and it got so big that JPMorgan warned last year that its popularity could spark bouts of volatility in the broader market. But for now, the risks appear to be limited to the individual traders who are buying them and not the broader market. "While single-stock leveraged ETFs have gained in popularity this year, they remain relatively small in size. For example, NVDL has $5.5 billion in assets and NVIDIA is a $3 trillion stock," Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at TMX VettaFi, told Business Insider. Going forward, risk-on traders seem less concerned about the risks associated with the single-stock ETFs and more focused on which one will take off next. "The next questions is… what name catches on next with the trading crowd? Palantir seems to be one candidate (and has 2x ETFs out there). But we'll see what else comes up," Sohn said.

Title: Is Under $10 RGTI Stock the Next 2025 NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street’s interest in quantum computing is growing daily, with market participants expecting it to have the same impact as generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the new year. As a result, a $2 billion quantum computing stock Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI has outperformed $3.2 trillion NVIDIA Corporation NVDA this year by a substantial margin (+495.3% vs. +164.7%), leaving the latter lagging in terms of growth. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research This year, NVIDIA’s shares have surged due to an increase in data center graphic processing unit (GPU) sales in the booming AI market. But why have Rigetti Computing’s shares recently skyrocketed, and is it a recommended buy for next year? Let’s see – Unlike traditional computers, quantum mechanics are being used by quantum computers to solve problems at a faster pace. Recently, a potential breakthrough in the quantum computing space by Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL AI division boosted quantum computing stocks including Rigetti Computing. Alphabet claimed that its advanced quantum computing chip, Willow, can reduce errors and pave the way for large-scale quantum computers. Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN recent announcement of its Quantum Embark program, which is designed to help organizations adopt quantum computing as per their needs also propelled quantum computing stocks higher, like Rigetti Computing. Furthermore, the U.S. lawmakers’ initiatives to push for $2.7 billion in funding for quantum computing boded well for the RGTI stock. The market size of global quantum computing is valued at $1.3 billion this year and is expected to witness a CAGR of 32.7% to $5.3 billion by 2029, according to marketsandmarkets. McKinsey estimated the value of the worldwide quantum computing market to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2035 as demand for quantum machine learning and optimization increases. Rigetti Computing is favorably placed to make the most of the growth in the quantum computing space, which should boost its share price. This is because Rigetti Computing empowers developers to use quantum computing resources, establishing its leadership in developing quantum computing systems. Rigetti Computing has already built an easy-to-access Quantum Cloud Services platform that works with traditional computer hardware and offers huge cost savings for clients. Rigetti Computing launched its new Novera quantum processor with 9 qubits, which has witnessed a rise in orders in Singapore. Rigetti Computing plans to deploy its 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system, roll out both modular and non-modular system architecture, and introduce a powerful 336-qubit system soon. Rigetti Computing plans to deploy new chip fabrication to reduce issues related to quantum computing like vulnerability to external factors such as noise. Thus, management expects revenues to grow in 2025 and the following year, after declining this year, a tell-tale sign that its share price is well-poised to scale upward in the near future. With Rigetti Computing shares expected to see much higher levels in the new year, stockholders should hold onto their positions. But new investors should wait and watch. After all, quantum computing is a highly speculative business in its nascent stage. Moreover, being a capital-intensive business, Rigetti Computing faces the risk of running out of cash while scaling up and tackling operational perils. For the time being, RGTI stock possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and it’s premature to predict if it will be the next NVIDIA.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A semiconductor production line, showing the complex procedures of chip manufacture. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the market’s growing AI needs in hardware especially. The company’s growing demand for its data center services and its Blackwell AI chip has ramped up expectations for the coming year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been lagging compared to its record close last month. However, despite that analysts remain bullish on the stock, tying great expectations to its growth potential. On November 21, CFRA Research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino, joined Yahoo Finance where he discussed his thesis on the stock. Zino shared that the stock has enormous cash flow potential, given the demand projections for its Blackwell AI chip and data center services. He also added that the stock has solid financials and will continue to exceed expectations in the coming year. Zino emphasized that investors must not read “too much” into the guidance especially because making a complex technology demands time. Overall, analysts are also bullish on NVDA and their median price target of $175 points to an upside of nearly 35%. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 800 points on Friday, buoyed by inflation data that helped the market rebound from the losses earlier this week. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is regarded as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose a modest 0.1% in November compared to the previous month. On an annual basis, the PCE price index reflected a 2.4% inflation rate — slightly above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%, but notably below analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.5%. The cooler inflation data is expected to ease concerns about persistent price pressures, raising hopes that the Fed may reduce interest rates more than twice in 2025. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 796 points or 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 1.8% each. AI stocks rebounded on Friday morning, emerging as the top-performing stocks. Nvidia (NVDA+1.03%), which experienced a sharp sell-off earlier in the week, climbed 2.3%, trading at $133 per share. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+5.25%) and Broadcom (AVGO+2.98%) were up 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Bitcoin sunk below $92,000 early Friday before recovering some ground on the heels of the Federal Reserve signaling a slowdown in interest rate cuts for 2025. The leading cryptocurrency was hovering around $96,000 on Friday morning, down about 7.7% over the past day. Bitcoin has slumped more than 10% since the start of the week when it hit highs of more than $106,000. – Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia’s (NVDA) Run:AI Deal Isn’t A ‘Killer Acquisition’, says EU

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia just received good news from Europe as The European Commission approved its acquisition of the Israeli firm Run:ai. The acquisition was announced in April but received a setback when European regulators took notice in October and decided to investigate the merger. Almost all tech companies continue to be under heavy scrutiny of late as regulators don’t want a handful of companies to take control of global technological development, especially at a time when a sensitive technology like Artificial Intelligence is in the early stages of development. In this particular case, it was the Italian regulators that flagged the buyout, using what they refer to as a ‘killer acquisition’ card (Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulations). A killer acquisition, according to the commission, is when a large company buys out a smaller company with the intention of shutting down the target company’s innovation or preventing it from becoming a future competitor. This is a complex issue in Europe and one that is likely to be heard more often than before in the future. But for now, Nvidia is safe and can go ahead with the buyout. The investigation was based on whether the acquisition would disrupt the GPU supply and GPU orchestration software market. As things stand, the startup doesn’t have any significant market share in the orchestration software market. An orchestration software plays the same role as the conductor in an orchestra. It helps manage and automate interactions between various components of a data center, including servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and applications that are running on the data center. The commission also noted that customers will still be able to access the services of Run:ai’s competitors. Even though the details of the deal were never made public, a rough estimate of the acquisition cost stands at $700 million. Nvidia will now be able to reduce the number of GPUs needed to complete a task by making multiple workloads run in parallel using Run:AI’s software. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pointed to another rough day on Wall Street Friday after the House of Representatives voted against a Trump-backed spending bill, further increasing the odds of a US government shutdown this weekend. Investors also digested key inflation data that showed a deceleration in price increases during the month of November after the Federal Reserve lowered the number of cuts it expects next year. Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

Title: How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/20/how-nvidia-stock-could-fall-to-65/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T13:19:39Z

The Nvidia Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... [+] United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock fall by about 50% to levels of around $65 in the near term from the roughly $130 level it is at currently? We believe this is a real possibility. Nvidia has seen its business boom, led by the surging demand for its graphics processing units which have emerged as the de facto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications. However, there are multiple risks on the horizon. These include a potential cooling of AI training-related demand, mounting competition, and less attractive valuation multiples assigned by investors, due to slowing growth and less favorable monetary policy. We spell out the key risks for Nvidia in more detail and break down how the stock could fall by over 50% from current levels by looking at three metrics, namely the company’s revenue growth, margins, and price-to-earnings multiple. See our counter scenario on Nvidia Stock upside to $300. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. While AI has been all the rage, quantum computing could be the next big thing. See What’s Driving D-Wave Quantum Stock? and also Palantir Stock: Buy, Sell, Or Hold? Nvidia’s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia’s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, growth is slowly cooling off. Nvidia’s sales expanded by about 122% in the most recent quarter. There remains a possibility that growth could cool further with sales potentially even declining versus current levels in the medium term. Here’s why. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the considerably front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments yet. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see capital spending on GPU chips cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The long-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. To be sure, Nvidia may well remain the leader by far in inferencing as well, but there’s certainly an opening for rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain market share with chips such as AMD’s MI300 chips or Intel’s Gaudi AI accelerators. Nvidia’s top-end chips such as the H100 might be considered as overkill for simpler inference tasks, considering their high power consumption and upfront cost. There are signs that the big supply-demand mismatch seen through the early phase of the generative AI wave is easing. Microsoft which is Nvidia’s largest customer for GPUs, recently indicated that it was no longer supply-constrained for GPUs. The fact that Nvidia’s largest customer has sufficient chips to run its AI efforts suggests that the frantic “fear-of-missing-out” phase of GPU demand may be well behind us. Moreover, if demand stabilizes due to the above factors just as supply catches up, Nvidia may face pricing pressures or slower sales growth particularly if large customers rethink their inventory requirements. Now Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this year (FY’25) to about $129 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 10% over the next two years, due to the factors above, revenue could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to just about $165 billion in FY’27. Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY’19 to about 49% in FY’24 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia’s net income change. However, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are Nvidia’s biggest customers - are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. Competition will make Nvidia’s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. Earlier this month, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. Amazon is also marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that it uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as searching. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business and margins. Should you Sell Nvidia and buy Intel Stock? The gains from NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and potential changes in the AI landscape, what’s the downside for Nvidia stock? If we combine about 1.2x revenue growth (up 20%) between FY’25 and FY’27, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30% from current levels, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by about 15% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 15%, the P/E multiple is bound to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia’s position as a growth stock. Moreover, changes to U.S. monetary policy could also impact high multiple tech stocks to an extent. During its meeting earlier this week, the Central bankers signaled a slower pace of rate cuts ahead. Policymakers reduced the number of quarter-point cuts they expected for 2025, from an average of four back in September to just two presently. This could be a sign that the era of very low interest rates seen through Covid-19 is behind us. If Nvidia’s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 44x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock to about $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3 - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia’s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction.

Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/19/this-is-not-broadcoms-nvidia-moment-yet/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T21:05:23Z
Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Title: Micron stock plummets as weak outlook overshadows AI opportunity

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Micron stock (MU) plummeted more than 16% Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter despite burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence chips. The memory chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) as a major customer, said Wednesday it expects revenue between $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to guide for revenue of $9 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Micron’s outlook points to a trend across the chip industry: Sales of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence are growing quickly, while traditional chip sales slump. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units), which hyperscalers use in data centers to power both their customers' and their own artificial intelligence workloads. Blackwell demand is expected to soar in the upcoming year. CEO of Micron Technology Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement Wednesday that data center revenue, which includes Micron's memory chips used in GPUs, grew to more than 50% of the company's total revenue for the first time in its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 28. Meanwhile, its “consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term." For example, Micron said that while its HBM chips revenue rose more than 50% in the November quarter, revenue from its chips for mobile phones fell 19%. Mehrotra said Micron is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy following its earnings results and outlook. Arya said Micron's growing revenue from sales of its memory chips for AI isn't enough to offset pressures from weak demand for those used in personal computers and smartphones. Analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan, Raymond James, and TD Cowen, also lowered their price targets on the stock but kept their Buy ratings. While Micron said weak demand in the PC market is taking longer than expected to pick up, it pointed to a surging AI market opportunity for its HBM semiconductors used in AI chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Micron said it projects the market for HBM to grow to $30 billion in 2025, up from its prior forecast of $25 billion. The chipmaker sees its own HBM revenue soaring from several hundred million dollars in its fiscal year 2024 to multiple billions of dollars in 2025. “Perhaps what was most surprising is not MU's guidance, but the stock reaction AH [after the market close] given the well-understood weakness in near-term memory pricing,” TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note Thursday. Sankar reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $135. Micron shares stood at $87 at the market close Thursday. For its fiscal first quarter, Micron's earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the expected $1.76, while its revenue of $8.7 billion was in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We reported a few months back how NVIDIA's H100 GPUs, which remain under a strict US export control regime in relation to China, were readily accessible via Super Micro Computer's dealers within the Asian giant. Well, this issue has finally caught the attention of the authorities in the US. U.S. PROBES $NVDA CHIP SMUGGLING TO CHINA: INFORMATION The Commerce Dept has asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips ended up in China despite export restrictions, per The Information. NVIDIA instructed major distributors, including Supermicro and Dell, to conduct spot checks… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 19, 2024 To wit, The Information is now reporting that the US Commerce Department has formally asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips that remain subject to export controls were ending up in China. For its part, NVIDIA has asked its major distributors, including Super Micro Computer and Dell, to conduct spot checks on their regional customers. NVIDIA is particularly concerned as to how some of the end-users in China were purportedly able to forge server serial numbers to circumvent the restrictions imposed under the prevailing US export controls. Back in April, our own search on Baidu had yielded a number of posts, including one which promised a large shipment of NVIDIA's H100 chips "arriving in Hong Kong in two weeks, and can be picked up in Shenzhen or Zhengzhou." Some of the posts also included data sheets bearing Super Micro Computer's logo. Similarly, a post on ZOL at the time also referenced a promotion of H100 chips from Super Micro Computer. The listing on Zol is still easily accessible but whether the GPUs are with the poster cannot be verified. Of course, this development comes as the relation between NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer appear somewhat strained. Digi Times reported back in November that NVIDIA was redirecting some of its orders that were originally placed with SMCI to other suppliers. Similarly, during Super Micro Computer's Q1'25 earnings call, when asked by an analyst as to when Blackwell revenues would start showing up in SMCI's books, the company's CEO Charles Liang had bemoaned that "we are asking NVIDIA every day [for those chips]." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Hindenburg Research had leveled damning allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, detailing a litany of malpractices at the firm. Those allegations had then prompted the firm to delay the filing of its annual report for FY 2024 and the quarterly financial statements for Q1 2025. The Nasdaq exchange then concluded that this inordinate delay was inconsistent with its listing requirements. However, on the 06th of December, Nasdaq accepted Super Micro Computer's plan to regain compliance with the exchange's listing requirements, and granted a reprieve until the 25th of February 2025. Meanwhile, SMCI's relentless share price plunge has been sufficient to push the stock out of the Nasdaq 100 index. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Commerce has recently asked Nvidia to look into how the company's products ended up in China over the past year, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person close to the department. The chip giant has asked big distributors such as Super Micro Computer and Dell Technologies to conduct spot checks of their customers in Southeast Asia, the report said. Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips are embedded in server products made by Super Micro and Dell. The Information reported that five different people involved in smuggling Nvidia chips said they have managed so far to evade detection during recent inspections by Super Micro. "We insist that our customers and partners strictly adhere to all export control restrictions. Any unauthorized deviation of previously-owned products, including any grey market resales, would be a burden on our business, not a benefit," an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed response. Some of the customers duplicated serial numbers of the servers containing Nvidia chips that they purchased from Super Micro and attached them to other servers that they had access to, the report said, citing a person close to Super Micro. In some cases, smugglers even altered the serial numbers in the operating system for the servers, the report said. Dell said the company requires its distributors and resellers to follow all applicable regulations and export controls. The company added that it takes appropriate action "up to and including termination" of its relationship if a partner is not adhering to these obligations. Super Micro said it investigates and takes action against any unauthorized exports or re-exports of its products by third parties. "Supermicro follows all U.S. export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses under the Export Administration Regulations," the company told Reuters. The commerce department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Joe Biden administration has doubled down on its chip crackdown in China. The U.S. broadened a ban on the sale of high-end AI chips to the country last year. Still, several Chinese universities and research institutes procured these Nvidia chips via resellers, a Reuters review of tender documents showed earlier in 2024. Earlier this month, the U.S. curbed semiconductor exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers.

Title: Nvidia stock rebounds after broad market rout as analysts stay bullish on outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
