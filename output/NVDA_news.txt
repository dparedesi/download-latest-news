Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Austin Lyons lays out where he sees the state of A.I. heading as demand sees no sign of slowing down. He believes increased competition in AMD Inc. (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) won't steal much of Nvidia's market share but will open the door to new chipmaking processes.

The rapid explosion in AI in such a short time has caught them by surprise but it's not unreasonable to assume that they can quickly catch up if they choose to focus on the very high performance, AI driven segment of the market. Nvida is a relatively young company that has made it's way with aggressive implementation of a specialized technology. They do not yet have the full range of resources that some of their competition has.

Hopefully this will cut nVidia’s extremely ridiculous prices down within our stratosphere. AMD stock went from about $164 on Oct 3rd to today at $238 AMD deal with OpenAI predict $600 a share maybe in 4 years... 😁 I’ve had 2 ATI Radeon in the past 20 years, and they both failed within a week. I haven’t had one since AMD took it over, but if nVidia won’t drop their prices to a reasonable level, I may have to try again with Radeon. As for motherboards, the last Intel I had was in 1998, when I first got to Japan, since was the only one available at the time. I only build my computers with AMD motherboards and CPUs.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock’s latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company’s history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%. We have analyzed the data. Current Financial Overview It's beneficial if the fundamentals align well. For insights on NVDA, read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock. Below are several important figures. But How Does The Stock Perform During Adverse Conditions? Examining NVIDIA’s past during market downturns reveals that there remains considerable risk despite its advantages. The stock declined close to 85% during the Global Financial Crisis and 68% during the Dot-Com bust. The sell-off in 2018 and the inflation shock each exhibited decreases exceeding 55%, with the latter around 66%. Even the relatively short Covid downturn caused a nearly 38% drop in the stock. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market declines, NVDA is not shielded from significant drops. However, risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions—consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines historically. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's What Traders Expect Intel Stock To Do After Earnings This Week

Intel (INTC) is set to report third-quarter earnings after markets close Thursday, and traders expect the stock to be unusually volatile following the results. Intel shares are expected to move nearly 10% in either direction the day after this week’s earnings report, according to recent options prices. A jump of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put shares at about $42, their highest price since April 2024. Alternately, shares could decline 10% to end the week at just above $32. Intel shares have moved an average of 6.5% after its four most recent earnings reports. In July, the stock dropped more than 8% after it reported an unexpected loss and issued a disappointing third-quarter forecast. The last time Intel shares rose on an earnings report was this time last year, when the company touted “solid progress” on its turnaround plan. Intel's stock has surged in recent months, boosted by optimism about the federal government's stake in the chipmaker and what it means for its troubled foundry business. Expectations for a large post-earnings move likely reflect the stock's recent run-up and uncertainty about how recent investments will affect operations in the near term. Thursday’s report will be Intel’s first since the federal government took an approximately 10% stake in the company. That deal with the Trump administration may have been a turning point for the embattled chipmaker, which has since received additional investments from Japanese venture capital firm SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), with whom Intel will partner on custom hardware. During the post-earnings conference call on Thursday, investors will be hoping for updates from executives on those investments and whether they change the outlook for Intel's struggling foundry business The deals have at least been a lifeline for Intel’s stock, which was treading water until rumors of White House negotiations began to circulate in early August. Intel shares have risen 90% since the start of the year, and all of those gains have come in the last three months. Still, analysts are on the whole skeptical that the stock can maintain its recent momentum. Five of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha have assigned Intel stock a “Hold” rating, while two suggest selling. The average price target of about $30.60 represents nearly 20% downside from Monday's closing level.

Title: S&P 500 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead As Recession Odds Plunge

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of “cockroaches” in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don’t have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.
