Title: Analysts Love Nvidia Heading into Wednesday Earnings

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images With AI bubble talk, markets are swimming in red. However, that’s not stopping analysts from pounding the table over stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) heading into earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Heading into earnings, analysts at Bank of America just reiterated a buy rating on NVDA. Analysts at Rothschild & Co. also reiterated a buy rating on NVDA, raising its target price to $245 from $211 a share. Oppenheimer reiterated an outperform rating with a price target of $265 a share. Citi reiterated a buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $220 from $210. The firm expects NVDA to post sales of $56.8 billion, as compared to analyst expectations for $54.6 billion. Analysts at Barclays just upgraded Gap (NYSE: GPS) to an overweight rating, noting that it sees a brand recovery. “We upgrade GAP shares following a disciplined leadership strategy under CEO Richard Dickson, focused on long-term sales and margin recovery across all brands through product innovation, customer targeting, and marketing excellence,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Just last week, analysts at Jefferies upgraded Gap to a buy rating, with a price target of $30. The firm expects Gap to build on its strong momentum through brand revitalization, which could support both top and bottom-line growth. Analysts at Stifel just reiterated a buy rating on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), with a price target of $508. “Following strong 3Q25 sales, we expect some headwinds for auto sales following the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit. Importantly, we believe TSLA is making strong progress on FSD and Robotaxi, both of which we believe is critical to value creation,” said the firm, as also quoted by CNBC. In addition, Stifel pointed to updates to Tesla’s full self-driving system, with the company planning to add “reasoning capabilities” in newer versions. The firm was also impressed with Tesla’s strong earnings and revenue. In its most recent quarter, Tesla posted revenue of $28.1 billion, which was well above estimates of $26.37 billion.

Title: $1.1T gone! Here’s why the crypto market could see another liquidation cascade
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/1-1t-gone-heres-why-the-crypto-market-could-see-another-liquidation-cascade/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T14:00:46Z
Full Content:
Stocks vs. crypto: Where investors are betting as macro pressure returns? With $1.1 trillion erased and macro volatility returning, the crypto market remains vulnerable to cascading losses. Thin bid support and high leverage risk are tilting investor preference toward stocks, while crypto struggles to find a stable footing. Is the crypto market gearing up for another October-style cascade? From a capital-flow standpoint, that setup isn’t unrealistic. Over the past 41 days, the crypto market has erased $1.1 trillion in total market cap. And still, the market cap is 10% below the levels seen during the October crash. In short, a real market recovery hasn’t kicked in yet. As a result, HODLers’ patience is getting seriously stress-tested. And with macro volatility returning, conditions are tightening fast. So is the market gearing up for another major wipeout before a real recovery begins? The market is so fragile that one bearish move could trigger a cascade. To begin with, the TOTAL Crypto Market Cap has printed back-to-back red candles, reflecting nearly a 20% outflow over the last three days alone. As a result, roughly $1.8 billion has been flushed out of the derivatives market. Notably, 73% of these liquidations came from long positions, totaling $1.3 billion. This, in turn, supports Tom Lee’s recent argument that leverage is eroding investor risk appetite, keeping any meaningful recovery on hold. Source: CryptoQuant Building on that, the data is consistent with what’s happening on-chain. Bitcoin [BTC] reserves have started to rise again, with holdings on CEXs climbing 0.63% over the past three days to 2.395 million BTC. In practical terms, that’s 15k BTC flowing back, roughly $1.4 billion at current prices. Put simply, the crypto market doesn’t have a strong enough bid to absorb more volatility. So the real question is, what happens now that the U.S. government’s reopening brings key economic data back into the mix? The week is packed with a heavy lineup of economic data. Both September and October releases (including the jobs report) are finally set to come out after the shutdown pushed them into backlog. But beyond the macro prints, there’s another major catalyst on deck. Nvidia [NVDA] is set to report earnings, with an implied move of +/- 7.5%, signaling a $345 billion swing in market cap. That’s a huge amount of capital with clear potential to influence flows into the crypto market. Source: TradingView (NVDA/USD) Notably, this divergence is translating into price action. On a quarterly basis, NVDA is still up 1.92%, while BTC is down 16.64%, marking its weakest Q4 since 2019. Zooming in, NVDA closed its last trading day on the 14th of November up 1.77% vs. BTC’s 5.2% dip. Overall, with volatility high, bid support thin, and leverage risk elevated, investors are favoring stocks over crypto. Against this backdrop, as macro pressure builds, another crypto market cascade looks increasingly likely.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla. However, it does highlight that Tesla’s volatile stock is risky amid a potential market pullback. Yup, super Tesla fan Cathy Woods is directing her firm to sell Tesla too. Tesla shares are at least 10x any reasonable valuation. Only gullible retail investors and index funds are propping it up. When it crashes, it will be fast. It currently trades at a 275 price-to-earnings ratio, which is expected to keep rising this quarter, even if the stock continues to drop from its recent high, as earnings are expected to decline further in Q4. Now, this is not financial advice, but I think it’s worth noting that even though Tesla’s stock hasn’t been linked to its fundamentals in a while, its most significant stock price growth occurred during its period of earnings growth. These days, it’s hard to imagine Tesla going back to earnings growth any time soon. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

It was a rough week across Bitcoin mining and broader tech markets. Bitcoin mining stocks sold off alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other large-cap names, and hashprice flirted with cycle lows as bitcoin mining difficulty is still sky high. Against that backdrop, companies faced fires, hardware delays, product launches, and a fresh debate over custodial risk in Bitcoin lending. You are reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube Mining stocks fell sharply this week as part of a wider tech correction. “Everything is just getting absolutely destroyed right now,” Blockspace Founder Will Foxley said on the most recent Mining Pod, pointing out that bitcoin mining stocks have lost $20 billion in their collective market cap since October. (And they lost $8 billion this past Thursday alone). Hashprice is now hovering just above its all time low, which co-host Colin Harper described as “a clear floor for where the average miner is right now in terms of their operating cost.” Hashprice–a measurement of Bitcoin mining revenue–recently tested around $40 per petahash per day, near its all time low, while network difficulty continues to trend higher, according to Luxor’s Hashrate Index. That combination leaves many pure play miners exposed and increases pressure to secure AI or high performance compute tenants to backfill power contracts. At the same time, the podcast hosts warn that phasing out Bitcoin mining too quickly to chase AI could shock revenue and disappoint equity investors. “If you phase it out too quickly, then you just lose a chunk of revenue,” Harper said, arguing that miners need a careful ramp if they want to keep balance sheets and shareholders intact. Bitdeer’s under construction Ohio site suffered an electrical fire that damaged two of 26 planned buildings after welding sparks ignited equipment inside one of the large metal structures. CEO Jihan Wu said on social media that crews were welding on site when sparks flew into the building and caused the blaze, a costly mistake even if insurance covers much of the loss. The fire hit just as Bitdeer reported weak Q3 earnings, missing expectations on revenue and income, and as Wu skipped the earnings call while traveling to an event in Miami. The company also announced a $400 million convertible note, structured with call spreads to limit dilution but still expected to dilute shareholders by 2 to 4 percent. “Down 45 percent over the last five days, just an absolutely brutal drawdown,” Harper said, adding that Tether dropped some 7.7 million shares of Bitdeer from September to October. Bitcoin backed lending app Lava is under fire after a mandatory September update quietly changed how user funds are held. Lava originally launched as a discrete log contract (DLC)-powered lending platform where users locked Bitcoin into a DLC-based multisig, a model that drew users who wanted self custody and programmatic enforcement of loans. The recent app update prompted users to sign a transaction that moved their BTC from the DLC wallet on their phone to institutional cold storage that on chain sleuthing suggests is with Kraken, although Lava has not confirmed the custodian. Harper said users were told they were moving to a “new vault” but not that this vault used a completely different custodial model, calling it “a really bad look” for a sector already scarred by the fallout of last cycle’s leading crypto loan companies, BlockFi and Celsius. “You seem to have needed to move to a custodial cold storage model to lock lower interest rate credit,” Harper said, “but the way in which you went about it completely obliterated trust.” Auradine, one of the few U.S.-based Bitcoin mining hardware makers, announced its next generation TeraFlux miner. The rig can hit 9.8 joules per terahash in eco mode, in line with current generation machines from Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan according to the hosts. At standard settings it delivers around 310 terahash per second, or 240 terahash per second in eco mode, with efficiency closer to 11 joules per terahash when pushed for more hashrate. Auradine plans air cooled, hydro, and immersion variants, matching the current expectation that vendors ship multiple thermal configurations at launch. “I like to see the unit competitive against other manufacturers,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said, adding that broader support for non-Chinese manufacturers would help diversify supply. Private miner NYDIG and its parent Stoneridge continue to scale a vertically integrated mining strategy centered on oil and gas assets. This week, AFE Founder Brandon Davis shared his findings that Stone Ridge is lining up a $2.3 billion dollar acquisition of Eagle Ford, an oil and gas basis in South Texas. The Mining Pod hosts noted that this follows Stone Ridge’s planned purchase of Conoco Phillips assets in Oklahoma, and NYDIG’s pending buy out of Crusoe’s flared gas mining operations. With these moves, Stone Ridge appears to be building a portfolio that combines upstream energy, midstream services, and mining infrastructure under one umbrella. “What Bitcoin mining will survive in the U.S. will be at the energy level,” Harper said, arguing that Stoneridge’s growing oil and gas portfolio gives it a structural edge as other miners scale back. The show closed with a segment on Core Scientific and its key AI client CoreWeave. In a tense CNBC interview, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator framed delays at certain Core Scientific data centers in Texas and Oklahoma as a temporary construction issue and stressed that customer contracts and revenue are only pushed back by about one quarter. Markets were not convinced: CoreWeave shares are down about 50% from recent highs amid concerns that many “neocloud” providers will miss aggressive build timelines.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Title: Nvidia Reports Earnings Next Week. How Big of a Blowout Will It Be?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Monster Ztudio / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, powering data centers and enabling breakthroughs in generative AI. Over the past few years, the company has transformed from a graphics specialist into a tech powerhouse, with its stock surging amid the AI boom. Over the past five years, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates 90% of the time, sometimes by more than 30%, showcasing consistent outperformance. In the last four quarters, however, the chipmaker has averaged a beat of only 6.5%, likely due to analysts getting better at predicting its results. Investors are now laser-focused on Nvidia’s upcoming third-quarter results, set for release after market close on Nov. 19. Expectations run high, with Wall Street forecasting $54.83 billion in revenue and $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share — up 56% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. This pressure mounts as “whisper numbers,” the unofficial higher estimates circulating among traders, suggest Nvidia must deliver an even bigger surprise to avoid disappointing the market. Any miss could trigger a selloff, especially given its role as a bellwether for the broader AI sector. Nvidia’s success in the recent quarter likely stems from its commanding position in the AI ecosystem. As the primary supplier of GPUs for training large language models, the company has capitalized on demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the prior quarter, data center revenue hit record levels, driven by Blackwell chip ramp-ups and partnerships with AI innovators. These factors could push Q3 revenue toward or beyond the guided $54 billion, with analysts projecting 54% growth. On the bottom line, improved margins from economies of scale and software integrations, such as CUDA, may boost adjusted earnings to around $1.25 per share. Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for simulations has gained traction in industries like automotive and robotics, adding diversified revenue streams. Recent wins include expanded deals with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for cloud AI infrastructure, potentially contributing millions in incremental sales. Overall, these tailwinds position Nvidia for another strong showing, reinforcing its market cap lead on the S&P 500. Despite the momentum, setbacks could temper results. Nvidia faces ongoing restrictions on its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China. This “hangover” persists, with no H20 chip revenue in Q3, as CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed, and no expectation for that to change. While the company still sells less advanced tech, such as gaming and automotive chips, to Chinese customers, the loss of high-margin data center business — previously a key growth driver — may cap upside. Analysts estimate this could shave several billion off potential revenue. Additionally, hedge fund manager Michael Burry’s bearish put options on Nvidia, revealed last week, sparked a 7.2% stock drop, signaling concerns over AI hype and valuation risks (Burry just announced he was closing his Scion fund and returning investor funds because he no longer understood AI market valuations). Broader market dynamics, including competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a coming cash crunch, add uncertainty. If demand softens or supply chain issues arise, these could pressure margins and lead to a guidance miss for Q4, where Wall Street expects $61.33 billion in revenue. Nvidia’s earnings next week could indeed be a blowout, given its 90.5% beat rate over the last 21 quarters and robust AI demand. However, smaller recent beats and China restrictions raise the chance of a negative surprise if results fall short of whisper numbers or its guidance disappoints. In the last three earnings announcements in February, May, and August, Nvidia’s stock has briefly declined twice afterward, underscoring potential post-report volatility. Long-term investors might buy before results if they are confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals — which otherwise seem solid — but risk-averse ones might wait for clarity on guidance. The chipmaker’s stock is down 12% from its all-time hit above $212 at the end of October, and its shares have fallen in the past few sessions. CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) just shocked the market with news of a data center partner’s buildout delay and we may see other AI stocks run into similar situations as the race for scarce resources heats up. The prudent choice just might be to take a wait-and-see approach before diving in.
