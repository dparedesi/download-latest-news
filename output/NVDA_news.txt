Title: Why NVIDIA Stock Rose 80% In 6 Months?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/why-nvidia-stock-rose-80-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T12:23:47Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 77.2% change in NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from 4/18/2025 to 10/15/2025 was chiefly motivated by a 48.4% change in the company’s P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let’s first analyze the stock price movements by examining its contributing elements. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet a significantly diversified approach offers great value, such as the one we adopt with Trefis High-Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you like or create a portfolio designed for success across market cycles? Our data illustrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainties into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework produced positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Returning to the “change”: the alterations in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenues, and profit margins have an underlying narrative regarding business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed crucial developments that affected the stock price movement for NVDA stock. Before that, as a brief background: NVDA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive sectors globally, in addition to a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Opinion: We currently consider NVDA stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to understand what drives our current view. Risk: That said, Nvidia isn’t exempt from significant declines. It dropped 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered an even steeper decline of 85% during the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation shock, it declined approximately 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic pulled it down by 56% and 38%, respectively. Even with strong fundamentals, Nvidia’s history indicates it can incur steep losses when market conditions turn. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility linked with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What is the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have historically yielded better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; showcasing a more stable performance as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Time Published: 2025-10-15T16:05:20Z
Full Content:
AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-chipmaking-equipment-giant-asml-q3-results-said-about-ai-demand-china-trade-11830006
Time Published: 2025-10-15T15:55:20Z

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Do you already hold Nvidia stock? You may want to think about retaining it. Are you planning to buy in? This could be your opportunity. Nvidia has emerged the most important semiconductor player in the AI space, driven by its advanced GPU architectures that form the backbone of AI training and inference workloads across industries. The stock has surged 30% this year, and remains up about 90% from its April 2025 lows. Reflect on the following information. While we prefer to buy dips if the fundamentals are strong — for NVDA, see Buy or Sell NVDA Stock — we remain cautious about falling knives. Particularly, it’s essential to determine whether, if conditions worsen and NVDA declines another 20-30% to $126 levels, we could maintain our position in the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during several economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Here are the specifics, but first, as a brief background: NVDA offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, in strategic partnership with Kroger Co. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis Concerned that NVDA may drop significantly further? You might want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks renowned for comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What’s the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment journey, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The major U.S. equities indexes rebounded Tuesday afternoon from earlier losses amid lingering worries about U.S.-China trade tensions. The Dow and S&P 500 were slightly higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was little changed. Intel (INTC) shares dropped to lead losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after a downgrade by Bank of America analysts to "underperform" from "neutral," saying the stock has climbed "too far, too fast" on optimism about recent AI deals. Arista Networks (ANET) shares also fell after Nvidia (NVDA) announced Meta Platforms (META) and Oracle (ORCL) will use its data center switches, increasing competition with those from Arista. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) and other firms tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the prices of digital coins. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) shares gained after the pizza delivery giant posted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates as promotions and demand for its stuffed crust pizza boosted sales. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) also climbed after the financial firm exceeded profit forecasts and boosted its profitability guidance as federal regulators lifted a cap on the bank's growth as punishment for a fake account scandal. Walmart (WMT) shares rose after the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said it is partnering with OpenAI to allow customers to buy goods from Walmart through ChatGPT. Gold prices climbed to notch a fresh high above $4,100 an ounce. Crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen.

Title: Looking for Taylor Swift Returns
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/looking-for-taylor-swift-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:59:28Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedOctober 14, 2025 Legend has it that in November 2004 Taylor Swift was “discovered” in Nashville. A youngster at the time, merely 14 years old, she was playing guitar and singing at the Bluebird Café when a music promoter heard her, took a look, and decided that this gal was going places. And as you surely know, today she’s a huge mega-star. Taylor Swift in Nashville, but no I didn’t see her. Courtesy billboard.com. Well, I was in Nashville too, last week in fact. But sorry to say, I didn’t see Taylor Swift, nor did I discover any future big-time songstresses. Indeed, I didn’t even hit the music scene. Because I was busy. I was on the company clock at a Paradigm Press event at Nashville’s Renaissance Hotel; me, numerous colleagues, a bunch of audiovisual bubbas, and about 800 guests. We all came together to discuss U.S. and global markets, particularly with respect to precious metals, other critical metals, technology, biotech, crypto, macro trends and much more. Many things are booming in the markets, with some offering “Swift” returns just now, if you’ll excuse the pun, and the numbers are eye-popping (see below). So, I’ll leave singing to Taylor Swift and instead discuss a few things that I heard in Nashville about making money. And really; some of the investment ideas from Nashville could possibly go “Taylor Swift” upside on you if things play out. Let’s dig in… I’ll begin with what I heard from a colleague and friend Ray Blanco, our resident tech and biotech guru. How good is Ray? Well, he (humbly) reminded us of how in 2015 he recommended a then-modest chipmaking company called Nvidia (NVDA); yes, that one. When you adjust for splits, Ray’s 2015 entry price was $0.50 per share; and consider that today’s bid/ask for Nvidia is over $188. In other words, in the past decade Ray delivered readers a gain of over 37,500%. And yes, you are reading that number correctly. Which means that Ray has minted more than a few multimillionaires if they held their original shares, or even if they sold off fractions of their holding on the way up. Ray explained how he did it, and it began with a tech conference in Las Vegas in 2015. There, he took a hard look at Nvidia when the company’s brand emphasized its specialized chips for video gaming consoles. Back then, gaming and gamers were kind of a geeky niche market, but Ray discerned that the same processing capability that delivers game-quality video might transfer over to other areas. And this led to his Nvidia recommendation. As events unfolded, it turned out that Nvidia chips could process immensely large data streams. Thus, Nvidia’s chips were particularly useful for crypto mining, and more recently for massive bit-crunching that goes on with artificial intelligence (AI). And so, Nvidia leads the tech charge these days, and boasts a market cap over $4.5 trillion (yes, trillion with a “t”). Hmm… Kind of a Taylor Swift story, when you think about it. Having established his cred, Ray went on to discuss what he has up his sleeve now. The short answer is that Ray sees a massive robot revolution coming to America. Indeed, Ray envisions America’s old Rust Belt transforming into a “Robot Belt.” It’s in the beginning phases and rapidly ramping up big-time as Ray looks out five to ten more years. Ray foresees robots coming to job sites almost everywhere, from office work to stores and warehouses, factories, farms, mines, mills and more. And Ray explained how the rise of robots will dovetail nicely with American demographics, considering the aging Baby Boomers and how the trend is to replace people in jobs that are repetitive and boring if not physically dangerous. In one example of the robotic future, Ray showed an astonishing video of an AI-controlled farm implement that navigates through plowed fields, a self-driving robot-tractor, so to speak. It identifies weeds with advanced optics and zaps them with a laser beam. This beast can work all day, and even at night because of its night-vision capabilities. In essence, this machine – truly a system of systems – will make farming way more efficient, and also eliminate the need for quite a lot of agricultural chemicals currently in use. And absent the agrichemicals, it’ll lead to healthier food in general. Of course, China too is building its own versions of robot workers, factories, etc., and the Chinese are aggressive. So obviously, the U.S. must compete hard to make things work out for our own economy. And along these lines, Ray laid out several investable non-Chinese opportunities in the robot arena. Meanwhile in Nashville, many of us were watching the charts, but not for Taylor Swift’s latest album. No, we were watching as the price of gold popped over $4,000 per ounce, while silver hit the $50 level. Clearly, something is going on. I learned long ago, in geochemistry class at Harvard (back at “that” Harvard, not the current one), that gold and silver atoms don’t change over time. Indeed, elements like gold and silver are formed in stellar supernovae, and to all intent and purpose are immutable. In other words, the metals don’t change, but their rising price reflects the fall in value of our currency, created and controlled by not-so-cosmic forces in Washington, D.C. And then this week, as the newly reinaugurated Columbus Day holiday unfolded, gold broke over $4,100 and silver crossed above $52; and yes, these prices can bounce around, up and down, but the trend is clear: up-up-up for metals and down-down-down for dollars. As I’ve noted many times, the chief driver for rising gold prices over the past three years was buying by central banks that want to de-risk from holding dollars, definitely in a world of mercurial U.S. politics and sanctions. On the silver side, one key driver for rising prices has been global-scale industrial demand, particularly for more and more use in electronics and solar panels. One way or another, these demand forces push against supply, whether it’s new metal out of the mine pits, or from recycling what’s already here. Another angle on this rising trend for precious metal has to do with “paper” gold and silver, namely the worldwide trading system that pretends to sell metal but is actually just an elaborate gambling pit. That is, most precious metal trading has nothing to do with the metal; it’s all about buying or selling a claim on gold and silver bars that never leave the bullion bank. Except that… well, whoops! We currently have a massive imbalance between “paper” metal and the physical version, and this has created pressure within the physical supply chain. People, businesses and even governments are actually doing what’s called “standing for delivery” for precious metal from bullion banks, which in turn must come up with real ounces to wheel out onto the loading dock. With silver, for example, bullion banks have set themselves up with short positions on paper product; i.e., they sold claims on ounces that do not exist. And now, claimants want the metal but it’s not down in the vault. Indeed, we have far more claims via paper silver ounces than there are physical metal ounces available for delivery. And those delivery requests are surging, which is leading to a collapse in inventories. Looking ahead, markets appear to anticipate a breakout of “failures to deliver,” which will wreck confidence in the pricing structure. And thus, we’re on a trend that could lead to $100 an ounce for silver before year-end. This is what happens when markets become overly financialized, when leverage meets absolute scarcity in an environment of “panic.” That is, when just about everybody with a claim shows up at the same time to demand fulfillment on the underlying promise. I could go on with these points, but I want to switch over and discuss the mining side. Gold and silver prices are rising, which is easy to see at a glance. But what about the mining sector? Well, in general share prices for miners lag the rate of rise in the product they produce. Or look at it this way. Mining companies have an asset called an ore deposit in the ground, and they mine rock, process ore, and refine their material into mineral concentrates, if not produce actual gold or silver. And they carefully calculate costs along the way. Let’s say that in 2022, it cost a company $1,500 to mine an ounce of gold, and the metal sold for, say, $2,000 per ounce, a profit of $500. Okay, great. But now in 2025, let’s say that mining that same ounce of gold costs $2,100 (yes, inflation in labor, materials, energy, etc.), but the sales price is $4,100. Well, the profit has quadrupled from $500 to $2,000, or 4x what it was just a couple of years ago. Here’s a chart to help visualize things. Mining has become a cash machine. Courtesy Mr. Uppy on X/Twitter. In other words, miners in general are looking at serious cash flow benefits from gold and silver, not to mention better days ahead for whatever else comes out of the pits associated with precious metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel and much more, depending on the geology. Looking ahead, if mining companies can keep their costs under control, and the price of energy stays reasonable (eg., oil prices don’t explode upwards), we should see superb cash flows and margins across the sector. And that will attract more and more investors who are currently fixated on the tech vaporware bubble. In other words, if you already own miners then good for you. If you don’t own them, you had better get on the train because it’s moving out of the station. Or stated another way… The mining sector is about to go all Taylor Swift on us. There’s more to say, but that’s enough for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.
