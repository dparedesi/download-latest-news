ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Although Advanced Micro Devices increased by 47% over the last month, its counterpart Nvidia could be the preferable option. Continuously assessing alternatives is essential to a robust investment strategy. NVIDIA (NVDA) stock presents outstanding revenue growth during critical periods, higher profitability, and comparatively lower valuation compared to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA might be more advantageous. Investing in a single stock can be precarious, yet there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy we employ with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management - a wealth manager from the Boston area - whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced declines exceeding 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to provide clients with improved returns while minimizing risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a less turbulent investment journey, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 'Non-Productive' Gold Zooms to $30T Market Cap, Leaving Bitcoin, Nvidia, Apple, Google Far Behind
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/17/non-productive-gold-zooms-to-usd30t-market-cap-leaving-bitcoin-nvidia-apple-google-far-behind

Full Content:
Gold (XAU), a traditional store of value but also a "non-productive" asset, has surged to a market capitalization exceeding $30 trillion in 2025, dwarfing digital gold, bitcoin, and U.S.-listed tech giants alike. The yellow metal's price per ounce has surged 66% to a record high of approximately $4,380, with prices rising 13% in October alone, according to TradingView data. This rally has pushed gold's market capitalization to about $30.42 trillion, based on an estimated above-ground global supply of 216,265 metric tonnes, as reported by the World Gold Council. Nvidia (NVDA), arguably the most consequential company globally due to its foundational role in powering the AI revolution, holds a distant second place with a market capitalization of $4.42 trillion. It is followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (Google), silver, Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC$106,789.93, considered digital gold, ranked eighth with a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Gold's premium to tech giants doesn't necessarily reflect a positive outlook for the global economy because it is a non-productive asset. Unlike stocks, bonds, or real estate, gold does not generate dividends, interest, or rent, nor does it contribute directly to economic activity. Its price is directly tied to its appeal as a traditional safe haven and store of value asset as opposed to underlying cash flow or productive output. So, the fact that it trades at a significant premium to the most valuable tech companies is likely a telltale sign of economic malaise. It indicates that investors are seeking refuge in perceived safe havens amid broader economic uncertainty. Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, recently expressed significant concern over the trend of investors viewing gold as a safer asset than the U.S. dollar, calling the yellow metal's record rally as cautionary signal about the U.S. economy's stability. According to analysis, the rally has been catalyzed by fiscal imprudence in the U.S. and across the advanced world, sticky inflation, geopolitical tensions and expectations for the Fed rate cuts. The consensus is for the uptrend to continue. Features that describe gold as a non-productive store of value also apply to bitcoin. However, while gold's price has rallied sharply this year, surging over 60%, bitcoin has gained a more modest 16% in 2025. Industry observers are optimistic that when the gold rally eventually cools, investment funds may rotate into the relatively cheaper digital store of value.

Title: Profit From AI Without The Tech Bubble Risk With Black Stone Minerals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/profit-from-ai-without-the-tech-bubble-risk-with-black-stone-minerals/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T21:51:04Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. If you‚Äôve read any market news lately, you‚Äôve likely seen OpenAI all over the headlines. First, a $100 billion investment from NVIDIA. Then, 5 new data centers through partnerships with Oracle and SoftBank, which are part of a larger $500 billion initiative. The key takeaway? Massive amounts of capital are flowing into the AI race. Of course, AI investments are not new, even if the magnitude of each investment seems to rise with each announcement. The influx of capital begs the question, ‚Äúhow can investors take advantage of the AI race when most technology stocks are already overvalued?‚Äù Finding an AI stock that isn‚Äôt already overvalued is extremely difficult in today‚Äôs market. Difficult, but not impossible. To find value in the industry, one must look at the infrastructure behind AI. Behind the flash and hype sit massive, power-hungry data centers that require enormous amounts of energy. My Long Idea this week is a company that‚Äôs well positioned to benefit from the AI data center driven energy demand. The company has industry leading profitability, multiple development agreements in place, and its stock is cheap, unlike most AI tech stocks. It‚Äôs not news that the ongoing race to build massive, power-hungry, data centers will drive strong energy demand in the coming years. It‚Äôs also not news that most of the stocks involved in AI and related industries have seen their values explode higher. So, my scoop is that I found a great stock that benefits from AI, but it has been overlooked and remains Attractive. This week‚Äôs Long Idea, Black Stone Minerals L.P. (BSM), is well positioned to collect royalties all along the way. I first made Black Stone Minerals a Long Idea in November 2023, and reiterated my bullish opinion on the stock on October 2024. Since my original report, the market has failed to recognize the company‚Äôs strong position to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. My original investment thesis on this company remains intact and increasing AI spending makes future growth prospects even more attractive. Nvidia (NVDA) recently announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help it build data centers to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA‚Äôs systems for OpenAI‚Äôs AI infrastructure. What does a deal this big mean for energy consumption? Brian Sullivan of CNBC notes 10 gigawatts is equal to the power generated by: This partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI is just one of many examples of AI and data centers driving huge energy demand. McKinsey projects that by 2030, worldwide data centers will require $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures just to keep pace with the demand for compute power. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects electricity demand from data centers will more than double by 2030, to ~945 terawatt-hours (TWh), which is slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan. Natural gas is an increasingly attractive power source for two main reasons: reliability and efficiency. Reliability is paramount for data centers, as outages can result in millions of dollars in lost revenue and significant reputational damage. Natural gas offers a safeguard against traditional energy risks including grid instability, intermittent power supply, and extreme weather events. Unlike diesel, which is constrained by limited on-site storage and supply chain vulnerabilities, natural gas is delivered continuously via pipelines, which ensures a steady supply even during extended grid outages. Additionally, natural gas can be quickly turned on and off and has much lower ramp times than solar and wind power. When selecting a power source, efficiency is also very important to keeping costs low and margins in the green. To measure efficiency, one can analyze an energy source‚Äôs capacity factor, which measures the actual energy produced relative to the maximum possible energy that could have been produced if operating at peak capacity. Solar power typically operates at capacity factors between 10% and 25%, while power generated from wind, hydroelectric, coal, and wood sources operate at capacity factors of around 34%, 35%, 43%, and 56%, respectively. Natural gas ‚Äì combined cycle on the other hand has an average capacity factor of 60%, with some uses, such as combined heat and power (CHP) systems fueled by natural gas operating at capacity factors of 80%. The only energy source that operates at a higher capacity factor then CHP natural gas systems is nuclear energy, at 92%. The United States is the largest natural gas producer in the world, and the companies that own stakes in natural gas assets are particularly well-positioned to meet the rising needs of data center power consumption. More specifically, Black Stone Minerals‚Äô management believes ‚Äúgas-powered electrical generation will cause the next 10 to 15 years of the gas market to not be perfect, but more reliable than it‚Äôs been over the past 15 years.‚Äù Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports present another large driver of demand for U.S. natural gas production. LNG provides transportation advantages through the process of liquefying natural gas, which reduces it to 1/600th of its original volume. U.S. LNG exports have nearly quadrupled over the last five years, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. LNG exports will increase 36% from 2024 to 2026. Furthermore, the EIA projects U.S. monthly natural gas production to grow from 112.9 billion cubic foot (Bcf) in December 2024 to 115.1 Bcf in December 2026. See Figure 1. Figure 1: U.S. Monthly Natural Gas Production: 2010 ‚Äì 2026 U.S. weekly oil production has increased from 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in September 2015 to 13.5 million bpd in September 2025. Since October 2023, output has consistently ranged between 13.0 and 13.5 million bpd. See Figure 2. The EIA projects that U.S. oil production will remain stable near these record levels, averaging 13.4 million bpd in 2025 and 13.3 million bpd in 2026. Figure 2: U.S. Oil Production: September 2015 ‚Äì September 2025 Black Stone Minerals holds mineral rights to 20+ million gross acres across 41 states and 60+ productive basins. According to the company‚Äôs September investor presentation, in 2Q25 BSM maintains rights to 11% of the 571 total rigs in the U.S. This exposure is spread across all of the major onshore producing basins, which include Haynesville/Bossier, Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford basins. See Black Stone Minerals‚Äô acreage presence by region in Figure 3. Figure 3: Black Stone Minerals‚Äô Acreage by Major Basin in 2024 Black Stone Minerals‚Äô management team is taking steps to expand its already large asset base to capitalize on growing natural gas production. In May 2025, Black Stone Minerals entered into a development agreement with Revenant Energy for 270,000 gross acres across the company‚Äôs Haynesville/Bossier acreage in the Shelby Through region. Through deal, the annual well commitments escalate over five years from a minimum of 6 wells per year starting in 2026 and scales to a minimum of 25 wells per year. When discussing the agreement on the company‚Äôs 2Q25 earnings call, Black Stone Minerals‚Äô CEO noted ‚Äúthese new developments, coupled with our existing agreements, are expected to more than double our drilling obligations in the area over the next 5 years, providing significant natural gas growth for the partnership.‚Äù The company also finalized an amendment with Aethon Energy which will release over 50,000 gross acres back to Black Stone Minerals in the Shelby Through. These agreements build on the company‚Äôs ongoing Haynesville Expansion (HEX) initiative, which extends development in the Shelby Trough and geologically connects to the Western Haynesville. As part of the HEX, the company‚Äôs Kurth Lake Expansion (KLX) encompasses 220,000 gross acres with an annual well commitment that escalates from a minimum of 1 well per year starting in 2026 to a minimum of 12 wells per year through 2035. To summarize, Black Stone Minerals is adding about 50 wells and 50,000 acres of to boost its natural gas production capacity over the next ten years. As I highlighted in my previous reports, Black Stone Minerals generates revenue by leasing its mineral and royalty interests in oil and gas properties across the U.S. The company does not bear the costs or operational risks associated with drilling or maintaining wells. Instead, it leases its rights to exploration and production (E&P) companies, which assume the associated expenses and risks. This business model allows Black Stone Minerals to benefit from rising natural gas and oil production in a much more stable and predictable manner compared to E&P companies. While profits are down from record 2022 levels, Black Stone Materials continues to generate strong Core Earnings and free cash flow (more on that later). Black Stone Minerals generated $245 million in Core Earnings in the TTM ended 2Q25, which is higher than any other year in my model except 2022 and 2023. Black Stone Minerals has grown revenue by 1% compounded annually and Core Earnings by 7% compounded annually since 2015. See Figure 4. More recently, the company‚Äôs net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin improved from 48% in 2019 to 64% in the TTM, and in turn its return on invested capital (ROIC) improved from 11% to 17% over the same time. Figure 4: Black Stone Minerals‚Äô Revenue and Core Earnings: 2015 ‚Äì TTM Black Stone Minerals‚Äô rising free cash flow (FCF) remains impressive. It gives the company the means to expand production and support an increasing level of capital return to shareholders as highlighted below. The company generated a cumulative $1.9 billion in FCF while paying $1.6 billion in combined distributions ($1.5 billion) and common unit repurchases ($23 million) since 2020. Black Stone Minerals generated a cumulative $2.4 billion (78% of enterprise value) in FCF from 2018 through 2Q25. See Figure 5. Figure 5: Black Stone Minerals‚Äô Free Cash Flow: 2018 ‚Äì 2Q25 Black Stone Minerals reduced its total debt from $399 million in 2019 to $100 million in the TTM. The company earns an Attractive Credit Rating in part because of its reduced debt load and consistent cash flows. Black Stone Minerals earns a Very Attractive rating in four of the five criteria that drive my Credit Ratings. Even if economic conditions deteriorate, the company‚Äôs strong financial footing secures its operations for the foreseeable future. Figure 6: Black Stone Minerals‚Äô Credit Rating Details Black Stone Materials‚Äô superior profitability compared to its peers reflects just how strong the oil and gas royalty business is. Per Figure 7, Black Stone Minerals generates the highest ROIC and NOPAT margin of its peer group. The peer group, detailed in Black Stone Minerals‚Äô proxy statement, includes California Resources (CRC), Gulfport Energy (GPOR), Northern Oil & Gas (NOG), Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY), and more. Figure 7: Black Stone Minerals‚Äô Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Black Stone Minerals has consistently returned capital to shareholders for nearly a decade. The company increased its regular distribution from $0.08/unit in 2Q20 (lows of COVID-19) to $0.30/unit in 3Q25. When annualized, the current regular distribution provides investors a 9.3% yield. From 2020 through 2Q25, Black Stone Minerals paid $1.5 billion (56% of current market cap) in regular distributions. Black Stone Minerals also repurchases units, though in lower amounts relative to distributions. Black Stone Minerals repurchased a total of $23 million in units since 2020. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $150 million remaining in repurchase authorization. Should the company continue repurchasing units at TTM levels moving forward, it would repurchase units worth 0.1% of its current market cap. When combined with distributions, investors could see a yield of 9.4%. Oil prices declined in the first half of 2025 due to weakening global demand amid changes in trade policies and escalating trade tensions, alongside a significant supply increase as OPEC+ members unwound voluntary production cuts and non-OPEC+ producers increased output. The company‚Äôs realized oil and condensate price was $67.07/Bbl in 1H25, compared to $77.35/Bbl in 1H24 and $98.34/Bbl in 1H22. Lower oil prices drove the company‚Äôs oil and condensate sales down 27% YoY in 1H25. Oil prices are forecasted to continue to decline into early 2026, which will continue to put pressure on Black stone Minerals‚Äô oil and condensate sales. However, rising natural gas prices have offset the decline in oil prices. The company‚Äôs realized natural gas price was $3.66/Mcf in 1H25, compared to $2.39/Mcf in 1H24. The increase in prices drove natural gas and NGL sales 33% higher YoY in 1H25. Total revenue in 1H25 increased 2% YoY. Furthermore, natural gas prices are projected to rise going into next year, from $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August 2025 to $4.30 MMBtu in 2026. The good news is even if natural gas prices were to increase less than expected or oil prices were to fall, any downside to profits is already more than priced into Black Stone Minerals‚Äô current stock price. At its current price of $13/share, Black Stone Minerals has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.7, which means the market expects its profits to permanently fall 30% from current levels. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for BSM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: BSM would be worth $13/share today ‚Äì equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals‚Äô NOPAT would fall 3% compounded annually through 2034. For reference Black Stone Minerals has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 2015. If I instead assume: BSM would be worth at least $20/share today ‚Äì a 54% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals‚Äô NOPAT would grow just 1% compounded annually over the next decade. Should Black Stone Minerals grow profits more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares Black Stone Minerals‚Äô historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios.

Title: Why NVIDIA Stock Rose 80% In 6 Months?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/why-nvidia-stock-rose-80-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T12:23:47Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 77.2% change in NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from 4/18/2025 to 10/15/2025 was chiefly motivated by a 48.4% change in the company‚Äôs P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let‚Äôs first analyze the stock price movements by examining its contributing elements. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet a significantly diversified approach offers great value, such as the one we adopt with Trefis High-Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you like or create a portfolio designed for success across market cycles? Our data illustrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainties into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management ‚Äì a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner ‚Äì whose asset allocation framework produced positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Returning to the ‚Äúchange‚Äù: the alterations in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenues, and profit margins have an underlying narrative regarding business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed crucial developments that affected the stock price movement for NVDA stock. Before that, as a brief background: NVDA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive sectors globally, in addition to a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Opinion: We currently consider NVDA stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to understand what drives our current view. Risk: That said, Nvidia isn‚Äôt exempt from significant declines. It dropped 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered an even steeper decline of 85% during the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation shock, it declined approximately 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic pulled it down by 56% and 38%, respectively. Even with strong fundamentals, Nvidia‚Äôs history indicates it can incur steep losses when market conditions turn. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor ‚Äì particularly given the volatility linked with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What is the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have historically yielded better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; showcasing a more stable performance as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal‚Äîthis time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world‚Äôs largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase ‚Äúwill fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.‚Äù The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, ‚Äúwe further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.‚Äù Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to ‚Äúdecline significantly,‚Äù thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen ‚Äúcontinued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.‚Äù U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world‚Äôs leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.
