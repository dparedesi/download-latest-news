ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's Q2 2026 results beat overall expectations, but data center revenue fell short, primarily due to the lack of sales in China.The company's revenue and stock price growth rates are decelerating, with future explosive growth challenged by market saturation and elusive AI investment returns.Re-entry into the Chinese market offers significant revenue upside, but remains subject to geopolitical uncertainties. Nvidia stock fell 1.2% Wednesday after reporting record sales, falling short on data-center revenue, and predicting cooler growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this slight dip represent a buying opportunity? If Nvidia can accelerate revenue growth, its share price will rise. Here are three reasons that may not happen: Nvidia is optimistic about the company’s future. “This year is a record-breaking year,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, reported the Journal. “I expect next year to be a record-breaking year” as well, he added. With the exception of its data center business, Nvidia beat expectations in Q2 2026 and issued slower Q3 growth guidance – still ahead of analyst forecasts. Overall, the chip designer reported “better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%,” according to CNBC. Here are the key numbers: The absence of revenue from China affected Nvidia’s data center results. The company generated $33.8 billion in GPU data center sales – a 1% decline from the first quarter. The company sold $4 billion fewer H20 chips – which are designated for the Chinese market, Nvidia chief financial officer Colleen Kress said in a statement. Nvidia is bullish on its latest GPUs – the Blackwell line. Their revenue increased 17% between the first and second quarters – indicating “demand is extraordinary,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Journal. In May, Nvidia said Blackwell – which accounted for roughly 70% of data center revenue – reached $27 billion in sales, reported CNBC. The company sees tremendous growth ahead. The largest AI companies will spend $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, based on their current level of capital expenditures, and Nvidia could capture “as much as 70% of that revenue,” Huang said, according to the Journal. Will Nvidia’s efforts to revive sales in China succeed? The answer could depend on political considerations. During the quarter, after Huang met with President Donald Trump, Nvidia hinted it may get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. Indeed the president “changed his mind in August and allowed H20 sales to resume after Huang visited the White House and pledged to give the federal government a 15% cut of AI-chip revenue earned in China,” the Journal reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia took $4.5 billion in writedowns because of the lack of sales and said the H20 would have added $8 billion in second-quarter had the company been able to sell them, CNBC noted. Kress told investors Nvidia could generate between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the current quarter if the geopolitical environment permits. Nvidia’s stock price growth depends on the company’s ability to grow faster than investors expect. The company’s growth and stock price have slowed down in parallel. How so? In 2023, Nvidia revenue was up 126%, according to Macrotrends, while the stock soared 230%, noted Google Finance. In 2024, the company’s revenue increased 113% while its stock price rose 194%. In the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased 56% and the stock has risen 29% so far this year. This suggests the stock will keep going up more slowly unless Nvidia can grow much faster. However, if the company resumed growing at 100% a year for the next decade, revenue would soar from $176 billion in the last year to $360 trillion in 2036. Sadly, such growth is impossible unless Nvidia targets new – much larger markets. After all, the global market for semiconductors is around $600 billion – much smaller than the gigantic 2036 revenue figure. Will Nvidia’s data center growth decelerate significantly? The answer depends on whether companies remain as eager as they now appear to be to use AI chatbots. For instance, enterprise technology spending grew 75% to $4.9 trillion in 2024 while large technology companies boosted AI capital expenditures from $245 billion in 2024 to $320 billion in 2025, according to Computerworld. Unfortunately, these capital expenditures have not yielded profits. That’s because 95% of companies surveyed received no return on their AI investment. Only 5% of companies generated returns on AI – which averaged 3.7 times what they invested, noted a report from the MIT NANDA Institute. If the economy contracts due to rising tariff-induced inflation and return on AI remains small, will companies keep spending so much on the technology? If companies cut back on their AI spending, it is only a matter of time before such a slowdown reduces Nvidia’s data center revenue growth even more? Investors see some upside in the stock. Nvidia’s shares could rise about 14% to reach the average price target of $205 per share set by 31 analysts covered by TipRanks. In my view the biggest potential for upside would happen if the Chinese market reopens for Nvidia. Unfortunately, that market could continue to be a political football. Unless Nvidia can find new growth opportunities, the best days of owning its stock may be in the rear view mirror.

Title: Nvidia Stock Falls After Earnings Report: Critical Price Levels to Keep an Eye On

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground Thursday morning even as the AI chipmaker and investor favorite reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates. While the results, released late Wednesday, broadly came in slightly better than expected, sales in the data center segment, which comprise the bulk of the company's revenue, were slightly below Wall Street estimates. The outlook for the current quarter—which excludes sales of H20 chips to China amid uncertainty about whether exports to the country will resume—also disappointed some investors. Market participants have come to expect that Nvidia's results and guidance will always blow past expectations. Nvidia shares were down 1.5% at around $179 in midday trading. Coming into today's session the stock had gained 35% since the start of the year, making it the biggest gainer among members of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap technology stocks, amid booming demand from major companies building their AI infrastructure. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and use technical analysis to point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After registering a fresh all-time high earlier this month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways, indicating apprehension among market participants ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results. While the relative strength index remained in bullish territory leading into earnings, the indicator had made consistently lower highs since topping out in mid-July, signaling weakening buying momentum. Let’s identify key support levels to watch and point out an important overhead area worth eyeing if the stock rallies. Initial earnings-driven selling could see the shares test key support around $174. This area may attract buying interest near the mid-July peak and a minor retracement in the stock last week. A close below this location may lead to a retest of support at the $159 level. Investors could look for entry points in this area near the June high, which preceded a brief two-day dip before the stock resumed its uptrend. Further selling opens the door for a decline to the key $150 level. The shares would likely encounter support in this region never multiple peaks that formed on the chart between November and January. Interestingly, this level closely aligns with a downside bars pattern target that takes the move lower following the chipmaker’s 2024 third-quarter earnings report and repositions it from the stock’s recent highs. This analysis provides clues as to how a similar post-earnings profit-taking phase may unfold. If Nvidia shares resume their longer-term move higher, investors should eye the $183 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s recent trading levels just below the record high.

Title: Why Wall Street is boosting forecasts for Nvidia stock even higher after a lukewarm reaction to earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-nvda-outlook-wall-street-forecast-q2-earnings-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-28T15:14:18Z

For a company like Nvidia, which is used to blowing the doors off earnings reports, Wednesday wasn't the best day. While the chipmaking giant beat second-quarter revenue and earnings, the vibes were lukewarm at best, and the move in the stock price showed it. Shares quickly slid as much as 4% in the after-market before recovering a bit. They remained about 1% lower in regular Thursday trading. But if there's anything to worry about, analysts are shrugging it off. The broad consensus across Wall Street is that Nvidia's earnings report was good enough to unlock further stock upside in the future. Below is a sampling of this bullish push — five banks that raised their price targets in the immediate aftermath of Nvidia earnings, and why they did so. Rating: Overweight New price target: $215 (up from $170) Reasoning: JPMorgan sees enough demand for Nvidia's Blackwell products to support the company's revenue guidance of $54 billion for the following quarter. Demand for Nvidia's H20 chip, meanwhile, could provide as much as $2 billion to $5 billion in extra revenue for the following quarter, analysts estimated, despite uncertainty surrounding US trade restrictions with China. "Overall, we believe NVIDIA's 12-month forward order book continues to outstrip supply," the bank wrote in a client note. "All in, the playbook remains the same here for NVDA - a solid beat and raise with multiple levers at play to drive upside, against the backdrop of a multi-year runway of growth for AI infrastructure spending, with NVDA in our view continuing to capture a significant majority of the incremental spend," it added. Rating: Neutral New price target: $195 (up from $135) Reasoning: DA Davidson, which once said it believed 2025 would be a "peak year" in the AI cycle, said it no longer believed that to be the case. "While we are maintaining our Neutral rating we would like to highlight our perspective on NVDA has shifted quite a bit over the last 6 months," analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. "We now believe demand growth for inference will sustain for the foreseeable future," it added, pointing to progress made on AI models over the last year. Rating: Buy New price target: $240 (up from $235) Reasoning: The research firm highlighted Jensen Huang's comments on Nvidia's earnings call, where the CEO estimated that capex on data centers could boom to around $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The chipmaker also said it saw a $2 trillion total addressable market in the computing and networking business. That could "portend to big numbers" for Nvidia, Melius added, reiterating its forecast that the company's annual revenue could surpass $600 billion by the end of the decade. "People will regret focusing on the near-term," analysts wrote on Thursday. "We reiterate our Buy rating and are still excited about Sovereign and hyperscaler demand driving upside for multiple years," the firm added, though it noted it was taking out China as part of its estimates for the firm going forward. Rating: Buy New price target: $228 (up from $210) Reasoning: Nvidia still has "significant growth potential," Truist analysts wrote, despite the firm's latest guidance falling slightly below expectations. "We recognize this as a minor imperfection, and instead focus on management's resilient longer-term outlook," the firm said in a note on Wednesday. The firm highlighted 3 catalysts that could take Nvidia higher over the long run: "NVDA remains *the* AI company. Buy," the note added. Rating: Overweight New price target: $210 (up from $206) Reasoning: Nvidia handily "cleared the bar" with its second-quarter results, despite doubts looming over China, Morgan Stanley said. In a note to clients, analysts said they believed Nvidia's earnings-per-share valuation was still supported by improving gross profit margins and demand growth for its products, like the company's Blackwell ramp. Nvidia also remains on track to launch its Rubin chip next year, and demand for AI computing is still growing, analysts noted. "Nvidia has a tendency to rerate quickly when there is a wall of worry to climb; we don't have that today," analysts wrote in a note. "It's easier to make the case for upside when there is a fundamental overhang on the stock, but even without one the financial profile of mid 50s+ % y/y growth in revenue with >60% operating margins will remain attractive as long as beats and raises continue - where our confidence remains high."

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Did Nvidia Just Pop an AI Bubble? Here’s What the Market Says

Lukewarm second quarter results from AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) Wednesday have Wall Street bros and the analysts that love them catching all kinds of feelings. Long a bellwether for how the market views AI in general, the largest company in the world carries enough weight in its $1 trillion valuation to move entire indexes, let alone the tech sector. That was especially the case over the last two weeks, when handwringing over what Nvidia would say in its second quarter results on Aug. 27 reached a fever pitch. The TLDR take on what all that was and why it matters? Numbers that showed strong growth from Nvidia were good for AI’s continued bull run; weak numbers would mean that the casino-level spending on AI is finally showing signs of a slowdown. With investors like the U.S. government and Meta, Google, and the private market plowing billions into AI and its tools, it’s always wise to pause for a minute and see what the short-term projections may be for such a hot sector. Well, as is usually the case with analyzing Wall Street, that really depends on who you ask. Overall, Nvidia managed to surpass market consensus, with reported Q2 sales of $46.74 billion, up 56% from a year ago, a number that eked past the market’s projected consensus of $46.23 billion. Of that number, roughly $41.1 billion was from the company’s data centers business, which missed its expected target of $41.29 billion. For some tech sector watchers, that disparity (while considered relatively minor in other businesses) was enough to raise alarm bells that a spending Ice Age could be drawing nigh. “[Data center operator spending] could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne wrote in a note to investors. To others, however, Nvidia’s results were actually a reassuring sign that AI spending and the investors, banks, and VCs funding it have very little to fear from these particular results. “I don’t care about the seemingly sky-high market capitalization that these stocks have. I’m simply trying to put a valuation on a company that makes what you need to become one of the serious players in AI,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said after parsing earnings. “I learned not to question Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Meta or even Tesla — the big customers — a long time ago. They know more than I do … I’m just grateful they let me along for the ride,” Cramer added. Of course, debate about the bubble wasted no time flourishing across social media Wednesday, with boosters and doubters posting everything from super-long treatises to hot take memes on how close to calamity or calm we are now. just listened to two moms at the playground saying they want to look into starting an “ai dentistry” practice. guys it’s a bubble it’s a bubble pic.twitter.com/oAEbqjddrc — bwabbage (@bwabbage) August 27, 2025 Is it good at NVIDIA missed data center revenue estimates two quarters running?

Nobody wanted to talk about this last quarter, wonder if they’ll pretend again this one [image or embed] — Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com) August 27, 2025 at 4:32 PM Nvidia delivered more revenue than expected over the recent three-month period ending in July, the company said on Wednesday, defying concern among some prominent figures about a possible bubble in the AI industry. https://t.co/yuXPMcqSMY — ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2025 It’s probably best to hedge your bets on AI as a never-ending juggernaut of growth. With data center and growths numbers like the ones posted Wednesday, the outlook surrounding Nvidia’s earnings has heightened fears that the current surge in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be unsustainable in the long run. You can now expect a growing chorus of analysts to question whether valuations are justified by actual revenue potential, especially amid broader economic uncertainties. Nvidia’s outlook for its business in China was also a key part of its Q2 guidance and highlighted two potentially major hurdles to growth: Disappointing numbers reported from that region, and a continuing uncertainty on what it might expect from American domestic policies. Specifically worrisome is that, despite the Trump administration recently easing restrictions on exports of certain AI chips to Beijing, this policy shift has yet to produce a meaningful recovery in Nvidia’s revenue from the region. The lingering difficulties in the Chinese market also continue to cast a shadow over the company’s growth prospects, highlighting how geopolitical tensions remain a significant headwind for the semiconductor giant. artificial intellienceemerging technologiesNvidia Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: 5 biggest takeaways from the Nvidia Q2 earnings call

Nvidia exceeded expectations once again in its second quarter of 2025, but China remains a question mark. On Wednesday, the chipmaking giant reported $46.74 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both beating analyst estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter sales of about $54 billion. Despite the upbeat earnings, Nvidia shares slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of forecasts for a second straight quarter, and as signs of slowing growth began to show. From the uncertainties around the H20 chips' shipment to China to the spending on AI infrastructure, here are the main takeaways from the chipmaking giant's earnings call. Colette Kress, the chief financial officer, said Nvidia has yet to ship any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers recently receiving licenses. On the earnings call, she said that shipments worth $2 billion to $5 billion could flow if restrictions ease, but the company has excluded that revenue from its third-quarter forecast. The company has also floated a 15% remittance to the US government on licensed sales, though no rule has been finalized. "We just have to keep advocating," CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," Huang added. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. Nvidia projected its Q3 revenue at $54 billion with a 2% margin, exceeding analysts' expectations of $53.4 billion. However, the company said its projections didn't include H20 sales to China, which are still uncertain. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told BI that he sees some parallels between Nvidia's current shares and times when Tesla would have strong financials but slowing guidance, which slows the growth in share prices. "Now NVDA is 'only' growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100%+ revenue growth from last year," said Mulberry. "As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock." Nvidia expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, said Kress. The CFO called it a "significant long-term growth opportunity." Her comments come as Big Tech ramps up spending in AI and fuels GDP growth, though some tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned that some investors may be overhyping the sector. Earlier this week, JPMorgan wrote in a note that the high capex spending points to strong growth forecasts in AI. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending," the bank wrote. "This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries." The build-out of AI models has powered Nvidia's growth in the last several years. Now comes robotics. "Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform," Kress said during the call. Robotics remains a small part of Nvidia's business, but Huang and Kress said they're seeing signs of growth. Jetson AGX Thor, Nvidia's latest robotics computing platform or "robot brain," was released earlier this week. Kress said the adoption of Thor "is growing at rapid rate," with more than 2 million developers taking the platform to market. The CFO also said automotive revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $586 million, primarily thanks to self-driving cars. Kress said Nvidia's successor to its popular Blackwell chip architecture, Rubin, is on track for volume production in 2026, giving investors the innovation, predictable product cycle, and revenue generator they like to see. While the earnings call didn't provide many details around the next-generation chip, Kress said the chips are "in fab," meaning that the manufacturing process has begun. "This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software," Kress said. Jump to

(Reuters) - AI chipmaker Nvidia, the dominating force behind the U.S. stock market rally since 2023, forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday. Helped by robust demand for its artificial intelligence chips from cloud providers expanding infrastructure to power generative AI technology, Nvidia expects revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter. That compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.14 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Shares of the world's most valuable firm were down 2.4% in extended trading, paring a knee-jerk loss after the report. NVDA gained more than a third so far in 2025 to outpace the benchmark S&P 500 Index's year-to-date rise of nearly 10%. COMMENTS: THOMAS MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA GEORGIA "The overall AI trade is still very much intact. Nvidia said demand is just really, really high. So to the extent that you believe that, the AI trade is still at the very early stages." "There's nothing really to suggest that the AI trade is over. When you have something that is new, and it's growing as fast as it is, and all of the huge capex announcements from the hyperscalers, it's evidence that we're in the early stages. there's no reason that I can see that you want to sell this off to any great degree." WILL RHIND, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRANITESHARES "The market has gotten so used to NVIDIA delivering blowout earnings and data center growth that anything short of that feels like a disappointment. The modest miss on data center revenue is more a reminder that those huge growth rates are going to slow eventually." BRIAN MULBERRY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "It is double beat on top and bottom line including the $8 billion China cost. After hours even with this strong outperformance the stock is down more than 3% - a signal that the rate of growth is slowing and that causes price momentum to slow in the shares. "We saw this with Tesla at times when they would have strong financials but guidance was slowing as capacity was meeting demand which ultimately slows the rate of growth. Now NVDA is “only” growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100% revenue growth from last year. As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock. "Manufacturing operations seem to be growing at a pace that forward guidance should be easily intact going forward. It looks like they stated the China impact (opportunity costs) of $8 billion which is right on target with Jensen’s previous public statements and in line with Wall Street expectations." DAVID WAGNER, HEAD OF EQUITY, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS "The negative stock reaction feels like a bit of an incorrect knee-jerk reaction - the company is still growing over 50% on their guidance at a $50B quarterly revenue run rate - that's remarkable, even for the current valuation. I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue. I want to be buying the pullback as I am sure management will weave a bullish demand story on the conference call." NICK FRASSE, PRODUCT MANAGER, VANECK ASSOCIATES, NEW YORK “My takeaway is that these numbers are not unexpected, nor is this reaction. The market has begun to factor in that Nvidia can continue to beat most expectations in spite of headwinds and questions like what they will have to pay to continue selling to China. Their earnings beats and growth in EPS have become more normalized as investors understand their business model better. In the early stages of all this excitement, they had crazy beats that seemed to come out of nowhere; no one then had expected a gaming company to have this amazing AI pivot. Now we look at their business model and see that they don’t have the capital spending drag that vertically integrated companies do, but they’re benefiting from all the money that the hyperscalers clearly continue to keep spending on AI. "We launched the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF exactly a year ago today, and Nvidia is its largest holding at 20.67% of the fund right now. These results give us confidence that the hyperscalers are not slowing down, and that it’s getting to the point now where as the Magnificent 7 companies continue to grow, it’s all compounding in their favor. This technology is allowing them to drive revenue higher – and then to spend more of that revenue on more technology.” MATT ORTON, HEAD OF ADVISORY SOLUTIONS, RAYMOND JAMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TAMPA BAY AREA "I think it should be a positive read-through eventually, after the dust settles, to the rest of the AI trade, and the fact that there's still a tremendous amount of growth that's happening." "For Nvidia, it's more of just calibration of expectations, but the fact that you saw such strong growth, particularly across the data centers, and just the absolute numbers that are associated with the revenues that are coming in, I think all of that is a sign that there is still a lot of room to run with respect to the AI capex story." "The mega caps are the ones propelling a lot of the capex that Nvidia is benefiting from. But obviously Nvidia still is growing, is able to sell. If anything, this just highlights that there's a lot of durability to this (AI) trade, and that, I think that the businesses of these hyperscalers can continue to accelerate, and you're not seeing any sort of signs of a slowdown being reflected in the results of Nvidia." "The results from Nvidia will just reaffirm the fact that we're not in an AI bubble." DIMITRI ZABELIN, SENIOR ANALYST, AI, PITCHBOOK, SAN FRANCISCO, CA "Since the onset of the AI boom in late 2022, the company has largely beaten forecasts, propelled by explosive growth in its data center division. "As U.S. hyperscaler demand continues to expand, Nvidia is diversifying by turning to sovereign buyers to anchor the next wave of adoption, positioning national governments as strategic clients for its hardware. "PitchBook’s comp sheet analysis also shows hyperscalers and AI infrastructure leaders outperforming benchmarks, underscoring durable demand for compute hardware as governments and enterprises step up procurement." LARRY TENTARELLI, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, BLUE CHIP DAILY TREND REPORT "In the very short-term, the stock is seeing some downside testing, as they did not drastically exceed the consensus forecasts. Beyond the short-term volatility, Nvidia remains the benchmark Artificial Intelligence stock and the most direct way to invest in the theme. "The AI trade has been the major driver of this bull market over the past 30 months and we expect that both AI and Nvidia will continue to lead. "CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on the conference call will be closely monitored by markets, but barring any slowdown comments from Huang, we would be buyers of Nvidia on any near-term weakness. In our view, this is the dominant AI market leader to own." CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA The results "were okay. They weren't blow-the-doors-off, but nor were they bad. And I think the stock price movement is going to depend a lot on what they say on the earnings call, especially if they give color on China." "I think people were a little disappointed in the data center number, which looks like the sequential growth was about 5% ... and I think people might have been looking for a little bit more on that side." "I'm not surprised that the stock in the after-market is down a bit, but it is not down a ton, especially given the strength that the stock is showing so far this year."

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Pull Just Ahead of Estimates

Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly earnings just slightly ahead of Wall Street analysts' expectations, as its sales rose to a record high. The AI chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue that soared 56% year-over-year to a record $46.74 billion in the second quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. (Investopedia's live coverage of the results is here.) Nvidia said its profits benefited from the release of $180 million tied to sales of inventory of its H20 chips, which were banned in China during the quarter by the Trump administration's export controls, to a customer outside China. The chipmaker said that without its sales of previously reserved H20 chips outside of China, it would have reported EPS of $1.04. Data center sales, which make up the bulk of Nvidia's revenue, climbed to a record $41.1 billion, though that figure slightly missed Street projections. Several of Nvidia’s Big Tech customers have committed to big spending plans to build out their AI capacity in recent earnings calls, fueling analysts' lofty expectations, which climbed ahead of Wednesday's report. The chipmaker said its board also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Nvidia shares declined about 3% in after-hours trading. The stock added more than a third of its value in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. Looking ahead, Nvidia projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, which would be another record high. Wall Street analysts had called for revenue of $53.8 billion. However, that forecast doesn't take into account potential H20 sales to China, which could resume, thanks to a recent 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration. Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while it waits for the U.S. government to codify its revenue-sharing agreement. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company’s earnings call that he estimates China's market could represent a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. The CEO also said he sees a "real possibility" Nvidia could be granted a license to sell its Blackwell chips (which are more powerful than H20) in China, as the company continues talks with the Trump administration about expanding its access to the region.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Wednesday as investors anticipated the release of a quarterly update from semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) after the closing bell. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%, sending the benchmark index to another all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also up 0.2%, while the blue-chip Dow closed Wednesday's session 0.3% higher. Recap Investopedia's coverage of today's trading here. Nvidia shares, which are up about 35% this year so far to lead the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks, were about flat in the regular session. Detailed coverage of its earnings is available here. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, jumped 7.5% to secure the S&P 500's top daily performance. The move higher came a day after UBS upgraded Albemarle to "neutral" from "sell" and lifted its price target on the stock. Analysts cited an improving outlook for lithium prices in 2026 following recent production cutbacks in China. Albemarle and other lithium producers have been cutting costs and scaling back expansion plans as they navigate a prolonged slump in the price of the key battery component. An upgrade from UBS also helped shares of casino operators. Analysts at the firm raised their view on Wynn Macau, a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) operating in the Asian gaming hotspot, to "buy" from "neutral." UBS highlighted improved growth forecasts for Macau's gross gaming revenue and suggested that high-end operators like Wynn are likely to sustain or increase their market share in the special administrative region. Wynn Resorts shares gained 3.5%, while shares of fellow Macau-exposed gaming companies MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) were also up more than 3%. Database software firm MongoDB (MDB) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter and increased its full-year outlook, and its shares skyrocketed roughly 38%. Strong customer additions and subscription revenue growth underpinned the company's performance. The report helped boost the shares of other database software firms, including those of service analytics specialist Datadog (DDOG), which advanced 4.3%. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares dropped 6.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock has seen significant volatility since the completion of the merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global earlier this month. The latest move lower came after Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on Paramount Skydance stock, citing a steep valuation and muted growth expectations for adjusted operating income. BofA Securities analysts downgraded SBA Communications (SBAC) to "neutral" from "buy" and cut their price target on shares of the wireless infrastructure real estate investment trust. The downgrade came after DISH TV operator EchoStar (SATS) said that it sold 50 megahertz of its nationwide low- and mid-band spectrum allocations to AT&T (T). Analysts believe the move suggests that AT&T could scale back its network densification efforts, which would have a negative impact on SBAC's business. SBAC shares lost 4.9% on Wednesday. Shares of J.M. Smucker (SJM) sank 4.4% after the food and beverage manufacturer reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter. The company said tariff-related pressure on its U.S. retail coffee division—home to the Folgers, Dunkin', and Café Bustelo brands—weighed on its performance. An executive said Smucker is planning addition price hikes for its coffee products later this year. A 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on certain imports from Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, took effect earlier this month.

Nvidia (NVDA) reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday, posting revenue of $46.7 billion, a 56% increase from a year earlier. The results underscore the chipmaker’s role at the center of the AI boom, as demand for its high-powered processors showed little sign of slowing. Shares of the company fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, with some noting data center revenue as a bit soft at $41.1 billion against estimates of $41.29 billion. AI-linked tokens such as Internet Computer ICP$4.8278, NEAR Protocol, and Bittensor TAO$316.74 showed little reaction to the news, trading roughly flat from prior to the results.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Beats Wall Street Expectations And Sets Another Quarterly Sales Record

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The world’s most valuable company reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat Wall Street’s expectations yet again, with investors seeking clues into how Nvidia fared with challenges in the China market. Nvidia reported $46.7 billion in second-quarter revenue, surpassing the chip designer’s sales record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter and besting economist forecasts of $46.05 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. A bulk of Nvidia’s top-line came from nearly $41.1 billion in data center revenue, which Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote Monday would drive Nvidia’s business over the next year, behind predictions of $41.3 billion. The AI firm brought in adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 and $25.78 billion net income, besting Wall Street’s projections of $1.01 EPS and $24.7 billion, respectively. Nvidia’s top- and bottom-line figures account for annual increases of 6% and 42%, respectively trumping the year-earlier totals of $30 billion and $0.67 EPS. Nvidia shares briefly fell 4% in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s earnings report. The stock hit an intraday high of $184.12 earlier this month, while Nvidia shares traded around $181 before market close Wednesday. Nvidia will host a call with investors at 5 p.m. EDT. Some analysts are looking for answers from CEO Jensen Huang about the Chinese government pressuring domestic companies not to buy the company’s H20 AI processors over national security concerns, leading Nvidia reportedly to halt production. Morgan Stanley believes this “remains an important issue to resolve long term,” though it would likely be resolved “with both countries incentivized to enable access to U.S. hardware,” Moore wrote. Kevin Cassidy, an analyst for Rosenblatt Securities, wrote his firm believes Nvidia will introduce a “China-specific” alternative to the AI chip, which could “command a higher price point, better margins and offer a more competitive solution.” WedBush Securities, in a note Wednesday led by Seth Basham, said Nvidia is one of 30 companies that will “define the future of the AI revolution over the coming years.” The brokerage dispelled fears Nvidia and other AI firms would be the victims of a broader “stock market bubble,” adding, “The potential for AI to drive productivity and economic growth dwarfs past technologies.” As the last of the “Magnificent Seven” companies to report Q2 earnings this year, Nvidia closes out a three-month period of growing competition, specifically in China. Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon reported a record $402 million profit over the first half of 2025, though Wall Street remains optimistic for Nvidia’s growth prospects while backed by demand for AI technology and data centers. Analysts for Evercore ISI wrote earlier this month they believed rising cloud demand at companies like Amazon indicates AI has “hit a tipping point at enterprises,” as Nvidia’s chips are the “solution of choice” for training AI language models. The brokerage noted Nvidia remains its “top pick” in the near term and lifted its price target for Nvidia’s stock to $214 from $190.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.04. “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.” During the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $14.7 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 26, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to the Company’s share repurchase authorization, without expiration. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on October 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on September 11, 2025. Q2 Fiscal 2026 Summary Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its first quarter earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Title: When does Nvidia report earnings? Time, how to tune in

Time Published: 2025-08-27T20:03:06Z

Nvidia (NVDA) reported better than expected results in its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Aug. 27, roughly two weeks after the company agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of the sale of its H20 chips to China. The company reported $46.7 billion dollars in total revenue, a 56% rise year-over-year, with a corresponding rise in data center revenue. Still, analysts were expecting $41.3 billion in data center revenue and the company reported $41.1. Nvidia’s stock traded down to roughly $179 per share early on Wednesday, Aug. 27 but by around 4 p.m. ET, its stock rose to about $182, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares slipped in the after hours, trading around $176 or down around 3% as of 6:30 p.m. ET. The company previously said it expected to lose $8 billion in the second quarter after President Donald Trump banned the sale of its chips to China in April. Trump later rescinded the ban. Nvidia said in its earnings release that it sold none of it's chips made for the Chinese customers in the country but it "benefitted" from the release of $180 million in inventory to a customer outside of China. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings call that the company could ship $2 billion to $5 billion in revenue from the H20 chip in the thrid quarter if "political issues" are resolved. Analysts anticipated a 6.2% move for the stock, which could bring the to an all-time high of $192.88, or send it down to $170.66, mimicking its July levels. The company reported an EPS of $1.05, beating expectations of $1.01, and revenue of $46.7 billion, beating expectations of $46.1 billion. Additionally, the company announced a $60 billion share buyback program and issued guidance of $54 billion for the next quarter. The chipmaker’s earnings and sales were expected to jump 53% from a year ago to $45.9 billion, CNBC reported. Out of the last 12 financial reports, Nvidia has topped estimates 11 times. The stock is currently up 30% year-to-date. In July, Nvidia became the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap. Analyst Jacob Bourne of Emarketer pointed to the shortnening runway for AI and increased competetition for Nvidia stock slipping in commentarty provided to USA TODAY. "The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify," Bourne wrote. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said that the stock had been "priced at perfection" in provided commentary. "Even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation," Monteiro wrote.

Business Nvidia logo, computer chips and a 3D-printed representation of a robot hand are seen in this illustration taken August 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration AI hype that has helped push U.S. stocks to fresh records this year has driven an explosion in leveraged single stock exchange-traded funds, a universe of speculative products that is likely to be tested by Nvidia's Wednesday earnings. Companies that investors expect to benefit either directly or indirectly from the AI revolution now dominate U.S. single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs, underscoring investor demand for products that magnify their AI-themed bets, according to a Reuters analysis of industry data from issuers, Morningstar and CFRA Research. So far in 2025, asset managers have launched 112 U.S.-listed leveraged and inverse ETFs tied to a single stock, compared with 38 in all of 2024, according to data from Morningstar, CFRA Research and issuers, leading some analysts to warn the market is getting overcrowded. Leveraged and inverse ETFs, which allow investors to profit when shares rise or fall, use swaps or options to produce those targeted returns and are attractive to speculators eager to play daily price moves.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading All told, more than half of the total 190 single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs listed in the U.S. now riff off the AI theme, accounting for $17.7 billion of the $23.7 billion invested in the inverse and leveraged ETF universe, the Reuters analysis found. Those ETFs provide exposure to companies like AI-focused chipmakers like Nvidia, as well as hot AI plays like electric carmaker Tesla, whose futuristic robo-taxis rely on AI, data analytics software company Palantir, as well as energy companies powering AI data centers, like NuScale Power .One of the largest, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, has accumulated $4.56 billion in assets since its launch in December 2022.Some of the biggest swings in share prices and, in turn, leveraged stock ETFs, occur when a company announces earnings, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. Options traders are pricing in about a $260 billion swing in Nvidia's market value following its results, Reuters reported on Monday."There are more and more opportunities every day for investors to gamble on individual stocks that are part of this dominant AI theme, and any earnings announcement is going to be key," Armour said.That effect was highlighted on Tuesday, when shares in AI-driven database company MongoDB skyrocketed more than 23 per cent in after-hours trading, after it reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings and announced big gains in AI-related clients. That triggered a 46 per cent gain in the Tradr 2x Long MDB Daily ETF launched by Tradr ETFs only two weeks earlier. Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs, said the company is looking for new ways to explore the AI theme, pointing to a 2x ETF tied to Constellation Energy it launched in July. He expects that the demand for power generation to support data centers will surge alongside AI adoption."There is such a thirst for companies benefiting from the AI buzz," he said.RISKY PRODUCTS?But price swings in the underlying stocks magnify these ETFs' volatility, and critics caution that retail investors who are the predominant users may not fully grasp how the ETFs will react. In late January, Nvidia shares plunged 17 per cent on reports that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek released a large language model investors thought might chip away at Nvidia's dominance. The GraniteShares 2x ETF fell nearly 34 per cent. "We're providing what people want; if people want AI exposure, that's where we're going to focus resources," said Will Rhind, founder of GraniteShares.There are now just as many ETFs offering leveraged exposure to Nvidia as there are ETFs tied to the entire $52 trillion Standard & Poor's 500 index. "If you factor in the risk surrounding AI right now after all of its gains, and add the risk of leverage on top of that, well, there's more potential for losses," said Dave Nadig, president and director of research at ETF.com.While performance can vary depending on how the issuer obtains the leverage, or on the holding period, many of these ETFs have delivered results that hew closely to their target returns of 1.5x or 2x, industry executives point out."The underlying stock is going to do what it’s going to do, our job is to make sure ETF does what it says it will do," said Tradr's Markiewicz. For issuers, the products are attractive because they generally command fees averaging 0.96 per cent compared to 0.54 per cent for the ETF industry as a whole. But Nadig warned the market is overcrowded, adding there will likely be a "shakeout." All told, more than half of the total 190 single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs listed in the U.S. now riff off the AI theme, accounting for $17.7 billion of the $23.7 billion invested in the inverse and leveraged ETF universe, the Reuters analysis found. Those ETFs provide exposure to companies like AI-focused chipmakers like Nvidia, as well as hot AI plays like electric carmaker Tesla, whose futuristic robo-taxis rely on AI, data analytics software company Palantir, as well as energy companies powering AI data centers, like NuScale Power . One of the largest, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, has accumulated $4.56 billion in assets since its launch in December 2022. Some of the biggest swings in share prices and, in turn, leveraged stock ETFs, occur when a company announces earnings, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. Options traders are pricing in about a $260 billion swing in Nvidia's market value following its results, Reuters reported on Monday. "There are more and more opportunities every day for investors to gamble on individual stocks that are part of this dominant AI theme, and any earnings announcement is going to be key," Armour said. That effect was highlighted on Tuesday, when shares in AI-driven database company MongoDB skyrocketed more than 23 per cent in after-hours trading, after it reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings and announced big gains in AI-related clients. That triggered a 46 per cent gain in the Tradr 2x Long MDB Daily ETF launched by Tradr ETFs only two weeks earlier. Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs, said the company is looking for new ways to explore the AI theme, pointing to a 2x ETF tied to Constellation Energy it launched in July. He expects that the demand for power generation to support data centers will surge alongside AI adoption. "There is such a thirst for companies benefiting from the AI buzz," he said. RISKY PRODUCTS? But price swings in the underlying stocks magnify these ETFs' volatility, and critics caution that retail investors who are the predominant users may not fully grasp how the ETFs will react. In late January, Nvidia shares plunged 17 per cent on reports that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek released a large language model investors thought might chip away at Nvidia's dominance. The GraniteShares 2x ETF fell nearly 34 per cent. "We're providing what people want; if people want AI exposure, that's where we're going to focus resources," said Will Rhind, founder of GraniteShares. There are now just as many ETFs offering leveraged exposure to Nvidia as there are ETFs tied to the entire $52 trillion Standard & Poor's 500 index. "If you factor in the risk surrounding AI right now after all of its gains, and add the risk of leverage on top of that, well, there's more potential for losses," said Dave Nadig, president and director of research at ETF.com. While performance can vary depending on how the issuer obtains the leverage, or on the holding period, many of these ETFs have delivered results that hew closely to their target returns of 1.5x or 2x, industry executives point out. "The underlying stock is going to do what it’s going to do, our job is to make sure ETF does what it says it will do," said Tradr's Markiewicz. For issuers, the products are attractive because they generally command fees averaging 0.96 per cent compared to 0.54 per cent for the ETF industry as a whole. But Nadig warned the market is overcrowded, adding there will likely be a "shakeout."
