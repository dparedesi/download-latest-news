Nvidia (NVDA) shares led losses on the Dow and S&P 500 Monday afternoon following a report China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test a rival artificial intelligence chip. According to The Wall Street Journal, Huawei "is gearing up to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, which the company hopes could replace some higher-end products" from Nvidia. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that "Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D." Shares of Nvidia, which declined to comment on the report, were down close to 4% in recent trading. They've lost a fifth of their value since the start of the year, and have yet to fully recover from their plunge on Jan. 27 that wiped nearly $600 billion from the company's market cap when Chinese startup DeepSeek said its models rivaled those of OpenAI's Chat GPT at a fraction of the cost. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it is expecting to record a $5.5 billion first-quarter charge after the U.S. limited exports of its H20 chips to China. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect Nvidia declined to comment.

Title: Nvidia faces a new threat from Huawei

Chinese tech giant Huawei is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%), according to a new report. Huawei Technologies will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips from manufacturers as soon as the end of May, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The processor is Huawei‚Äôs most powerful AI semiconductor to date. According to the report, Huawei is hopeful that the chips will be more powerful than Nvidia‚Äôs H100 AI training chip, which it released in 2022. The Shenzhen-based firm boosts the chip‚Äôs performance by packing in more silicon. Shares of Nvidia were down about 3.5% by late Monday morning. The chip is in the early stages of development and will need to undergo testing with an initial batch of customers to measure its performance, the sources said. Huawei, one of China‚Äôs biggest tech companies, has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it. The firm has been on a U.S.-trade blacklist for six years, and the U.S. restricts chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms in an effort to curb the country‚Äôs advancements with AI chip technology. The tightening restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt blows to Nvidia by limiting its potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules ‚Äî but those rules became even stricter and barred the Santa Clara, California-based company from selling them in China. Beijing has slammed the U.S.‚Äô approach and President Donald Trump‚Äôs attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China‚Äôs foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries ‚Äúat the expense of China,‚Äù framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Nvidia is the world‚Äôs most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $2.6 trillion. But its shares are down 22.5% this year in the face of Trump‚Äôs escalating trade war with China. ‚ÄîCatherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: What is the Inverse Cramer Meme? Jokes About Following the Opposite of Jim Cramer's Investment Advice, Explained

Matt Schimkowitz ‚Ä¢ 6 years ago Mateus Lima ‚Ä¢ about a month ago Sakshi Rakshale ‚Ä¢ about a month ago Owen Carry ‚Ä¢ 2 days ago Sakshi Rakshale ‚Ä¢ 2 months ago üó≥ Cast Your Vote To Select The Meme Of The Month! üó≥ Published April 27, 2025 Jim Cramer is one of the most recognizable figures in American finance media, known for his energetic stock picks and bold predictions on CNBC's Mad Money. Over the years, however, a growing number of investors and internet users have noticed a pattern: Cramer's recommendations during crucial market moments have not performed well. In response, online communities developed the "Inverse Cramer" meme and slang term, a running joke and informal strategy suggesting that doing the opposite of Cramer‚Äôs advice could be more profitable. Here‚Äôs how the meme started, why it spread, and what it looks like today. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC‚Äôs Mad Money since March 2005, is infamous for dramatic, sometimes ill-fated investment advice. During the 2008 financial crisis, Cramer advised buying Bear Stearns, just weeks before it collapsed. He also encouraged holding onto Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before their infamous downfalls. A clip of the show uploaded by YouTuber politiclips on March 17th, 2008, has over 500,000 views 17 years later. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2009 that betting against Cramer‚Äôs "buys" could net a 25 percent return in a month. CBS News confirmed similar findings in 2012, with a 22 percent portfolio gain in just 22 days by doing the opposite. The "Inverse Cramer" meme suggests that one can succeed in the stock market simply by doing the opposite of Jim Cramer‚Äôs advice. While jokes about this date back to 2008, the phrase "Inverse Cramer" first surfaced on Twitter via @WSBConsensus on October 10, 2017, in a post about shorting NVIDIA and going long on AMD, which echoed in a popular /r/Amd thread on Reddit later that month. Don't forget the infamous "Inverse Cramer" Short $NVDA Long $AMD #BuyNVDAPuts #BuyAMDCalls $MU $APPL $GOOGL $HMNY https://t.co/9QUvAetUTv ‚Äî WallStreetBets & Co. (@WSBConsensus) October 10, 2017 The idea found a home in online finance communities like the subreddit /r/WallStreetBets and FinTwit by 2019, where posts joking about "inversing" Cramer routinely earned hundreds to thousands of upvotes. As Cramer‚Äôs misfires piled up, the meme matured from a casual jab into a half-serious investment philosophy. On December 15th, 2021, Twitter user @iAnonPatriot posted a screenshot of Cramer tweeting negatively about AMC Entertainment stock. Despite Cramer‚Äôs warning, AMC‚Äôs share price rose significantly, leading @iAnonPatriot to caption it with sarcasm and highlight the inverse trend. The next day, on December 16th, Redditor /u/jsza87 posted to /r/wallstreetbets with the title "Always inverse Jim Cramer," gathering over 8,000 upvotes since. The post featured a collage of stock tickers that all declined sharply after Cramer had recommended them. By early March 2023, the joke had grown large enough that Redditor /u/HYPED_UP_ON_CHARTS announced, "The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived," on /r/wallstreetbets. The post, which earned over 9,000 upvotes in the last two years, presented an ETF that allowed people to automatically short stocks recommended by Cramer. What started as a meme has turned into an actual, tradable financial strategy. The meme stayed relevant through new market events even into this year. For instance, on April 5th, 2025, after Cramer warned of a coming "Black Monday" stock crash, X user @fprosk joked, "We are really testing the limits of the Reverse Jim Cramer now," gathering over 50,000 likes in just a couple of days. Finally, the meme broke into even bigger mainstream attention when Elon Musk referenced it. On April 25th, 2025, after Jim Cramer said during a CNBC segment, "I'm putting my chips on Elon Musk," Musk responded on X with, "Uh oh üò¨ Inverse Cramer is tough karma to overcome! I‚Äôm calling weekend reviews with Autopilot to accelerate progress." For the full history of Inverse Cramer, be sure to check out Know Your Meme's encyclopedia entry for more information.

U.S. stocks were on track for a flat to slightly lower open Monday as investors geared up for a jam-packed week of earnings spanning pizza chains, semiconductor makers, and sanitation giants. Here are the stocks likely to dominate today‚Äôs headlines: Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificial intelligence chip designed to challenge some of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA+0.35%) top offerings, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ascend 910D represents a major step in China‚Äôs push to build a self-sufficient tech industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia shares fell about 1.5% in premarket trading following the report. Domino‚Äôs beat earnings expectations but missed on revenue, posting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. CEO Russell Weiner said the company is staying focused on ‚Äúcontrolling what is under its control‚Äù in a ‚Äúchallenging macroeconomic environment,‚Äù while celebrating early progress under its ‚ÄúHungry for MORE‚Äù five-year plan. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5%, while international same-store sales rose 3.7% excluding currency impacts. Domino‚Äôs stock slipped roughly 2% before the bell. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) will report after the close, with investors zeroing in on margin trends and pricing power. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) could provide a key window into how much R&D spending chipmakers are sustaining in a tighter environment. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Later in the week, Microsoft (MSFT+0.74%) and Meta (META+0.81%) are set to headline earnings after the bell Wednesday, offering critical updates on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital advertising trends. Amazon (AMZN-0.15%) and Apple (AAPL+0.52%) follow on Thursday, with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.45%) closing out the week on Friday ‚Äî wrapping up one of the busiest earnings stretches of the year. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies‚Äô leadership mentioned ‚Äúworse‚Äù or ‚Äúweaker‚Äù far more often than ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äústronger‚Äù during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism falling to its lowest ratio since 2008.

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause ‚Äî now about 20% complete ‚Äî and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a ‚Äúfull-blown crisis,‚Äù according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned ‚Äúworse‚Äù or ‚Äúweaker‚Äù far more often than ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äústronger‚Äù during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China‚Äôs tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino‚Äôs Pizza (DPZ+0.67%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino‚Äôs CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúcontrol what is under its control‚Äù in a ‚Äúchallenging macroeconomic environment,‚Äù and boasted about progress under the chain‚Äôs ‚ÄúHungry for MORE‚Äù five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino‚Äôs stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL+1.40%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP+0.68%) rounds out the day‚Äôs lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook ‚Äî particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel. Later this week, Microsoft (MSFT+0.74%) and Meta (META+0.81%) report after the bell Wednesday, giving investors a read on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital ad trends. Amazon (AMZN-0.15%) and Apple (AAPL+0.52%) are on deck Thursday, while Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.45%) is set to follow on Friday, capping one of the biggest earnings weeks of the year.

Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500‚Äôs blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week‚Äôs rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500‚Äôs market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet‚Äôs results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino‚Äôs Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald‚Äôs (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn‚Äôt invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchasers will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchasers at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren‚Äôt the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire‚Äôs diversified group of businesses.

More of their meeting at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on April 21, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 40% or more in the upcoming months? Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that‚Äôs like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don‚Äôt be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over. This contrarian view isn‚Äôt just gut instinct - it‚Äôs part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks. If you believe markets are rational and always priced right, consider this: the U.S. may be running a demand deficit far more dangerous than its trade deficit. Read: The Real U.S Trade Deficit Armageddon Let‚Äôs be real - Nvidia has a boom-bust pattern that‚Äôs hard to ignore. Every time the hype gets too hot - whether it‚Äôs crypto, gaming, or AI - Nvidia‚Äôs stock overshoots and pays for it later. What makes you think it will be different this time? Nvidia is a classic example of how you have to bear extreme volatility while chasing returns. We combine different categories of stocks to lower the volatility while maintaining exposure to the upside in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
