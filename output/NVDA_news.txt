Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812
Time Published: 2025-09-30T22:39:30Z
Full Content:
After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: The 10 Strongest-Performing Mega-Cap Stocks Of 2025

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.

U.S. stocks fell slightly today as worries over a possible government shutdown grew. Investors are concerned that the shutdown could delay important economic data, including jobs and inflation reports. These reports are crucial for the Federal Reserve to decide on interest rate changes. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all showed minor losses. Traders adopted a cautious “wait-and-see” approach, uncertain about how long a shutdown could last and its impact on the economy.

September 29, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoRL -- NVIDIA today announced that the open‑source Newton Physics Engine is now available in NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab, along with the open NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.6 reasoning vision language action model for robot skills and new AI infrastructure. Together, these technologies provide developers and researchers with an open, accelerated robotics platform that speeds iteration, standardizes testing, unifies training with on‑robot inference and helps robots transfer skills safely and reliably from simulation to the real world. “Humanoids are the next frontier of physical AI, requiring the ability to reason, adapt and act safely in an unpredictable world,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “With these latest updates, developers now have the three computers to bring robots from research into everyday life — with Isaac GR00T serving as robot’s brains, Newton simulating their body and NVIDIA Omniverse as their training ground.” Newton Opens New Standard for Physical Simulation in RoboticsRobots learn faster and safer in simulation, but humanoid robots — with their complex joints, balance and movements — push today’s physics engines to the limit. Over a quarter-million robotics developers worldwide need accurate physics, so the skills they teach robots in simulation can be executed safely and reliably in the real world. Today, NVIDIA announced the beta release of Newton, an open-source, GPU-accelerated physics engine, managed by the Linux Foundation. Built on the NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD frameworks, and codeveloped by Google DeepMind, Disney Research and NVIDIA, Newton is available now. With Newton’s flexible design and ability to work with different types of physics solvers, developers can now simulate extremely complex robot actions, like walking through snow or gravel and handling cups and fruits, and successfully deploy them in the real world. The latest adopters of Newton are esteemed research labs and universities such as ETH Zurich Robotic Systems Lab, Technical University of Munich and Peking University, robotics company Lightwheel, and simulation engine company Style3D. Cosmos Reason Improves Robot Reasoning for New Open Isaac GR00T N1.6 ModelTo perform humanlike tasks in the physical world, humanoids must understand ambiguous instructions and deal with the long tail of never-before-seen experiences. The latest release of the open Isaac GR00T N1.6 robot foundation model, available soon on Hugging Face, will integrate NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason, an open, customizable reasoning vision language model built for physical AI. Acting as the robot’s deep-thinking brain, Cosmos Reason turns vague instructions into step-by-step plans, using prior knowledge, common sense and physics to handle new situations and generalize across many tasks. Cosmos Reason, downloaded over 1 million times and currently at the top of the Physical Reasoning Leaderboard on Hugging Face, can also curate and annotate large sets of real and synthetic data for model training. Cosmos Reason 1 is now available as an easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for AI model deployment. Isaac GR00T N1.6 now lets humanoids move and handle objects simultaneously, allowing more torso and arm freedom to complete tough tasks like opening heavier doors. Developers can post-train Isaac GR00T N models using the open-source NVIDIA Physical AI Dataset on Hugging Face. Downloaded over 4.8 million times, the dataset now includes thousands of synthetic and real-world trajectories. Leading robot makers such as AeiROBOT, Franka Robotics, LG Electronics, Lightwheel, Mentee Robotics, Neura Robotics, Solomon, Techman Robot and UCR are evaluating Isaac GR00T N models for building general-purpose robots. New Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI Development NVIDIA announced new updates to its open Cosmos WFMs, downloaded over 3 million times, that let developers generate diverse data for accelerating training physical AI models at scale using text, image and video prompts. New Workflow for Teaching Robot Grasping Teaching a robot to grab an object is one of the most difficult challenges in robotics. It is not just about moving an arm but turning a thought into a precise action — a skill robots must learn through trial and error. The new dexterous grasping workflow in the developer preview of Isaac Lab 2.3, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform, trains multi-fingered hand and arm robots in a virtual world using an automated curriculum. It starts with simple tasks and gradually ramps up the complexity. The workflow changes aspects like gravity, friction and the weight of an object, training robots to learn skills even in unpredictable environments. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robots learned grasping using this workflow to significantly improve its manipulation capabilities. Leading robot developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, Skild AI, Solomon and Techman Robot are adopting NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse technologies. Evaluating Learned Robot Skills in SimulationGetting a robot to master a new skill — like picking up a cup or walking across a room — is incredibly difficult, and testing these skills on a physical robot is slow and expensive. The solution lies in simulation, which offers a way to test a robot’s learned skills against countless scenarios, tasks and environments. But even in simulation, developers tend to build fragmented, simplified tests that do not reflect the real world. A robot that learns to navigate a perfect, simple simulation will fail the moment it faces real-world complexity. To let developers run complex, large-scale evaluations in a simulated environment without having to build the system from scratch, NVIDIA and Lightwheel are codeveloping Isaac Lab - Arena, an open-source policy evaluation framework for scalable experimentation and standardized testing. The framework will be available soon. New NVIDIA AI Infrastructure Powers Robotics Workloads AnywhereTo enable developers to take full advantage of these advanced technologies and software libraries, NVIDIA announced AI infrastructure designed for the most demanding workloads, including: NVIDIA Advances Robotics ResearchNVIDIA technologies, including GPUs, simulation frameworks and CUDA®‑accelerated libraries, were referenced in nearly half of CoRL’s accepted papers — with adoption across leading research labs and institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, ETH Zurich and National University of Singapore. Also highlighted at CoRL is BEHAVIOR, a robotic learning benchmark project by the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab and Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform for advancing vision-based tactile robotics, developed by Peking University.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels After Stock Surged 20% Last Week

Time Published: 2025-09-29T13:34:37Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments. The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company. Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring. Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week. Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023. Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range. A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year. Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.
