Asset allocation dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories. For a long time now, it seems like the stock market has had a “theme of the year.” Clearly in 2024 it was AI, while 2023 was the year of recovery from 2022, which was a year of panic over a recession that never came. This is odd, as past trends have lasted several years. From 2012 to 2014, for example, it was momentum driven by the Fed’s quantitative easing after the financial crisis. And the dot-com-bubble years spanned more or less from 1994 to 2000. So will 2025 be another “theme year,” or will we see markets shift back to embracing longer-term trends? (Hint: I’m expecting the former, and we’re going to front-run the main theme I see for 2025 to grab ourselves some nice 10%+ dividends paid monthly.) A quick glance at 2024 offers some clues as to where things are headed. Bull Market Above we see the performance of the benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple) and NASDAQ 100 (in orange), as of this writing. As you can see, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 rose almost the same amount. That’s surprising; we’d expect the NASDAQ’s tilt toward AI names like Amazon.com (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) to propel it ahead of the S&P 500. But things are, of course, more complicated than that. For one, consider that 61% of large American companies are planning to use AI to automate tasks. In other words, it’s not just tech benefiting from AI, but firms from across the entire economy. This is good for the whole market, so it’s not surprising that the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 would more or less keep pace with one another. The S&P 500 now has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 28, a level it’s only reached a few times in the last 40 years: late 2019, mid 2008, early 2001 and late 1997. Each of these peaks, unfortunately, came right before a bear market. However, there is good news here. First, in 2001, 2008 and 2019, these peaks were hit after a bear market had already begun. In other words, the market hit this high valuation because earnings fell, decreasing the “E” in the P/E ratio and driving up the number overall. So today isn’t really comparable to those eras. The bad news, though, is that 1997 was like today. At the height of the dot-com bubble, stocks priced in future gains that didn’t appear. If AI flops, we could see a similar correction to the one that occurred in the late 1990s. The problem is that there’s no way to know if that pullback will happen in 2025 or, say, 2030 (or at all). So selling now could result in lost money in the long term. With all this in mind, my prediction is this: 2025 will be the year more investors look beyond stocks, particularly for ways to profit from the still-strong market while hedging their downside. That path leads straight to corporate bonds, which yield 7.3% as I write this, for companies with credit ratings of BB+ or below. And our favorite income plays, closed-end funds (CEFs), let us tap corporate bonds for even higher dividends to the tune of 10%+. Our play, then, is to front-run the crowd into these funds, which include the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), a CEF yielding 10.1% that pays dividends monthly. When it comes to high-yield bonds, many people irrationally worry about defaults. But here’s the truth: Even in the worst crisis, default rates would only spike to around 10%, so if you buy a CEF like GHY, which has bonds from 405 different issuers, you’d sharply limit your risk of loss. Bear in mind, too, that the fund is run by five portfolio managers from Prudential (PRU), a company with a deep bench of talent and resources, providing even more reassurance here. Moreover, the default rates on high-yield bonds are currently around 1%—imperceptible in most CEFs, including GHY. This little-known fund is also well diversified across sectors: GHY Holdings GHY is also well diversified around the world, with a strong base (47.5% of assets) in the US. That’s a nice setup for 2025, when interest rates are expected to decline in the US, sending capital looking for higher returns elsewhere. Also, the fund yields 10.1%, and that yield is pretty reliable, as GHY hasn’t reduced distributions in five years, and in 2024 it out-earned its payouts, suggesting dividends remain covered. Then there’s the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV). This is the main CEF valuation metric, and right now GHY is discounted, trading at 4.7% below its portfolio value. That discount faded steadily through 2024 before plateauing at its current level in November. If 2025 boosts demand from investors looking for high-yield alternatives to stocks, as I expect it to, GHY’s discount could shrink further. But even if demand holds steady, GHY still has reason to climb, thanks to its strong long-term performance history. As you can see below, GHY (in purple) has more than doubled the corporate-bond benchmark index fund (in orange) over the last decade: GHY Outperforms Double-digit yields and this wind at the fund’s back are strong selling points, with the high price of stocks sealing the deal. Add in the diversification away from stocks that GHY provides, and the fund is an attractive option now. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a “Santa Claus" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Bank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. "What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software," Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, "the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product." Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. "In our view, these are short-term issues," he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data. To be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however. Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Nvidia Stock Vs. Custom AI Chips: Should Investors Worry?

Signage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Nvidia stock had a stellar 2024, rising by almost 3x to about $135 per share. Business has boomed led by the surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the backbone of the generative artificial intelligence era. That said, over the last month or so investors appear to have their eyes on another sector of the semiconductor market, namely ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that could play a bigger role in AI computing. This comes after two major ASIC players, Broadcom and Marvell Technology, reported a surge in demand for their ASICs from large cloud customers in the most recent quarters. Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? For instance, Broadcom’s sales from its custom AI chips and networking processors surged by 220% to $12.2 billion in 2024, up from $3.8 billion in revenue that the company generated from AI silicon in FY’23. To be sure, Nvidia’s sales are head and shoulders above, estimated to come in at about $129 billion this fiscal year, but its growth rates are slowing. So could ASICs threaten Nvidia’s AI dominance as the market matures? Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. ASICS vs GPUs ASICs have been around for more than five decades. However, they are seeing renewed interest in the AI era. While GPUs from companies such as Nvidia are pretty versatile and can be programmed for AI as well as other tasks, ASICs are custom-designed semiconductors built to perform specific tasks giving them certain advantages versus general processors. By focusing on targeted functionalities these chips offer several advantages versus GPUs for AI. For instance, these specialized chips could be more cost-effective than GPUs, which are designed for a wider range of applications. ASICs also consume less electricity and this makes them ideal for data centers aiming to reduce electricity costs - a key cost of operating large AI systems. ASICs can also achieve higher performance for dedicated tasks than general-purpose GPUs from Nvidia or AMD as they are purpose-built. These chips could be well suited for large cloud computing providers given that they operate at a scale that can justify the design and development costs of ASICs. For instance, Broadcom, a company that is viewed as the biggest beneficiary of a potential pivot toward ASICs, recently said that three of its hyperscaler customers intend to build clusters of 1 million custom chips across a single network. Change In The AI Space Benefits ASICs Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the significantly front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments just yet. See How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see more customers looking toward ASICs to reduce upfront costs as well as operating costs. The longer-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. ASIC chips customized for inference could also be a top choice for these tasks. There is some historical precedent to this as well. For example, in the the crypto industry, Bitcoin miners initially used GPUs for mining, but some large players have since switched to ASICs as they scaled up given their better hash rates (effectively how many guesses the system makes per second to solve the crypto puzzle) and overall cost-effectiveness. What This Means For Nvidia While NVDA stock has seen strong growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four years; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what lies ahead for Nvidia stock? To be sure, we don’t expect Nvidia’s business to be supplanted by these new waves of processors, given the company’s head start in the AI market and its deeply entrenched CUDA software stack and development tools which results in high switching costs for customers. Moreover, if the market sees a strong shift, Nvidia too could potentially expand its presence in the space. However, Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully account for the potential risks and slowing growth. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, about 32% below the current market price.

Title: AI takes over CES 2025, one smart gadget at a time

Just when you thought your toaster couldn’t get any smarter, CES 2025 is about to prove you wrong. The world’s biggest tech show returns to Las Vegas from January 7-10, promising to stuff artificial intelligence into literally everything that has a power button. The AI gold rush remains in full swing: Samsung’s going all-in with its “AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere” vision — including AI fridges that promise to anticipate temperature changes when you’re unloading groceries — because apparently your lettuce needed a smart assistant. LG is getting oddly personal with what they’re calling “Affectionate Intelligence” (yes, really). Even Samsung’s startup incubator is showing off AI everything – from video production to exercise coaching to energy management. The message is clear: if your gadget doesn’t have AI in 2025, does it even exist? But this year’s real battleground is AI agents. After 2024's mixed bag of AI companions (pour one out for the Humane Pin and the half-baked Rabbit R1), tech giants are betting that what we really want is AI assistants baked into everything we own. The pitch for these empowered AI bots is that you won’t have to open apps for every little task; this tech promises to handle everything from scheduling your day to ordering your coffee, all through natural conversation. Whether they’ll actually deliver this time – or show any actual affection – remains to be seen. And yes, somehow, the TV industry has found its next revolution: a fancier cable. While the exact specs of HDMI 2.2 are still under wraps, it promises to surpass the impressive 10K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates of HDMI 2.1. Translation: Your movies and games are about to get even prettier, smoother, and more detailed — if you can find any 10K content to actually watch. On the computing front, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage for what promises to be another leather-jacketed keynote about next-gen GPUs. Industry leaks suggest the RTX 5090 could be up to 70% faster than its predecessor, which already had “unholy power,” according to one reviewer. Not to be outdone, Intel and AMD are also expected to announce chips that will make your current gaming rig feel like a calculator. Speaking of chips, 2025 is shaping up to be the year PC makers try to convince you that your computer isn’t smart enough. After 2024's first wave of AI PCs with Copilot+ buttons and 16GB RAM requirements, Microsoft’s (MSFT) next generation promises even more powerful NPUs and AI features. Dell, HP, and friends are hoping you’ll upgrade your Windows 10 machine (which loses support next year) to a shiny new AI-powered PC. Just don’t expect an immediate productivity boost – studies show current AI PC owners actually spend more time figuring out how to talk to their computers than getting actual work done. But hey, at least you’ll feel fancy while your PC makes you feel technologically illiterate. The auto industry continues its transformation into a tech show within a tech show. Hyundai’s Mobis division is set to steal some spotlight with what they’re calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display. This isn’t just a fancy heads-up display, it’s a screen that spans from driver to passenger, promising to overlay navigation, vehicle info, and safety alerts across your entire field of view. Think Iron Man’s helmet display, but for your car. BMW’s not far behind, planning to debut their own take with something called the Panoramic iDrive display. About 100,000 tech enthusiasts, industry professionals, and AI chatbots (kidding — that would make it more like 200,000) will descend upon the Las Vegas Convention Center and Venetian Expo for the event. As always, CES promises to show us the future, or at least what tech companies think we’ll buy in the near future. Whether all these innovations actually make it to market in 2025 is another story entirely, but hey, that’s half the fun of CES. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Santa may not be visiting Wall Street this year after all. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday and has lost ground in five straight sessions, giving investors little hope of getting a Santa Claus rally, which is the tendency for stocks to rise during the last five sessions of a year and the first two of the new year. The index would have to rise 1.8% on Friday to get back into positive territory for the seven-day period this year. Granted, 2024 was an exceptional year for stocks, even without an end-of-year boost. The S&P 500 rose more than 20% for a second straight year, its first such stretch this millennium. But a Santa Claus rally is more than just a cherry on top of a year; it’s sometimes also seen as an omen. The Santa Claus rally is historically correlated with stocks’ January and full-year performance. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has, on average, returned 1.4% in January and 10.4% in the calendar year after a Santa Claus rally, according to a recent analysis by LPL Financial. (The S&P 500 was launched in 1957; stock performance before this year is based on its predecessor index, the S&P 90.) In years without a Santa Claus rally, the index’s average January return has been slightly negative and its full-year return has averaged just 5%. While the odds of a Santa Claus rally appeared slim on Thursday, stock market experts remain optimistic about the prospects for 2025. Stocks are generally expected to be supported by incoming President Donald Trump, who has vowed to extend the corporate tax cuts of his first term and slash regulations. The U.S. economy’s continued strength is also expected to underpin corporate profits, which experts believe will broaden after two years of narrow leadership. The Magnificent Seven stocks are still expected to grow profit faster than the average S&P 500 company, but by the slimmest margin in seven years, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze is also seen evolving this year as the use of AI becomes more widespread. A small number of companies—most of them semiconductor and networking hardware companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO)—have thus far benefited from the AI revolution. Experts believe a greater variety of companies will begin to reap those benefits in 2025 as new infrastructure comes online and businesses find novel applications for the technology. Donald Trump is known for treating the stock market’s performance as a proxy for the success of his administration. Yet, his impending presidency is a major source of uncertainty, which could make for a bumpy ride this year. Many of Trump’s signature policy proposals, if implemented, could have knock-on effects that drag on stocks. His proposed tariffs could help stoke inflation by disrupting global supply chains and raising costs for businesses. Deportations of the magnitude Trump has promised would likely also boost inflation. Resurgent inflation could force Federal Reserve officials to keep interest rates at a level they deem “restrictive,” which would stifle consumer demand and put extra pressure on businesses. Higher interest rates also would likely translate to higher bond yields and a stronger dollar, both of which would weigh on riskier assets like stocks.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year — making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline traders returned from Wednesday's holiday shutdown. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." But the decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years of over-20% gains in a row — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks rose modestly, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all climbing as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA stole the proverbial show in 2024, sometimes going so far as to cushion the entire market via the relentless rise in its market capitalization. Now, it seems that the GPU maker is on course to repeat the stellar notes of its 2024 performance, as per the tidbits that can be gleaned from the latest investment note penned by Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya. To wit, while conceding that the broader overtones of NVIDIA's keynote address at the upcoming CES are already known, Arya asserts that the tradeshow still remains a positive catalyst for the GPU manufacturer's shares: "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets." At the upcoming CES tradeshow, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide critical updates on its overarching robotics strategy and the Jetson Thor platform for humanoid robots, which aligns with the emerging theme around "physical AI." The BofA analyst also expects NVIDIA to launch RTX 50xx - the PC gaming variants of its Blackwell GPUs that are expected to boast of "enhanced 'neural rendering' and faster GDDR7 memory." Moreover, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide another update on its data center/AI GPU lineup, "incl. current-gen Blackwell (GB200, B200), 2H upgraded variants (GB300, B300 – more memory (288GB using 12 stack High HBM 3E) for more accurate AI inference) and teaser on next-gen Rubin (CY26E)." Finally, and perhaps most critically, Arya is looking for NVIDIA's official entry in the "AI PC [market] likely via partnership or (small) chance of standalone PC CPU." This aligns with a separate note recently penned by Truist Securities analyst Will Stein, wherein he announced: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." Coming back, in light of the anticipated developments at the CES, Arya has reiterated a 'Buy' rating on NVIDIA shares with a $190 stock price target: "Reiterate Buy on our sector top pick, Nvidia , ahead of CES tradeshow that starts Jan-6 with keynote and other events featuring NVDA CEO." For reference, NVIDIA is currently trading at the $135 price handle in today's pre-market trading. This corresponds to a ~40 percent upside potential relative to Arya's stated target price for the GPU manufacturer's shares. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of TSDD

December 31, 2024 16:50 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above, while the per Share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund’s total market value, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares slid 2 percent to $134.9 during one low of $135.67 in trading. Trading was very quiet, and the volume was out of 45.6 million shares, less than 10% of the average daily volume of 376.9 million shares. At the close on Friday, the stock finished at $137.49. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. While NVIDIA shares suffered a minor setback, Wall Street analysts are still optimistic that NVIDIA's long-term growth prospects will be strong. Earlier this month, Susquehanna raised its price target on the semiconductor giant from $160 to $180 and maintained its 'positive' rating. TD Cowen also reiterated a "buy" rating with a hike to its price target from $165 to $175. Other firms, among them Truist Financial and The Goldman Sachs Group, also raised their targets after they said they saw strong demand for NVIDIA's products in AI and data center markets. Da Davidson, however, was more measured, lifting its price target and putting a 'neutral' rating on the stock. NVIDIA ranked Moderately Buy with 39 "buy" ratings, 4 "holds" and 1 "strong buy." It now sets the consensus price target for the stock at $164.15. Despite short term fluctuations, the analysts report that NVIDIA is in a strong position to fuel future growth, with new artificial intelligence, gaming, and enterprise markets making the stock an attractive sell point for longer term investors.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on NVIDIA (NVDA): The King of AI GPUs Under Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. As 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven’t been so lucky. As an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world’s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period. So why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company. However, while the GPU maker hasn’t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm’s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn’t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion. But an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock’s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren’t impressed and they weren’t optimistic about the firm’s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO’s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention. The start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself – a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors. The announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications. For his part, Cramer isn’t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve’s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won’t recover quickly according to Cramer as “rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing” pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated: “How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-20-24 Performance Since Then: 7.73% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s leading AI GPU designer. Since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT, the firm’s shares have gained more than 700%. Yet, since their July peak, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have added just 1.62% as investors wait to see how its Blackwell GPUs perform and whether any rivals pop up. The stock has also been hit with speculation of rivals stealing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI GPU market share due to supply constraints and high prices. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock dipped by 3% in December after Broadcom shared that it can earn as much as $90 billion in AI revenue by 2027. Here’s what Cramer said about the firm in August: “I almost feel like you can guess it—it’s Nvidia. It’s the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia’s drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, “Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There’s too much pressure on Nvidia—can it sustain it? I don’t want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Third in the S&P 500, behind only Palantir (PLTR, Financials) and Vistra Corp., Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financials), a global leader in artificial intelligence and image processing technologies, had its stock increase an incredible 178%. This leap indicates that Nvidia's AI-powered hardware and software solutions are much sought after in a fast changing tech environment. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though Nvidia had an outstanding year, recently its pricing has been rather erratic. From its all-time high in November, the share price dropped 1.3% on December 30. Analysts claim this is a result of individuals profiting and growing concern about the state of the semiconductor business getting more challenging. Currently challenging their 21-day exponential moving average, Nvidia's shares show a technical indication often seen as a potential support level. Regarding the future, CEO Jensen Huang will discuss the "Rubin," next-generation AI processor the business developed at the January 6 Consumer Electronics Show. With the presentation, Nvidia hopes to demonstrate that, in an area increasingly dependent on sophisticated networking technologies, artificial intelligence infrastructure is still under its leadership. Following European Commission clearance of antitrust issues, Nvidia completed its $700 million acquisition of the Israeli artificial intelligence startup Run:ai. The purchase is supposed to increase Nvidia's capacity to handle AI chores, therefore boosting its degree of competition. Run:ai has also indicated they want their software to be open source, therefore benefiting the artificial intelligence field overall. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Why Nvidia’s (NVDA) China Revenue Is Guaranteed Despite Restrictions

As the US continues to navigate an AI trade war with China, some startling revelations have raised questions about the effectiveness of its semiconductor export controls. According to a report published by The Information, ByteDance is planning to spend as much as $7 billion on buying Nvidia chips in 2025. The US government is yet to react to this revelation, but there’s a good chance they won’t be happy with the Chinese firm’s plans. Since 2022, the United States has placed export restrictions on many advanced semiconductor chips, including Nvidia’s Blackwell predecessor, the Hopper GPUs. Nvidia has circumvented this ban by creating a variant of the H100 GPU called the H800 GPU. This was essentially a dumbed-down version of the most powerful GPU available at the time. Nvidia achieved this by restricting the bandwidth, resulting in reduced communication speed between the GPUs. This helped them comply with export regulations at the time. Chinese companies were happy to receive the H800s. However, they also figured out a new way to get access to Nvidia’s latest chips. If they built a data center in any of their neighboring countries and imported the Nvidia chips there, they could circumvent the export ban. That’s what ByteDance plans to do as well. For context, ByteDance is the owner of Doubao, the most-used AI chatbot in China with 51 million users. The company plans to continue its domination and for that, it is willing to go to great lengths to get its hands on Nvidia’s latest GPUs. So what does this mean for Nvidia? We already know that Nvidia’s China revenue has gone down from 25% of the total revenue to 15% over the last few years. But is it just a case of the missing revenue being diverted to other places and the products still ending up in China? After this development, that seems to be the likely case. This would mean that no matter how China and the US settle their trade disputes, China will, one way or the other, get its hands on Nvidia GPUs. As both countries try to hurt each other financially, Nvidia can come out unscated, or even the winner! Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wedbush Securities has identified Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) as main winners of a rise in artificial intelligence investments predicted to define 2025. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Underlying approximately $2 trillion in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years, analysts headed by Daniel Ives predict a 25% rise in technology company prices for the year. According to the research, leading IT companies will have a good platform thanks to less regulations and more acceptance of powerful artificial intelligence technologies. According to the research, software businesses like Salesforce and Palantir are well suited to gain from the introduction of big language models and generative artificial intelligence technologies. Emphasizing Nvidia's central influence in the AI scene, the analysts characterized the company's processors as essential infrastructure enabling developments in many other sectors. Additionally expected to profit on the rising need for AI-powered solutions are cloud services such those from Microsoft's (MSFT, Financials) Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon's (AMZN, Financials) Amazon Web Services. The research sees such times as chances for investors to build holdings in technology, even while it notes possible difficulties in the form of economic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty. Described as entering a "consumption phase" in 2025, the wider corporate use of artificial intelligence is likely to propel the sector's growth path even further.

US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the sour final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. The major indexes posted big wins in 2024, a year that was marked by a continued surge in the artificial intelligence trade — led by the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — even as the bull rally broadened across the board. The single biggest winner in the S&P was Palantir (PLTR), with a nearly 350% gain for the year, while the biggest loser was Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which gave up 64% of its value. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate cut in four years, and President-elect Donald Trump's impending return to the White House drove stocks higher in the last two months. (Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish.

Update font size. Reset Following a late-2024 pullback, AI stocks, including Apple, are set to resume climbing in 2025, a Wall Street analyst says. “We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note late Monday. Patrick Seitz for Investor’s Business Daily: ‎ Ives said he expects tech stocks to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors digest “a less regulatory spiderweb” under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Also, stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost, he said. Ives identified 10 stocks that he called “tech winners for the AI revolution in 2025.” AI chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) leads the list, followed by cloud computing giant and OpenAI partner Microsoft (MSFT). Rounding out the list are Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), MongoDB (MDB), Pegasystems (PEGA), Snowflake (SNOW), and Salesforce (CRM). ‎ MacDailyNews Take: 2025 will be the year when Apple Intelligence becomes fully formed!

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR)It's been a tough month for MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer turned bitcoin (BTC) accumulator. Its stock has tumbled almost 50% since November, when it joined the Nasdaq 100 index and peaked at a 600% gain since the start of the year. That still leaves the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company a whopping 342% ahead in 2024, the biggest return among the highest-profile crypto-linked assets in traditional finance (TradFi). It's been a volatile year, packed with geopolitical and technological developments to rattle financial markets. The continuing wars in eastern Europe and the Middle East, elections across the globe, the unwinding of the yen carry trade in August and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) have all left their marks. MicroStrategy's gain is almost double that of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker whose production of integrated circuits needed for AI applications fueled a 185% return, the best among the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks. The next best, Meta Platforms (META), turned in 71%. Bitcoin itself rose 100% in a year that included April's reward halving and multiple record highs. Demand for the largest cryptocurrency was driven by the January approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. Bitcoin outperformed two of its biggest competitors, ether (ETH), up 42%, and Solana (SOL), up 79%. Among the ETF's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also returned over 100% and became the fastest ETF in history to hit $50 billion in assets. Bitcoin mining companies, on the whole, disappointed. Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a proxy for mining stocks, rose just under 30%. That's despite demand for the miners' computing capabilities and power supply agreements from artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) companies. Still, individual companies benefited, in particular, Bitdeer (BTDR),which added 151%, and WULF (WULF), which gained 131%. Nevertheless, the miners' gains beat the broader equities market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) added 28% while the S&P 500 Index (SPX) rose 25%. The S&P 500 also trailed behind gold's 27% increase. The precious commodity has now topped the equity gauge in three of the past five years. Concerns about U.S. inflation and the country's budget deficit added to the geopolitical uncertainties to prompt a massive rise in U.S. treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction to price. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury added 15% to 4.5% over the course of the year, and surprisingly gained a full 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks bond prices, dropped 10% this year and has lost 40% in the past five years. The dollar, on the other hand, showed its strength. The DXY Index (DXY), a measure of the greenback against a basket of the currencies of the U.S.' biggest trading partners, rose to the highest since September 2022. West Texas Intermediate (USOIL), the benchmark oil price in the U.S., ends the year little changed, up less than 1% to around $71 a barrel. But it was a bumpy ride, with the price rising to almost $90 at some points in the past 12 months. As we head into the new year, all eyes will be on the debt ceiling discussion, the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and whether the U.S. can continue with its impressive growth story.

Title: Stocks just did something they haven’t done in nearly three decades | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US markets wrapped up a blockbuster 2024 by marking an achievement so rare that it’s only ever happened a handful of times. Despite US stocks closing lower Tuesday in a disappointing December that saw the Dow drop over 2,000 points, or about 5%, and the S&P 500 slide 2.5%, this was a stellar year for stocks. The S&P 500 gained more than 23% this year after rising 24% in 2023. The back-to-back gains of over 20% is the best performance for the benchmark index since 1997 and 1998, according to data from FactSet. It’s an extraordinary event for the modern-day version of the index. (Precursors also racked up that kind of performance three other times, in 1927 and 1928, 1935 and 1936 and in 1954 and 1955, according to a Bank of America analysis.) That means your retirement savings might be looking a little more cushioned than usual. Retirement plans in the form of a 401(k) or other pension fund are often invested in indices like the S&P 500. So, when stocks have a standout year, your account balance will benefit. Despite fizzling out in December and missing an expected “Santa Claus rally” to close out 2024, markets notched a blockbuster year, building off a strong 2023. Wall Street saw impressive returns this year as inflation cooled and consumer spending remained strong, while the job market proved solid but slowing. Investors were bullish on strong earnings growth for tech companies, and stocks surged following President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection in November. The blue-chip Dow index rose 12.9% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 28.6%. The S&P 500 is up by around 53% over the past two years, after a poor performance in 2022 that saw the index fall 20%. US markets have also outperformed stocks in Europe and Asia across this year. “Inflation is waning, interest-rate cuts are in motion and earnings are trending higher, all which bolster sentiment and provide valuation support,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. The consensus among big banks and research analysts appears to be continued growth into 2025 amid strong economic data, earnings growth and expectations of a business-friendly Trump administration. Analysts expect the S&P 500 to rise by 14.8% in 2025, according to FactSet. But some analysts say stocks are currently overvalued, and uncertainty over the speed of future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve as well as looming geopolitical risks could spark a selloff. With such eye-watering gains in the past two years, it is uncertain whether the bull market can last. “We believe the chances of another positive year in 2025 are favorable given the high probability of economic growth and a Fed that is likely to cut rates next year,” Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a December 30 note. “But if resurgent inflation takes rate cuts off the table or speculation gets out of hand, this bull market could have a difficult time making it through next year.” December was the worst month since April for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, according to data from FactSet, as selloffs in tech stocks dragged the indices lower. Indeed, it’s rare to see three straight years of 20% gains in the stock market, according to Callie Cox, chief ma﻿rket strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Everybody’s expecting a good year next year, and that leaves a lot of room for disappointment,” Cox told CNN. In September, the Fed began cutting interest rates after holding them at decades-highs since the summer of 2023. The combination of the Fed beginning to cut rates and strong economic growth boded well for US equities. Cooling inflation boosted investor optimism, but after its final policy meeting of the year, the Fed signaled there will be fewer cuts in 2025 than previously expected, which could sap the market’s momentum next year. S&P 500 index: US tech companies had a standout year and drove the S&P 500 23.3% higher. The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — have accounted for over 50% of the S&P 500’s total returns this year, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. And, since November 5, the Mag Seven stocks have accounted for over 96% of the S&P 500’s gains. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was a top performer of the year, surging 179%. While Big Tech stocks boosted gains, stock market breadth has been poor. Most companies in the S&P 500 have fallen since November, while the index has been helped by the Magnificent Seven’s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Dow Jones Industrial Average: The Dow gained 12.9% across the year. The blue-chip index peaked at a record just above 45,000 points on December 4 before falling 5% in December. American chipmaker Nvidia joined the Dow in November. Nasdaq Composite: The Nasdaq surged higher by 28.6% in 2024. The tech-heavy index was the star of the major indices and surged on investor confidence in tech and AI. Palantir (PLTR), the AI-focused data company whose stock rose almost 340% this year, joined the Nasdaq in December. US Treasuries: The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note edged to 4.57% on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose by over 15% in 2024, signaling expectations of future economic growth and inflation. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note slid to 4.232% on Tuesday. The US dollar rose near the end of the year on expectations of economic growth. The US dollar surged after Trump’s reelection in November. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, is up over 7.1% across the year, according to data from FactSet. Bitcoin slid to $93,400 around by 4 p.m. on Tuesday and was down nearly 4% for the month. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has had a memorable year, surging by about 120% across 2024. That’s a turn of fortune from just two years ago, when bitcoin traded below $17,000 after the crypto industry imploded. Bitcoin — which is highly volatile — rallied this year as it continued to garner mainstream acceptance through Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrencies. Trump has tapped Paul Atkins, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto advocate, to be SEC chair. After Trump announced his pick, bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time. Gold also had a notable year, rising by 27% and outpacing the S&P 500. Investors often see gold as a safe haven against economic turmoil and inflation. When the Fed cuts rates, gold can become more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Gold’s rally, however, was also driven as central banks around the world continued to increase their gold reserves. Commodities: Which investment yielded the most surprising returns this year? Cocoa. Cocoa futures on the New York exchange surged more than 168% across the year. Futures prices for cocoa skyrocketed as climate issues disrupted cocoa harvests in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, where over 70% of global cocoa is produced. The squeeze in supply sent futures prices soaring. Futures for coffee and orange juice also surged this year due to erratic climate and poor outlooks for harvests. Futures contracts are often traded by institutional investors like big banks or asset management firms, as opposed to individual investors.

Title: The AI stocks that could boom in 2025

Big Tech stocks could have another big year in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) could continue to be some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence-driven stock boom, David Dietze, senior portfolio strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management, said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia — “the granddaddy of them all,” as Dietze puts it — soared more than 170% this year, giving it a roughly $3.3 trillion market capitalization as it rides tremendous revenue growth and overwhelming demand for its AI chips. Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon, which is also getting in on the chip game, surged more than 50%. Google parent Alphabet stock rose 40%, and Apple climbed more than 35%. The Magnificent 7 — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for about a third of the S&P 500 index’s gains this year, largely powered by excitement around new AI technologies. But Goldman Sachs (GS) has warned that this “unusual degree of market concentration” could pose a major risk next year. Stocks that have benefited from the AI boom have largely done so independent of interest rates. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t in for a correction as the market settles from the post-presidential election rally. Dietze said that could happen in the not-so-distant future. “They’re riding a secular tailwind of extreme innovation that could plow right through that,” Dietze said. “Nevertheless, no sector operates in a silo or a vacuum. If everything else around them is struggling, they’re gonna struggle a little bit, too.” Dietze said one major theme for 2025 will be: show me the money. While major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have poured billions into AI partnerships and their own initiatives, investors are likely going to start looking for proof of returns next year, Dietze said. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday,” he said. “These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that.’” “And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year,” Dietze said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Driven mostly by Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Japanese producer Ibiden is looking at methods to boost manufacturing capacity to satisfy rising demand for chip substrates vital for artificial intelligence computers. CEO Koji Kawashima made the statement while in an interview with Bloomberg. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Based in Ogaki, Japan, Ibiden provides specialized substratesincluding powerful graphics processing units from Nvidiathat are vital for producing artificial intelligence chips. Strong orders have driven the business to investigate capacity increases because, according to Kawashima, demand is projected to stay high until next year. Ibiden is building a new manufacturing site in Gifu Prefecture to handle these demands. By late 2025 the plant will start running at 25% capacity; by early 2026 it will rise to 50%. Talks on complete operating capability to satisfy consumer expectations are still under progress. Kawashima underlined the need of increasing output to maintain customer satisfaction and said that customers had already asked about next projects. Although Nvidia continues to be a major client, Ibiden has broadened its portfolio of business to include firms engaged in advanced computing technology. Once the biggest source of income for Ibiden, Intel now accounts for less of revenues. While stressing the need of lowering dependence on any one customer, Kawashima pointed out the historical significance of the link with Intel. Though rising sales of AI-specific devices, Ibiden recently changed its profit projection due to declining demand for server-related components in non-AI applications. Kawashima voiced hope for overcoming these obstacles by means of strategic alliances and creativity. Citing logistical and labor cost issues, the corporation has decided against building manufacturing plants located in the United States. As competition in the AI chip industry rises, Ibiden expects to be offering a wider spectrum of customers ahead. From established companies like Nvidia to startups with unique silicon designs, Kawashima pointed out the company's flexibility in fulfilling changing market demands.

Title: NVIDIA Partner Super Micro Ends $50 Million Loan, Shares Fall

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI, Financials) ended a $50 million loan deal with HSBC's Taiwan unit, therefore creating even another level of financial difficulties for its operations. The business said that formally the loan, completely repaid on Sept. 9, was ended on Dec. 20. Reflecting investor uncertainty, Super Micro's shares fell 5% on the announcement. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Previously called the General Loan, Export/Import Financing, Overdraft Facilities, and Securities deal, the terminated deal provided credit to Super Micro's Taiwan affiliate. The company's future liquidity management comes under scrutiny as it has not stated intentions for a successor financing strategy. Amid these developments, Super Micro Computer keeps working with NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) to improve its position in the artificial intelligence sector while handling continuous financial review. Emphasizing its dedication to improving artificial intelligence technology, the business has revealed three NVIDIA-powered generative AI SuperClusters, aiming at corporate and big language model applications. Announced earlier this year, the SuperClusters seek to clear key AI process bottlenecks like GPU memory capacity and efficiency. The development emphasizes Super Micro's strategic dependence on NVIDIA technology to support its AI offers, a move experts see as essential to maintain its competitiveness in the fast changing tech scene. Super Micro struggles financially, however. The firm postponed publishing its annual report in August, under investigation by short-seller Hindenburg Research for claimed possible accounting mistakes. October saw an escalation in the matter as Ernst & Young left their post as auditor due to internal control issues. Super Micro hired BDO USA as its new auditor to handle these issues and submitted a compliance plan to Nasdaq, which gave the business an extension until February 2025 to record missing reports.

Title: Nvidia may be entering a 'limitless' era: Investor

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia's (NVDA) Teflon-like stock may be taking a few swipes as the year winds down, but a new chapter awaits the AI market darling — and with it more impressive quarters of growth, experts and investors believe. "Nvidia is printing money like Apple did in the early days of the iPhone," Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management president Ross Gerber said on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above), later adding, "the opportunity for AI is somewhat limitless at this point." Gerber, who has been an investor in Nvidia for the past decade after it rose to popularity for its high-performance gaming chips, thinks the company is entering its "next leg" of growth. The growth is to be fueled by rapid global buildouts of artificial intelligence infrastructure, powered in large part by Nvidia's leading-edge chips. "Nvidia is not a highly expensive stock, but it's not a cheap stock," Gerber said. "But the actual profits that they're driving and their monopoly position in the chip business just puts the next five years looking really good for Nvidia." "I certainly wouldn't get off it now," he added. "So for investors, Nvidia needs to be a part of your portfolio just as much as Apple and Microsoft." The excitement around what lies ahead for Nvidia is captured in retail investor inflows. Nvidia has attracted $30 billion in retail investor inflows so far this year, according to data from Vanda Research. It makes Nvidia the most popular stock among retail investors in 2024, ahead of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), with $15.3 billion in inflows, and Tesla (TSLA), with $14.7 billion. Some traders have opted to get off the Nvidia rocket ship this month, however. Shares of the new Dow Jones Industrial Average component are up just 0.7% in the past month. The Dow is down 10% in the last month, while the S&P 500 has lost about 1.7%. Nvidia shares are still higher by 181% year to date. The stock is facing a soul-searching moment, according to Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya. This is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these [issues] are company-specific forces,” Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below), “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's Blackwell AI chip — which won Yahoo Finance's 2024 Product of the Year award — hasn't been seamless, Arya explained, and this has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” Arya said. Blackwell, which the company rolled out in March at its annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. However, bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Now Wall Street's gaze will shift to success toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025 in early January. Yahoo Finance data shows that sell-side analysts expect Nvidia to increase net sales by $65 billion year over year in 2025, with earnings per share more than doubling. "They're the only game in town," Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said on Opening Bid. The [AI] foundation starts with Nvidia. That is not changing." Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.
