Title: China Prepares to Wreck US AI Industry
URL: https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2025/12/18/china-prepares-to-wreck-us-ai-industry/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T15:15:49Z
Full Content:
Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © JohanSjolander / E+ via Getty Images The math is simple. It starts with three facts. China has spent massive amounts to create very low-priced electricity at a rate several times the U.S. pace. It has built massive dams. The best example is the Motuo Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. No other nation could build a colossal project so fast. And China has extraordinary solar power supply. Do the large Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies pay for these? No. The central government largely does. China is a dictatorship, so things happen that way. Next, China creates a science project like the one America did when we built the atomic bomb. The nation’s best scientists all work on one project: chips that rival those made by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). Reuters calls it China’s Manhattan Project. The news service reports, “Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance.” Much of the tech seems to have been “stolen” from Western companies. Finally, China creates extremely advanced AI products, like those from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and OpenAI, which it then dumps into the market. The latest versions include DeepSeek-V3.2, which anyone in the public can use, and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, which is more for tech business operations. Chen Fang, a Chinese engineer who worked on the project, said, “People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough, but we came back much bigger,” according to VentureBeat. The Chinese could be lying, but experts with access to the DeepSeek products don’t think so. The Chinese can employ huge numbers of top experts to move forward even faster. There is no competition for talent like there is among America’s tech companies. No engineer in China is being paid $10 million to move from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). China won’t allow it. rodenkoff / iStock via Getty Images It takes three years to build a data center in the United States, especially for large hyperscale projects. Ask Elon Musk. U.S. data centers face a scarcity of electricity as builders attempt to bring data centers online quickly. Renewable energy has not scaled fast enough. This has forced America to return to coal generation. Environmental activists are trying to stop that. In the U.S. AI data center builders will need hundreds of billions of dollars to build out infrastructure. That capital has to be raised somewhere. Tech companies and financial players are cobbling it together. Companies like Microsoft and Meta do not have enough capital to cover these expenses themselves. Blue Owl Capital just walked away from helping to fund an Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) data center project. Money is fickle. Nearby residents and businesses oppose U.S. data centers. Data center power use can drive up electricity prices. The grid in some areas is too weak to supply the power. And politicians are starting to make electricity prices an issue. That can slow or kill data centers in some parts of the country. The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, “An escalating artificial intelligence race between China and the U.S. is drawing comparisons to the Cold War, and is likely to be just as consequential.” What happens to the valuation of Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other sector leaders if China starts to pull ahead? It is similar to what people worry about with an AI bubble.

Title: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise

Full Content:
Bitwise predicted Bitcoin's volatility will stay below Nvidia's in 2026, citing institutional adoption and ETFs as drivers of the asset’s maturation. Bitcoin’s volatility appears to be diminishing, with its movements in 2025 more subdued than those of Nvidia (NVDA), which Bitwise says indicates its investor base is diversifying. Bitwise said on Wednesday that Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to be less volatile than Nvidia in 2026 as “Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined over the past ten years.” It added that the shift signals a “derisking” of the asset as its investor base has diversified due to the emergence of institutional investment products. Bitcoin has seen a 68% price change from its lowest level this year, when it fell to $75,000 in April, to its highest level, which was the all-time high of $126,000 in early October. Comparatively, Nvidia has seen more volatility with a 120% price swing from a low of $94 in early April to a 2025 high of $207 in late October. Shares in the chip giant have also outperformed Bitcoin this year and are up 27% year-to-date. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has fallen 8% since the beginning of this year as crypto markets have decoupled from stocks. Bitwise also made several bullish predictions for the coming year, including a new all-time high for Bitcoin and a break of the four-year cycle. “Forces like the Bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles,” it stated. Related: Bitcoin decouples from stocks in second half of 2025 It predicted that more traditional institutions like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch would enter crypto, allocations to spot crypto exchange-traded funds would increase, and onchain building would accelerate in 2026. Finally, the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate, Bitwise said. It also predicted that crypto equities will outperform tech equities.

Title: Billionaire With 30 Years of 30% CAGR Gains Dumped Nvidia, Palantir, and Eli Lilly

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks? Almost every hedge fund and ETF that tried to sidestep these stocks ended up lagging the market. Remember, Druckenmiller isn’t just any hedge fund manager. He has managed to do well with his top holdings being almost devoid of any AI software companies, with the only AI bet being Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Let’s take a look at his moves with these top AI companies he does not hold. Stanley Druckenmiller started adding Nvidia shares in late 2022, very early on after ChatGPT’s release. He bought in Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023. But starting in Q3 2023, he started shedding his NVDA stake. He sold for 5 straight quarters as NVDA stock climbed higher and higher. He sold his last NVDA share in Q3 2024, when NVDA stock reached nearly $135. The stock is at $178 today, so did Druckenmiller make a massive mistake? Likely not. His top 3 holdings today have done a lot better than Nvidia, and taking profits in 2024 and shifting into those were anything but a miscalculation. Druckenmiller likely identified that NVDA stock became too expensive for his liking and didn’t have comparable upside potential vs. the stocks he moved into. Druckenmiller has had an on-and-off relationship with Palantir. He sold over half his shares in Q3 2021, then bought in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Again, he sold for over a year straight from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023. He took a break from the stock before buying in Q1 2024, buying 770,000 shares before selling 94.6% of his shares (728,000) in Q3 2024. He sold whatever PLTR stock he had left in Q1 2025, presumably near the peak price of ~$120, as Palantir’s rally accelerated aggressively. PLTR stock has climbed up to $187.75 today. While he did miss out on Palantir’s gains since Q1, he took out big profits from Palantir and piled into what he saw as “safer” stocks with bigger upside. It would be out of order for an investor like Druckenmiller to pay an earnings multiple deep in the triple digits for PLTR stock. And this paid off. The top 3 stocks in his portfolio have all performed better than or equal to PLTR stock over the past 6 months. His biggest holding outperformed PLTR by over 2x, with the second-biggest holding outperforming it by nearly 3x (it is up 100% in the past 6 months). The third holding is essentially neck and neck with Palantir’s 35.8% performance. Druckenmiller has quite a long history with Eli Lilly, but we’ll be looking into transactions in the past 5 years. He bought for 3 straight quarters, in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022. Druckenmiller then took profits for 6 straight quarters from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024 as he shed all his LLY stock holdings as the company did exceedingly well. He made a hefty profit doing so, only to re-enter in Q4 2024 as LLY stock dropped from the $900s range to the $700s range. Druckenmiller bought for 3 straight quarters but then ended up selling it all in Q3 2025, equalling a sale of 101,000 shares in total. Q3 had an average closing price of $744.53. LLY stock has since recovered and is at $1,054 as of this writing. Druckenmiller likely grew impatient with this drawn-out recovery and didn’t want to stay in the loop with the company, especially with the uncertainty surrounding drug prices as the government got involved. And again, while he missed out on gains on LLY, his top holdings have delivered much more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Amazon Eyes a Big Investment in OpenAI. Is This the Latest Sign of an AI Bubble?

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:45:49Z
Full Content:
Amazon (AMZN) could be set to unveil an investment of $10 billion or more in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The companies are in talks for a deal that would see OpenAI buy some of Amazon's custom AI chips, and that would likely push OpenAI's valuation above $500 billion, according to a report from The Information and confirmed by CNBC. The talks reportedly started in October, after OpenAI completed its restructuring to a for-profit company with an agreement with Microsoft (MSFT), its largest investor, making it easier for OpenAI to seek funding from other companies. Amazon and OpenAI did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. A deal between Amazon and OpenAI would represent the latest in a string of big circular deals in the AI space, with major cloud and hardware providers investing in startups that also count them as suppliers. Such deals have exacerbated worries about an AI bubble, drawing parallels with the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. OpenAI has already signed over $1 trillion in agreements in recent months to buy chips and computing power. The startup struck massive chip deals Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and agreed to buy $38 billion in computing power from Amazon Web Services earlier this year. OpenAI's ChatGPT and other products don't currently generate enough revenue to cover those commitments, however, raising concerns the company may continue pulling in money from investors and lenders in the years to come before it turns a profit. Investors and analysts have grown increasingly skeptical in recent months of the growing number of circular deals within the AI industry, viewing them as unsustainable signals of a brewing AI bubble. Amazon shares were up less than 1% in recent trading, leaving them just 2% higher for the year so far and about 12% off their highs last month after a pullback in tech stocks in recent weeks.

Title: Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.
