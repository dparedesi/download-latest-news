getty Now that high inflation has subsided and interest rates are falling, you may be looking to reposition your portfolio for growth. Let's explore three sectors and six growth stocks that could deliver on your long-term wealth creation goals. For patient investors, long-term growth stocks have upside. First, long holding periods minimize trading fees. Lower taxes can also result, especially with growth stocks that aren't paying dividends. Additionally, long holding periods are easier to manage and can encourage higher returns. Investors who aren't timing the market don't have to monitor and evaluate every headline. They also don't have to feel anxious about market downturns. They can simply do nothing and wait for the market to recover. Most importantly, long-term growth stocks can produce real wealth through compound returns. Compounding happens when stock price gains begin appreciating. The gains-on-gains phenomenon escalates growth potential over time, without further contributions. Economic trends shape the future of the growth economy. Understanding those trends can help you focus your research on sectors that are most likely to expand. Currently, the outlook is strong for technology, healthcare and energy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting high job growth in these sectors based on three expected trends: Keeping the sector trends in mind, I identified six top growth stocks by screening U.S. public companies on these criteria: Combined, these qualities describe companies that have growth histories, strong outlooks, rising ROEs, manageable debt and the scale to absorb economic downturns. To finalize the best growth stock picks, I ordered the resulting list from the highest to lowest five-year EPS growth outlook. I then selected the top two from each of the targeted sectors.

Dynatrace operates a subscription-based technology infrastructure platform that monitors applications and microservices, protects against security vulnerabilities, logs analytics data and automates workflows to resolve security problems quickly. Dynatrace has customers around the world in financial services, retail, government, transportation and software. Statista reports that global spending on digital transformation—which is the business adoption of new technologies to enhance efficiency—reached $1.85 trillion in 2022. That represents 16% growth from the prior year. Enterprises undergoing digital transformation require better tools to optimize systems performance and prevent technology outages. Dynatrace is a top contender for that sizable market, which Insider Monkey has quantified at $50 billion. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, DT reported 20% constant-currency growth in annual recurring revenue versus the prior-year quarter. The company also increased its non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points to 29% and grew free cash flow by nearly 84%. Nvidia provides high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in AI, autonomous driving, 5G, robotics and gaming applications. Nvidia is fabless, meaning the company outsources manufacturing to focus on design and innovation. Nvidia has been an incredible growth story over the last two years, rising from a split-adjusted $16 per share to nearly $140. Today, the company holds an estimated 70% to 95% market share for AI chips. That is an enviable position because Gartner projects AI chip spending will increase from $53 billion in 2023 to nearly $92 billion in 2025. Second-quarter 2025 highlights from Nvidia, reported in August, include 154% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in its data center division and 168% growth in diluted EPS. The data center division encompasses sales of NVDA's AI-related solutions.

First Solar provides photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company's thin PV modules have a lower carbon footprint than conventional crystalline silicon PV panels. The International Energy Agency expects solar power to deliver 80% of the growth in global renewable energy capacity between now and 2030. Rooftop solar systems plus the construction of major solar power plants will contribute. First Solar is the largest U.S. producer of solar panels, primarily serving industrial applications. First Solar's share price dipped in early October after two analysts lowered their price targets. The analysts from Jefferies and Bank of America held their buy ratings on FSLR but noted a few short-term headwinds. These included potential supply chain issues, labor shortages and regulatory concerns. For long-term solar investors, this pullback probably creates a buying opportunity. First Solar's second-quarter earnings highlights, reported in July, included 25% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and a doubling of diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. Boston Scientific makes medical devices that diagnose and treat various conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, coronary artery disease and some forms of cancer. Customers include hospitals, clinics, medical offices and outpatient facilities around the world. At least four analysts have raised their price targets for BSX in recent weeks. One factor driving the excitement is Boston Scientific's planned early presentation of its transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) data. Analysts assume the expedited release signals confidence in the results of the company's study on its Acurate Transfemoral Aortic Valve System for TAVR. TAVR treats the narrowing of the aortic valve less invasively than open-heart surgery. Grand View Research has predicted the global TAVR market will grow at a CAGR of 7.2% between 2024 and 2030. Boston Scientific also recently closed on the acquisition of Silk Road Medical. The transaction is expected to be accretive to BSX's adjusted EPS in 2026 and beyond. In its second quarter 2024, Boston Scientific grew revenues by 14.5% and EPS by 22% from the prior-year period. Medpace is a clinical research organization that runs clinical trials for customers in the biotech, pharma and medical device industries. Customers are primarily small to mid-sized biopharma companies that do not have the resources required to run clinical trials in-house. The per-share price of Medpace has pulled back more than 20% since its earnings release in July. Analysts have also lowered their price targets. The good news is that these developments are related to temporary circumstances. Analysts are primarily concerned with slow biotech funding and deal flow, plus a decline in MEDP's bookings this year. UBS analyst Dan Leonard, as quoted by Business Insider, believes Medpace will grow faster than peers in the long term, even if the short-term pace is dampened by poor market conditions. In the second quarter 2024, Medpace grew revenue by 14.6%, backlog by 13.7% and diluted EPS by 42% versus the prior-year quarter. Schlumberger provides technology services for the oil and gas industry. From flow-rate measurement services to exploration data processing, the company's software and hardware solutions are designed to increase efficiency and streamline operations for oil and gas companies. As with Medpace, analysts covering Schlumberger have lowered price targets but remain bullish on the stock long term. A question mark in the immediate term is the outlook for oil prices. Falling oil prices could lessen production, which would be a headwind for Schlumberger. Despite analysts' reductions, the average price target on SLB still represents 42% upside. Schlumberger recently grew quarterly revenues by 13%, adjusted Ebitda by 17% and adjusted diluted EPS by 18% versus the prior-year period. You can maximize your portfolio's appreciation potential with growth stocks that operate within expanding economic sectors. Once you have those companies in your portfolio, stay patient and focused on the long term. Let compounding work its magic and it can deliver measurable increases in your net worth over time.

Title: What Are The Magnificent Seven Stocks?

Time Published: 2024-10-16T19:37:25Z

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services. Apple's product line includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch and various services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become a significant player in the cloud computing market, competing directly with Amazon Web Services. Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms. The company's flagship products include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. In recent years, Meta has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality technologies, signaling its ambition to lead the development of the "metaverse."

Nvidia, founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a technology company best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and professional markets. In recent years, Nvidia has become a significant player in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

Title: TSMC is making chips for Apple in the U.S.
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-make-a16-chips-apple-arizona-fab-ai-taiwan-semis-1851673965
Time Published: 2024-10-16T17:50:06Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+9.79%) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona. The chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. “The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL+0.17%) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. TSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan. It’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said. The Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility. The company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.43%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Jim Cramer has recently discussed the resilience of the "Magnificent Seven" and Netflix (NFLX, Financial) as the overall index continues to climb. Among these top performers are Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Alphabet(GOOGL, Financial), Apple (AAPL, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), Meta Platforms (META, Financial), and Tesla (TSLA, Financial). Cramer highlighted effective rebounds following recent dips. He specifically pointed to Nvidia and Apple as buy-and-hold opportunities due to their robust fundamentals despite share price volatility. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TSLA. Cramer expressed optimism about Apple's prospects in China, downplaying the skepticism around its operations there. However, he was more cautious about Alphabet, citing ongoing antitrust cases, yet he remained confident in its potential for a rebound. He praised Amazon's web services and Meta's robust advertising platform as critical drivers of their recent successes. Addressing the rumors affecting Microsoft's AI assistant, Cramer urged for more substantial evidence before dismissing the company's prospects. He also advised against betting against Tesla, noting Elon Musk's proven track record in navigating company controversies. He also mentioned that Netflix has yet to capitalize on its new advertising segment fully. Cramer characterized the current market movement as a tech rally that not only boosts its own sector but also elevates other market segments, aided by recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This marks a departure from previous rallies, suggesting a more supportive environment for widespread market growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

U.S. stock futures are little changed after Tuesday's tech selloff; ASML Holding (ASML) shares are continuing to move lower in premarket trading after the semiconductor-gear manufacturer's stock tanked yesterday as it reported third-quarter results a day earlier than expected; shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are rebounding slightly after stepping back from record highs as chipmakers struggled on industry worries; Stellantis (STLA) reports a 20% decline in Q3 worldwide shipments; and United Airlines (UAL) announces a $1.5 billion share buyback program as it reports better-than-expected earnings. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed in premarket trading Wednesday following a selloff yesterday on sharp declines for technology and energy shares. Crude oil futures are lower after Tuesday's decline amid easing tensions in the Middle East and news that the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its outlook for energy demand growth. Gold futures are higher. New York Registry Shares of ASML Holding (ASML) are declining a further 3% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker projected that its 2025 net sales would come in lower than previously projected. The company released its earnings report a day early on Tuesday, revealing a weaker-than-expected outlook, which sent its shares tumbling 16%. The company also reported third-quarter net bookings that were well below analyst estimates. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are up about 1% in premarket trading after the tech giant's shares fell nearly 5% Tuesday. Shares had reached an all-time closing high the prior session after bullish comments from analysts who cited the chipmaker's dominance in the accelerator market. Investors also were spooked yesterday by a report that the U.S. could curb AI chip sales to some Middle East countries. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also are rebounding slightly after dropping 5% Tuesday. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) reported shipments dropped 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, including a 36% decline in deliveries to North America amid high dealer inventory levels. The results come soon after the maker of Jeep and Chrysler issued a profit warning, citing "deterioration in global industry dynamics" and competition from Chinese rivals. Shares of Stellantis are edging higher in premarket trading. United Airlines (UAL) announced a $1.5 billion share buyback plan while reporting third-quarter earnings that were better than analyst estimates. The airline posted quarterly revenue of $14.84 billion, better than consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.33 also beat projections. United's results stand in contrast to the weaker-than-expected earnings from rival Delta Air Lines (DAL). Shares of United are up by more than 1% in premarket trading.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

US stocks were muted on Wednesday as investors digested results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all near flat at the open. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell showed fresh signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. Profits jumped compared to last year, thanks to a rise in dealmaking that has also lifted its peers. Shares rose more than 6% following the release. At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere. Abbott (ABT), Alcoa (AA), and Discover Financial Services (DFS) are on the docket on Wednesday. In commodities, gold (GC=F) rallied toward a fresh record high as fresh tariff promises from Republican nominee Donald Trump added to uncertainty around the outcome of the tight US presidential race. Morgan Stanley (MS) stock jumped 4% at the open after the company reported large year-over-year increases across a variety of metrics in its third quarter earnings release. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Fees from investment banking jumped 56% from a year ago, the largest leap among big banks, to nearly $1.4 billion. The pick-up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 32% from a year earlier, to $3.2 billion. The results cement a broad rebound across the Wall Street operations of the country's biggest banks. Investment banking fees and equity trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). Read more here.

Title: Tech is leading markets higher — but 3 other sectors have joined in: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings There's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company. Though the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees. More significantly, the so-called "fins" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5. All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%). It might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that "tech is leading" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the "Magnificent Seven." But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors. It's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, "Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market." Ralph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept. "Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next," said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading. Woods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs. "I hate that I like Cisco right now," Woods said. "I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing." In fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records. For that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively. Many of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found. "Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout," Woods said, adding, "[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore." On Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation, Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape, providing you with the critical context needed to make the right decisions for your portfolio.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+9.79%) (TSMC) is expected to beat revenue expectations for the third quarter when it reports quarterly earnings Thursday. The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.43%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%) and Apple (AAPL+0.17%) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple is losing out to Huawei in China. Here's why

Since releasing its Mate 60 Pro series last August, Chinese tech giant Huawei has made a comeback in China’s smartphone market, knocking Apple (AAPL+0.17%) from its pedestal. Huawei and other homegrown smartphone makers have experienced double-digit growth this year, boosting smartphone shipments in China by 8.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. China’s Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Honor — a former subsidiary of Huawei — and Xiaomi made up the top sharers of China’s smartphone market, respectively. Apple, meanwhile, fell to sixth place. And despite cutting prices on some iPhone models to compete, the data showed Apple’s year-over-year sales declined 3.1%. Apple’s iPhone shipments in China experienced “marginal decline” in the second quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research said, noting that during the same period last year, Apple had the third-highest number of shipments — only behind Oppo and Vivo — while Huawei was in sixth place. Apple’s fall in China can be tied to many factors, experts said, including the country’s faltering economy and changes in how its citizens view their country versus the rest of the world amid the pandemic and the growing number of sanctions imposed by the West. “There’s a higher degree of nationalist sentiment right now within China, of buying local and buying the home team versus buying an American product,” Arthur Dong, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz. Since Huawei was placed on the U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 under former President Donald Trump, the company has faced increasingly tough trade restrictions under President Joe Biden — especially on the latest generation of semiconductors such as those from Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%), Dong said. Escalating trade rules on China and Huawei are putting the tech company, which has ties to the Chinese government and which Dong called “a national champion for the Chinese economy,” “in a tough spot right now.” “Huawei is scrambling right now to try to find alternative sources for these all-important chips, as well as some very significant self-development efforts to try to replicate these technologies and build chips on their own,” Dong said. “With regard to that issue, China is having a really difficult time being able to replicate the chips that sort of fuel AI advancements simply because they don’t have access to the tools and the machinery that build these chips, all of which are within the confines of U.S. export controls.” Dong said he doesn’t see the current situation getting better for Huawei. With another round of restrictions expected over the next few months, the “gaps” that China and Huawei depend on to move around sanctions “are going to be closed,” he said. In the early 2010s, Apple was seen as a “legitimate, ultimate symbol of status,” Andy Tsay, professor of business and analytics at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, told Quartz. Tsay, who is also a visiting professor in Peking University’s MBA program, said his friends in China would “place their orders” with him for iPhones because Apple’s products were more difficult to find there and there were shortages. Now, there are more Apple Stores in the country. “There really was no comparison, no competitor,” Tsay, who has visited China roughly every year since 2006, said. “Now, people still think Apple is a fine and legitimate luxury product. But the difference is, they’re not fanboys and fangirls anymore.” On his most recent visit to China a few months ago, Tsay asked his MBA students, part of China’s professional class, what they thought about their iPhones. While his students told him that they are satisfied with their iPhones, they also said their next phone “won’t necessarily be an Apple,” and that “there are some Chinese options that are pretty good.” “I’ll get whichever phone has the best price-to-benefit ratio,” Tsay’s students told him. In 2020, Huawei had 18% of the world market for smartphones, Dong said. Two years later, that number fell to 2%, largely because Huawei was restricted from necessary chips and components, he said, and he doesn’t see the company rebounding soon. “They’re still facing challenges in the Chinese market because the overall consumer economy of China has gone into a tailspin,” Dong said. “Apple’s problems are mostly related to the fact that the Chinese consumer has gone into hibernation and they can’t afford this kind of phone because their entire economy is, in a sense, collapsing.” Huawei’s growing sales are “only because their phones are a lot cheaper than Apple’s phones,” Dong said. If Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are offering cheaper alternatives, consumers will want those smartphones, he added. China is “more isolated” than it was during its superpower status in the 2010s, Tsay said, likely due to anti-Chinese sentiments stemming from the pandemic. Meanwhile, companies are “trying to extricate themselves from being too reliant on China,” and Western governments continue to ban China’s access to certain technologies, such as equipment to build advanced semiconductors. “You combine that all together with the rise of domestic products, and if people, locally, can feel a little bit good about themselves by supporting the home team, there’s a little bit of something in the trend,” Tsay said. There are two views of the AI chips in Huawei’s smartphones, Dong said. “On the one hand, it could send us an alarming signal that China has the ability to create their homegrown chips,” Dong said. “But there are other stories that you will see where these chips have been examined and the engineering analysis on them is that they’re not even close to the capabilities of what Nvidia is producing — that it’s actually several generations and years behind.” Despite Huawei’s “headline-grabbing” announcements about developing its own chips, Dong said he finds it difficult to imagine how the company has made its advanced chips without access to critical machines and components under trade restrictions. “This is perhaps more bark and less bite when it comes to this announcement that they have advanced-level chips,” Dong said. The competition between Apple and Huawei in China is also tied to the difference in what Apple can offer its U.S. consumers versus its Chinese consumers, Tsay said. Apple’s advantage in the U.S. is its control over its ecosystem, according to Tsay, allowing it to deliver a differentiated user experience. China, however, has a “unique situation” where its “version” of Apple’s iOS is WeChat. “You almost don’t need the tightly integrated, walled garden of the Apple ecosystem in China to deliver that experience because it already exists inside the WeChat world,” Tsay said. “That gives the local cell phone companies an advantage in the sense that they can use Android or their own version of Android or a brand new operating system — they don’t need to create that self-contained ecosystem that Apple has so painstakingly created over the years because Tencent (TCEHY-1.90%) already did it for them by creating WeChat.” The one place the two companies differ, Tsay said, is with Apple’s security and privacy features. “Of course, nobody in China has any expectation of security and privacy when they are online,” he said.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Retreats From Record

Time Published: 2024-10-16T02:32:16Z

Nvidia (NVDA) shares will likely remain on investors’ radar screens after falling sharply Tuesday, just a day after setting a record closing high. The decline Tuesday came as Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is mulling AI chip export curbs to some Middle Eastern countries. The news tempered optimism about surging demand for Nvidia's chips from tech giants hyperscaling their AI infrastructure amid a backdrop of tight supply. Nvidia shares fell 4.7% Tuesday to close at $131.60. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors will likely be watching. Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle between June and September before breaking out above the pattern earlier this month. Although the breakout signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend, it’s worth pointing out that the move occurred on below-average volume, indicating a lack of conviction behind the move. Conversely, Tuesday’s selling registered the highest daily share turnover in nearly a month, raising the possibility of a potential bull trap, a trading event that lures investors into buying a breakout before the price makes a sudden reversal. Let’s take a look at three important support levels on the AI chipmaker’s chart and also use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH). The first sits around $125, where the shares find a confluence of support from the symmetrical triangle’s top trendline and a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between early June and late September. A decisive breakdown below this level would confirm a bull trap, which could trigger a move down to the $115 level, where the stock may encounter buying interest near the triangle’s lower trendline and multiple minor peaks and troughs stretching back to late May. Further selling could see the shares revisit major support around $97, a location on the chart currently just below the upward sloping 200-day moving average (MA) where investors could look for buying opportunities near the twin March peaks and prices situated just above the August low. Investors can forecast a bullish price target above the stock’s ATH by using a measured move, also referred to by chartists as the measuring principle. This works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s trendlines near the start of the pattern and adding that amount to the breakout point. In other words, we add $50 to $127, which projects a price target of $177. The forecast, around 34% above Tuesday’s close, indicates a potential area on the chart where investors may be happy to lock in profits.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds. “We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.” Cramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding. “This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.” For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Talking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips: “They are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn’t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.” Cramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing: “I’ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.” Nvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Semiconductor stocks fell Tuesday after ASML slashed guidance for next year, and as the sector mulled reports that the US was weighing a cap on chip exports from some American companies. ASML, Europe's most valuable tech company, plunged 16% in its biggest single-day drop since 1998. Other chip stocks followed, with NVDA dipping almost 5%, AMD falling 5.3%, and Broadcom tumbling 3.5% around midday Tuesday. SMCI, meanwhile, fell as much as 3.4% earlier in the day before paring most losses. The industry's downturn comes after ASML, a Dutch chip machine maker, posted a downbeat earnings report and cut its sales guidance for next year. The report's forward guidance lowered total net sales for 2025 to between €30 billion and €35 billion, the lower half of the previously stated range, citing weak demand from chipmakers for its machinery. "It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected. This is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness," CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement. ASML's third quarter bookings were €2.6 billion, coming in under half the average estimate of €5.39 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. The report was posted a day earlier than expected, adding to the surprise of the results and lower guidance. Flows into AI stocks slowed over the summer as investors expressed worries about returns on huge spending on AI. Investment in the sector has rebounded in recent weeks, though, propelling Nvidia to a fresh high on Monday to help the S&P 500 hit another record close. Reports that the US is weighing a cap on chip exports from American chipmakers only compounded the industry's tumultuous start to the week. According to Bloomberg, the Biden administration has been in talks to cap sales of advanced AI chips from some American chip companies—including Nvidia—to certain countries in order to protect national security. The plans would likely target Persian Gulf countries, which are increasingly interested in AI, sources told the outlet, and would build on existing restrictions that originally set out to curb China's progress in AI. Previously implemented restrictions have regulated chip shipments to over 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to prevent chip technology from flowing to China.

The Dow and other major indexes experienced losses Tuesday afternoon as chipmakers struggled amid news of potential export caps. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 118 points, or 0.28%, to 42,939. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML+2.48%) plummeted following the company’s disappointing third-quarter bookings and a downward revision of its 2025 guidance. During afternoon trading, ASML’s stock dropped by more than 16%, reflecting investors’ concerns about the company’s outlook. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” ASML is the only company in the world that makes the equipment needed for advanced chip manufacturing, and nearly half of ASML’s revenue for the second quarter came from sales to China. However, due to export restrictions from the U.S. and the Netherlands, the company is now facing a more challenging business outlook in China. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD+0.07%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Among major semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.07%) fell by 4.9%, Micron Technology (MU+2.54%) declined by 3.5%, and Broadcom (AVGO+2.68%) decreased by 3.5% on Tuesday. –Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) ended at an unprecedented high on Monday, bringing it within close distance of Apple (AAPL,Financial) as the most valuable company in the world. The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Earlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months. Indeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field. Nvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165. Before the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500. As we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data. Still, there is some wariness regarding the further stable growth of AI spending. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell from yesterday's all-time closing high, and shares of other chipmakers declined, following indications the Biden administration is considering limiting the export of artificial intelligence chips to some countries in the Middle East. Bloomberg reported that White House officials have discussed putting a cap on export licenses to certain nations because of national security concerns. The focus was on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing interest in AI and the funding to purchase those technologies, the report said, adding that the discussions are in the early stages. Also weighing on semiconductor stocks was a warning from chipmaker equipment ASML Holding (ASML), which released its third quarter earnings a day earlier than expected. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover," said CEO Christophe Fouquet. "It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” ASML predicted 2025 sales of EUR30 billion to EUR35 billion ($32.7 billion to $38.1 billion), which is in the lower half of the range of its previous guidance. New York-traded shares of ASML sank some 16%, pulling them into the red for the year. The PHLX index of semiconductor stocks fell more than 4%. Nvidia's shares were down nearly 5%, though they remain up more than 160% in 2024. TradingView

Title: Nvidia stock tumbles from record high on news of possible US chip export cap, ASML's dismal earnings

Nvidia (NVDA) stock sank 4.5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before. The stock's tumble began before the market opened in response to a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell on the news. Intel declined to comment on the report. Nvidia and AMD did not immediately respond to requests from Yahoo Finance. "While NVDIA has not disclosed its sales to the Gulf region, the level of investment in AI from that region has been very substantial," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. "More importantly, if the government continues to narrow the geographies chip companies can sell into, they are significantly narrowing the market for AI services for NVDIA customers Microsoft, Google and Amazon." Adding to the woes of chip stocks Tuesday was a dismal earnings report from semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML). The Dutch company — which sells equipment to Nvidia's chip manufacturer TSMC as well as Intel — reported booking orders worth just €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter, far lower than the €5.39 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 5.3% Tuesday, far underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which was down 0.7% at market close. Nvidia’s decline Tuesday partially reverses a two-week winning streak that saw the stock rally to a new record closing price Monday, nearly eclipsing Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street’s most valuable company. Shares closed above $138 Monday, ahead of its previous record of $135.58 in June. Nvidia's tear was fueled by industry leaders' comments about intense demand for its AI chips and renewed bullishness over AI. Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector — which Nvidia leads — has pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year — when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips — before extending its historic rally. Despite Tuesday’s decline, Nvidia shares are up 190% from last year. While demand for its AI chips is strong in the near term, a potential slowdown in AI spending by Big Tech companies is another cause for concern to investors, in addition to geopolitical risks. DA Davidson's Gil Luria recently told Yahoo Finance that AI spending could ease as soon as 2025, which would be bad news for Nvidia shares. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Alibaba Still Has Room to Run: How China’s Stimulus Drives Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/10/15/alibaba-still-has-room-to-run-how-chinas-stimulus-drives-growth/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T15:57:41Z

By Muslim Farooque Summary Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Financial) has been on a superb run over the past six months, gaining upwards of 49% in value. After a sluggish phase from late 2020 through 2023, Alibaba stock is finally hitting its stride, showcasing healthy momentum as it climbs back to its pre-pandemic highs. Naturally, with its impressive rally, many are concerned about whether Alibaba stock has run too far. Given the tailwinds in play, spearheaded by the likely boost from China's massive stimulus plan, there still appears to be significant growth potential for the stock ahead. The dramatic shifts in China's monetary policy of late, led by unexpected interest rate cuts and a dovish stance, have fueled a superb rally in Chinese equities. Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China, announced sweeping economic measures, including reducing the 7-day reverse repo rate from 1.7% to 1.5%. With a firmer commitment to rejuvenating China's economic landscape, Chinese stocks have been running hot of late. In fact, Chinese stocks recorded their highest gains since 2008 in the past couple of weeks. The SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC SPDR S&P China ETF ), for instance, has outperformed the S&P 500 by a sizeable margin. Over the past month, GXC stock has climbed more than 20%, comfortably beating the S&P 500's gain, showcasing its sustained bullish momentum in response to the economic stimulus. Consequently, analysts are finally bullish on Chinese stocks. David Chao of Invesco Asset and Raymond Chen from ZiZhou Investment Asset Management expects strong fiscal measures to sustain the rally. Additionally, Laura Wang of Morgan Stanley sees a potential 10% short-term gain for the CSI 300 Index, indicating a marked shift in market sentiment, primarily due to the recent economic stimulus. Since November 2020, when the Chinese government initiated a rigorous regulatory crackdown on major tech companies, Chinese tech stocks have been suppressed. Following the high-profile suspension of Ant Group's IPO, the landscape from 2020 to 2023 marked a major cooling period for the sector, marked by a focus on antitrust, data security, and financial regulations. However, the recent economic changes aimed at stabilizing the Chinese property industry signal a pivotal shift. These interventions will likely alleviate major economic pressures, boost business conditions, and increase consumer spending power. Moreover, as we head toward late 2024, the strategic focus on economic revitalization could potentially lead to superb gains for Chinese stocks, especially Alibaba. It's important to note that from September 2014 to January 2020, Alibaba stock experienced a remarkable rise of 122%, hitting a high of $231. This period marked a golden era of growth for Chinese tech, supported by expansionary supportive government policies. Alibaba has quickly become one of the top AI players, arguably the biggest long-term catalyst in driving the company's growth and enhancing its global footing. Through its Qwen AI model, it has cemented its position as one of the giants in the international AI landscape, going head-to-head with top models like OpenAI's GPT and others. Furthermore, the tech giant's recent partnerships with industry bellwethers like Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and Mastercard (MA, Financial) showcase its AI-powered capabilities, including autonomous mobility. The integration of its AI model with Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin platform, perhaps one of the most promising future sectors, bolsters its appeal as an AI play. Also, Qwen's link to AliAlibaba's own mammoth platforms like Taobao and DingTalk, each with north of 600 million active users, underscores the powerful, robust infrastructure Alibaba has built to support its AI-driven services. Most recently, the company released more than 100 open-source AI models, having released its powerful text-to-video tool at its Apsara Cloud event. Also, a potential partnership with Apple to integrate AI adds new layers to Alibaba's growth story, fortifying its credentials in the niche. Hence, the company's comprehensive AI strategy isn't just about its current operations but is also strategically positioning it for substantial future growth. Despite some inconsistency in top-line growth over the past few years, Alibaba's robust profitability numbers continue to impress. Alibaba Profitability Rank As depicted in the visual, Alibaba attracts a superb 8 on 10 rating from GuruFocus, underscoring its robust bottom-line health compared to sector benchmarks. Starting with its gross margin stands at an impressive 37.9%, highlighting its ability to maintain healthy profits relative to sales. Moreover, its operating margin is solid at 12.12%, indicating efficient management operations despite operating in a competitive landscape. However, its net margin stands at 7.36% while its ROA is at 3.9%, suggesting that while Alibaba is profitable, there are areas where it needs to step up its game with regard to efficiency in turning assets into net income. Also, its FCF margin of 18% is commendable, reflecting robust cash generation capabilities that remain critical in sustaining operations and funding future expansions. Moreover, Alibaba's ROC ( Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio)) is at 57.3%, dramatically outperforming many of its competitors, highlighting its effectiveness in generating returns from capital investments. Additionally, with 10 consecutive years of profitability, Alibaba's financial stability has shielded it from previous crises, positioning it to thrive in the competitive landscape. A huge part of Alibaba's margin growth has been the expansion of its Cloud business, which is emerging as a key growth engine for Alibaba. Despite a challenging retail environment in China and a brief dip in cloud sales last year, the integration of advanced AI technologies has revitalized this segment, driving a strong rebound in recent results. Alibaba Cloud Revenue From the chart above we can see that Alibaba Cloud has shown impressive growth over the years, as shown by its revenue trajectory from 2018 to 2023. Despite a sizeable dip in 2023, the cloud division's rapid expansion from $2,135 million in 2018 to a peak of $11,763 million in 2022 highlights its expanding influence within Alibaba. Moreover, as per recent financials, Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Group contributes significantly to sales, which accounts for 11.3% of the pie, underscoring the cloud sector's expanding influence. Alibaba Income Statement Breakdown Chart Also, from the graphic above, it's clear that the company draws sales from an array of sources. Though it still generates the lion's share of sales from Taobao and Tmall Group at 46.2%, other segments collectively contribute over 30%, which is imperative in stabilizing the company's financials against sector-specific downturns while helping to capitalize on multiple growth avenues. In its most recent showing in Q2 2024, Alibaba Cloud grew superbly, with segment-wise revenue reaching $3.64 billion, marking a 6% increase YOY. This growth is propelled by AI-driven products, reflecting a powerful demand in the AI sector, which Alibaba is tapping into. Also, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu emphasized the pervasive impact of AI on the cloud division's future, projecting double-digit growth in the latter half of 2024. Hence, the substantial investments in AI and cloud infrastructure that Alibaba has been making signal its intent to accelerate this momentum, ensuring its competitive edge in a fast-evolving digital landscape. Alibaba's stock performance has demonstrated superb gains over the past year, with stellar gains across various timeframes. Over the past month and three months, Alibaba has achieved healthy returns of more than 27% and 47%, respectively, outpacing its competition in PDD and MELI over the short term. Despite the challenges over the past three to five years, the tailwinds propelling Alibaba suggest it is positioned excellently to maintain its growth and continue delivering substantial returns for its investors. Alibaba Annualized Return Comparison Table Furthermore, based on the 12-month price target chart for Alibaba points to a consensus target of $108.40, with a potential increase of 2.15%. It's important to note that projections range significantly, with a $146 high estimate and a low of $79.70. Despite the volatility expected in Alibaba stock, I expect favorable market tailwinds to continue driving more upside as optimism in Chinese equities continues moving from strength to strength. Alibaba Analyst Price Targets Furthermore, if we look at the value of Alibaba stock based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, we see that there's still plenty of upside left in the stock. The DCF analysis is based on the company's TTM free cash flow (FCF) per share, projecting a fair value of $146.07, which is significantly above the current stock price. This indicates a margin of safety of more than 26%. Additionally, the model includes key variables including a 10% discount rate, reflecting the risk and time value of money. Also, the analysis is broken down into the growth and terminal stages. For the growth stage, a 10-year period is assumed with an annual growth rate of 8.3%, which amounts to a growth value of $86.28. For the terminal stage, also spanning 10 years, a lower growth rate of 4% results in a terminal value of $59.8. Given the sizeable margin of safety, there is hefty opportunity for capital appreciation, which shows that Alibaba stock's current price may not fully reflect its future cash flow potential, making it an attractive value investment. Alibaba DCF Model Chart Despite the run-up in value, I expect Alibaba stock to continue rising in value on the back of multiple tailwinds. Perhaps the biggest boost the stock is centered around China's economic stimulus measures, that led to a broader rally in Chinese equities. Moreover, Alibaba's inroads in the AI realm and cloud business expansion bolster its growth prospects further. Also, despite past challenges, Alibaba will likely continue sustaining its momentum with key drivers like cloud growth, AI innovations, and higher consumer spending. Also, a DCF analysis based on realistic assumptions points to a fair value of $146.07, implying a strong margin of safety and capital appreciation potential. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Investor sentiment sees biggest jump since June 2020 but offers a sign of caution

Investor sentiment saw its largest jump in nearly four years during October amid resilient economic data and the start of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In Bank of America's October Global Fund Manager Survey, investor sentiment rose to a reading of 5.6 from 3.8, marking its largest one-month increase since June 2020. The broad measure of sentiment takes into account investors' allocations to cash and equities as well as their economic growth expectations. Allocations to bonds and cash plunged in October, according to BofA's survey, as investors appeared more confident in the economic outlook. The drop in cash allocations fell to a level that BofA noted is often a near-term "sell signal." But when looking at other broad measures, the firm's "big sell signal" hasn't been triggered yet. The survey of 195 global participants was conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 10. The first day of responses was on the same day the blowout September Jobs report helped quell recession fears. Just 8% of respondents said they see a "hard landing" for the global economy over the next 12 months. That marked the lowest level of respondents fearing a situation where restrictive central bank policy leads to an economic downturn in four months. The optimism from investors reflects the recent market action. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) have both surged, hitting several record highs, including closing at all-time highs on Monday. Artificial intelligence market leader Nvidia (NVDA) closed at its first record high since June on Monday. More speculative areas have rallied too, with cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) both gaining more than 5% on Monday. Tuesday's Bank of America Survey did come with a sign of caution though, as hyper-optimistic investors can sometimes be considered a sign of a near-term top in the market. Cash allocations among respondents fell to 3.9% in October. Bank of America noted that any reading under 4% can be considered a "sell signal." Since 2011, the worldwide equity index iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) has declined by 2.5% on average in the one-month period following sell signals and fallen 0.8% over the next three months, per BofA. Still, there are plenty on Wall Street who think optimism among investors has further to run before the current bull market rally hits a true bump in the road. "We are in 'goldilocks zone', where investors are rightly trying to pick winners and avoid losers but are not so optimistic that they have thrown caution to the wind," DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday when making the case for the stock market rally to keep rising higher.

Title: Nvidia stock falls over 4% on news that U.S. could cap exports

Time Published: 2024-10-15T15:03:00Z

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD+0.07%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Earlier this year, U.S. officials started slowing down the issuing of licenses to Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. chipmakers for shipping large-scale AI accelerators to the Middle East, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, Dell (DELL+1.95%) plans to ship computer servers with Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips to select customers starting next month, with general availability slated for the start of next year, Arthur Lewis, president of Dell’s infrastructure unit, told Bloomberg. Dell’s rollout shows production of Nvidia’s highly-anticipated Blackwell chips is on track after reports of delays earlier this year. Nvidia’s shares have experienced some turbulence in recent months. In August, the chipmaker’s shares fell about 13% in pre-market trading after a report that its Blackwell chips were delayed due to design flaws. Still, Nvidia’s stock is up around 173% so far this year, and it remains the second-most valuable public company after Apple (AAPL+0.17%). The company’s shares climbed 2.4% and closed at a record $138.07 on Monday, beating its previous record close of $135.58 on June 18 — a week after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. During Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings in August, CEO Jensen Huang said the company had shipped samples of Blackwell chips to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. Earlier this month, Nvidia’s stock rose after chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The U.S. reportedly could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries, including those in the Middle East. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia (NVDA+0.92%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.07%), citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Biden administration’s focus is reportedly on countries in the Middle East that have started pouring billions into AI data centers. A ceiling on export licenses would follow the Commerce Department’s recent expansion of its license exceptions to include data centers. The license exception makes it easier for U.S. companies to send AI chips to countries building data centers in the Middle East. Earlier this year, U.S. officials started slowing down the issuing of licenses to Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. chipmakers for shipping large-scale AI accelerators to the Middle East, Bloomberg reported. U.S. officials were also reportedly carrying out a national security review of AI technology being developed in the region. Nvidia and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for export controls, both declined Quartz’s request for comment. AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In June, Saudi Arabia announced its National Semiconductor Hub to develop semiconductor companies that can design new chips. The kingdom said it wants to attract 50 firms to Saudi Arabia by 2030. However, the hub is currently focused on simple chips, not advanced chips for AI and military technology, Bloomberg reported. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which has investments in U.S. tech startups, has set aside $40 billion to invest in AI technology, the New York Times reported earlier this year. The fund is reportedly working with top U.S. investors, including Andreessen Horowitz. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stock futures are little changed Tuesday, a day after the Dow and S&P 500 set fresh record highs and investors await a slew of corporate earnings reports; shares of chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are dropping on a report that U.S. regulators are looking to curb sales of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chips to some Middle East countries; Bank of America (BAC) third-quarter earnings come in ahead of estimates; Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google says it will back construction of small nuclear plants by a startup in a bid to meet AI power demands; and Apple Q3 smartphone sales grow following its iPhone 16 release. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed Tuesday, a day after the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average set fresh record highs as tech stocks helped lead gains. After several big banks reported better-than-expected earnings last week, investors will get another slate today, including from Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Bond markets will return to trading today after being off for the Columbus Day federal holiday Monday. After hitting an all-time closing high yesterday, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are pulling back less than 1% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report that the U.S. is weighing curbs on exports of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to some countries. The sales cap would likely be targeted toward countries in the Middle East and comes as U.S. regulators are working to ease the licensing process for shipments to data centers in that region, the report said. The news sent shares of other chipmakers lower as well, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Bank of America (BAC) shares are rising more than 2% in premarket trading after it reported third-quarter results above analysts' estimates. The lender posted $25.34 billion in revenue, above last year's $25.17 billion, and profit that fell to $6.90 billion from $7.80 billion—a smaller drop than the consensus projection of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Bank of America joined rivals JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in reporting better-than-expected Q3 results. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it would back the construction of nuclear power plants as the tech giant looks for power sources for its AI services. Google will buy power from startup Kairos Power, which is planning to generate 500 megawatts of power, with the reactor slated to be online by 2030, followed by others through 2035. The arrangement comes as tech firms search for additional energy sources to power AI data centers, with Microsoft (MSFT) recently announcing it would restart a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island to help meet power needs. Google shares are rising less than 1% in premarket trading. Sales of Apple (AAPL) smartphones rose in the third quarter following the release of its AI-enabled iPhone 16 last month, according to a report from International Data Corporation. Industry tracking data showed that iPhone sales were higher by 3.5% year-over-year, with sales strong for both older models and the latest iPhone release, with the company maintaining a steady market share of 17.7%, IDC said. Apple's 56 million worldwide shipments weren't enough to make it the top seller, though, as Samsung delivered 57.8 million phones to capture 18.3% of the smartphone market. Apple shares are about 1% higher in premarket trading.

Title: How To Play China’s New Stimulus Package With Closed-End Funds

Made in China. When I show you a chart like the one below, your first thought might be that we’re looking at, say, the recent stock performance of NVIDIA (NVDA)—or maybe a biopharma firm that just dropped a breakthrough treatment: MCHI Total Returns But you’d be wrong. What we’re looking at here is the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), an index fund tracking the Chinese stock market, up to its peak early last week. That jump is the direct result of the Chinese Communist Party’s recently announced stimulus package. The gains have attracted the attention of Chinese day traders and speculators, as well as those in the West. But—as is often the case with China’s economic moves—there’s still a lot of uncertainty here, as the Chinese government has given few details on what, exactly, it will do. That lack of detail caused a reversal late last week that has dented, but not shattered, the bullish view. So how do us non-day traders profit from this situation? The obvious way is to buy Chinese stocks—but there’s a big risk here, since foreigners can’t do this directly. There are ways around this, such as buying US-listed firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA). But that adds risk, since stocks like these don’t actually give you ownership in Chinese companies. This all may sound surprising if you don’t follow Chinese stocks regularly, but Alibaba and other US-listed Chinese stocks are actually tied to something called a variable interest entity that’s registered in the Cayman Islands. So buying Alibaba isn’t just a bet on Chinese stimulus but also on Chinese regulators respecting international law and recognizing foreign investors’ real claim in Chinese firms. Another way to buy in is through an ETF like MCHI, which invests broadly in Chinese assets, and hope you can get out before this short-term frenzy stops. However, MCHI and ETFs like it aren’t your only option, nor are they even a particularly good one. The real problem with Chinese stocks is that, while short-term wins on a frenzy like this are possible, the Chinese market’s long-term performance has been, to put it frankly, dreadful. MCHI Lags Chinese stocks have returned around a tenth of the S&P 500’s gains, so an investor who bought $10,000 of US stocks in 2011 would have $56,120 as of this writing, while the same amount in Chinese stocks would now be $13,026, leaving over $40,000 on the table. The key takeaway here is that if you want to play this frenzy, don’t stick around long, or you’ll miss bigger returns elsewhere. But if you’re still determined to give it a try, MCHI isn’t the best way to do so. To explain this, let’s look at the Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund (CAF), a closed-end fund (CEF) that, like MCHI, invests in Chinese companies. CAF Lags As you can see, CAF is underperforming MCHI this year, and the pullback in the wake of the big spike we talked about off the top has been much worse for the CEF than it has been for the ETF. So why would an investor looking to profit off the Chinese stimulus package pick CAF? The answer is in the question itself. The frenzy has pushed up MCHI, the largest ETF by market cap tracking the Chinese stock market, but it still hasn’t spread to smaller, less-popular Chinese funds. And since CAF, with just a $275-million market cap, is about one-twentieth the size of MCHI, it’s probably going to remain a hidden gem of Chinese stock-market frenzy for a while longer. That may sound speculative. After all, how can I know that CAF isn’t getting as much attention as MCHI? Well, beyond its lagging performance, there’s the discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of CAF’s underlying portfolio): CAF Discount NAV Let’s start with the purple line above: MCHI trades at a 0.6% premium to NAV as of this writing. That shouldn’t happen. Typically, market pros look for opportunities to sell an ETF trading at a premium and buy the fund’s underlying assets, as doing so gives them instant profit. This is why big index funds, like S&P 500 ETFs, always trade close to par. This premium tells us that the difficulty of getting real shares in Chinese companies has made this arbitrage opportunity tough for all but the biggest investors. That should encourage more speculators to buy CAF, with its 17.2% discount (discounts to NAV are common with CEFs, since their shares are mostly fixed in number, while the value of the assets their shares represent fluctuates during trading hours). Bear in mind, too, that CAF is trading at a similar discount to where it was before the trading frenzy. That means CAF doesn’t have the big China stimulus–driven recovery priced in, while MCHI does. Of course, buying CAF means you’ll need to be active, vigilant and ready to sell at a moment’s notice. But that’s all part of day trading. This is also why we prefer a longer-term, dividend-focused approach at my CEF Insider service (as well as downplaying or avoiding Chinese stocks). After all, when there are CEFs from across the economy (and the world) yielding 8%+ on average, there’s just no need to take on the stress and workload of day trading.

Title: Nvidia and other chip stocks surge with no sign of AI spending slowdown — for now

Nvidia's (NVDA) record close on Monday comes as AI hardware stocks continue a recent tear fueled by investor enthusiasm over surging artificial intelligence demand. Nvidia shares are up 8% from last week, pushing the chipmaker closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable company. The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for the company's AI chips. Other AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products, thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday. All in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.5% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 2.9% over the same time frame. The upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment. "While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI infrastructure-related stocks, such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect," Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10. Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech companies are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. OpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.” A slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when. Whereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases. Indeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending. “We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose again Monday in the wake of bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. The stock gained 2.4% to finish at a record closing high of $138.07 and has nearly tripled in value this year, as demand for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI) has surged. Shares are just shy of their intraday high of $140.76 set in June. Several stocks with ties to the chipmaker, including partners Arm Holdings (ARM), TSMC (TSM), and Nvidia-backed Soundhound AI (SOUN), gained Monday. The moves helped boost the tech sector, leading the S&P 500 index to a record high. In a note to clients Sunday, Citi analysts said Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market. They said they expect chipmaker’s GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) will double this year. Citi and all but one of the other 22 analysts covering Nvidia tracked by Visible Alpha held a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $152.41, implying about 10% upside from Monday’s closing price. Citi’s comments come after Goldman Sachs analysts said Friday they came away from an investor meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “with a better appreciation of the company’s competitive moat,” citing the company’s large customer base, “robust and growing” software offerings, and ability to innovate. The analysts said orders for Nvidia’s Blackwell chip are booked out with lead times extending up to a year, and that Nvidia “expects supply to remain tight for the foreseeable future.” Goldman Sachs analysts also maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, and raised their price target to $150 from $135 previously. A week ago, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's second largest company by market capitalization, behind only Apple (AAPL). With Monday's gains, Nvidia's market cap is at $3.386 trillion, compared with Apple's $3.516 trillion. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft are the only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion.

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/14/mag-7-become-drag-7-taking-down-qqq--create-opening-for-q-killers/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T17:28:20Z
Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

Title: NVIDIA’s Annualized R&D Expenses Are Now Running At 2X The Rate Of AMD’s

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Research and development (R&D) expenses are one of the highest quality markers of future revenue growth. Given NVIDIA's heightened revenue projections for the upcoming quarters, it is hardly a surprise that it is now absolutely dominating its peers, including AMD, when it comes to the R&D metric. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU — Tech Fund (@techfund1) October 14, 2024 To wit, NVIDIA recorded $3.090 billion in R&D expenses for its July-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $12.36 billion as the GPU manufacturer's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In contrast, AMD recorded $1.593 billion in R&D expenses for its June-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $6.372 billion as the the company's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In other words, NVIDIA is now investing ~2x AMD's R&D expenses, based on the current annualized projections. This marks a significant deviation of pace from back in 2013, when both companies were investing almost identical amounts in their respective R&D activities. Since then, however, NVIDIA has continued to invest a higher amount into its R&D activities, and is now enjoying the fruits of those investments. What's more, AMD has to divide its R&D resources between its CPU, GPU, and FPGA segments. In contrast, NVIDIA is increasingly directing its resources towards building out AI racks, which only furthers the GPU manufacturer's lead in this highly competitive segment. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, William Blair now sees NVIDIA's FY 2025 revenue at a whopping $110 billion. To put this figure into context, the company's FY 2023 revenue was just $15 billion! Bear in mind that NVIDIA's GB200 CPU+GPU combo is currently priced between $60,000 and $70,000, while a single NVIDIA B100 AI accelerator costs between $30,000 and $35,000. What's more, the company's 72-chip AI rack is now priced at between $2 million and $3 million. $NVDA CEO: "We’re not trying to take any share from anybody. NVIDIA is a market maker, not a share taker. If you look at our company slides, not one day does this company talk about market share. All we’re talking about is how do we create the next thing? What’s the next problem… https://t.co/eya7xp7WSm — The Transcript (@TheTranscript_) October 13, 2024 In a recent interview with Altimeter Capital, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang asserted that existing data centers will need around $1 trillion dollar worth of GPUs in the next 4 to 5 years to modernize and remain abreast with the evolving demand environment.

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on track to notch a record high as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company. Shares rose over 3% morning trading Monday to $137.87. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday morning, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

US stocks rose on Monday to head for fresh record highs as Nvidia stock climbed and investors prepared for more big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing." The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.7% to head for a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped around 1% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose toward new highs, up about 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered above the flatline. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 closed a winning week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing.

The company, which faces a record $5 billion in third quarter losses, has slashed 17,000 jobs as a month-long strike hits manufacturing. The the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second-quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third-quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world, in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position, behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.
