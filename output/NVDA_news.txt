Posted on 10/21/2025 8:51:43 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Names across the A.I. space rallied Monday on the back of Nvidia (NVDA) unveiling its first Blackwell wafer produced at TSMC's (TSM) Phoenix plant. Austin Lyons lays out where he sees the state of A.I. heading as demand sees no sign of slowing down. He believes increased competition in AMD Inc. (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) won't steal much of Nvidia's market share but will open the door to new chipmaking processes.

The AI came along created massive and largely unanticipated demand for that market niche. Nvida will have to work hard to keep their market dominance as legacy players like Intel get in the game to develop advanced products for the market. Intel has made a lot of missteps and it has been crippled by it's own success by focusing on selling premium priced derivatives of massive installed base of chips and it has missed the market on emerging advanced chip applications that would have cannibalized sales of it's premium bread and butter chips. . IIn a world where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, Intel has fallen behind the rich getting richer crew but they still have lot of good technology and it would be a mistake to rule them out if they get their act together. Other players like AMD are still in game with products that are less than a generation behind Nvida and they are behind primarily as a conscious business decision based on market position for a lower performance, lower cost, higher volume segment of the market. The rapid explosion in AI in such a short time has caught them by surprise but it's not unreasonable to assume that they can quickly catch up if they choose to focus on the very high performance, AI driven segment of the market. Nvida is a relatively young company that has made it's way with aggressive implementation of a specialized technology. They do not yet have the full range of resources that some of their competition has. This could be a hindrance or an advantage so it is going to be interesting to see how things shake out in the AI world.

Hopefully this will cut nVidia‚Äôs extremely ridiculous prices down within our stratosphere. AMD stock went from about $164 on Oct 3rd to today at $238 AMD deal with OpenAI predict $600 a share maybe in 4 years... üòÅ I‚Äôve had 2 ATI Radeon in the past 20 years, and they both failed within a week. I haven‚Äôt had one since AMD took it over, but if nVidia won‚Äôt drop their prices to a reasonable level, I may have to try again with Radeon. As for motherboards, the last Intel I had was in 1998, when I first got to Japan, since was the only one available at the time. I only build my computers with AMD motherboards and CPUs.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock‚Äôs latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company‚Äôs history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%. We have analyzed the data. Current Financial Overview It's beneficial if the fundamentals align well. For insights on NVDA, read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock. Below are several important figures. But How Does The Stock Perform During Adverse Conditions? Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs past during market downturns reveals that there remains considerable risk despite its advantages. The stock declined close to 85% during the Global Financial Crisis and 68% during the Dot-Com bust. The sell-off in 2018 and the inflation shock each exhibited decreases exceeding 55%, with the latter around 66%. Even the relatively short Covid downturn caused a nearly 38% drop in the stock. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market declines, NVDA is not shielded from significant drops. However, risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions‚Äîconsider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines historically. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices‚Äîthe S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's What Traders Expect Intel Stock To Do After Earnings This Week

Intel (INTC) is set to report third-quarter earnings after markets close Thursday, and traders expect the stock to be unusually volatile following the results. Intel shares are expected to move nearly 10% in either direction the day after this week‚Äôs earnings report, according to recent options prices. A jump of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put shares at about $42, their highest price since April 2024. Alternately, shares could decline 10% to end the week at just above $32. Intel shares have moved an average of 6.5% after its four most recent earnings reports. In July, the stock dropped more than 8% after it reported an unexpected loss and issued a disappointing third-quarter forecast. The last time Intel shares rose on an earnings report was this time last year, when the company touted ‚Äúsolid progress‚Äù on its turnaround plan. Intel's stock has surged in recent months, boosted by optimism about the federal government's stake in the chipmaker and what it means for its troubled foundry business. Expectations for a large post-earnings move likely reflect the stock's recent run-up and uncertainty about how recent investments will affect operations in the near term. Thursday‚Äôs report will be Intel‚Äôs first since the federal government took an approximately 10% stake in the company. That deal with the Trump administration may have been a turning point for the embattled chipmaker, which has since received additional investments from Japanese venture capital firm SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), with whom Intel will partner on custom hardware. During the post-earnings conference call on Thursday, investors will be hoping for updates from executives on those investments and whether they change the outlook for Intel's struggling foundry business The deals have at least been a lifeline for Intel‚Äôs stock, which was treading water until rumors of White House negotiations began to circulate in early August. Intel shares have risen 90% since the start of the year, and all of those gains have come in the last three months. Still, analysts are on the whole skeptical that the stock can maintain its recent momentum. Five of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha have assigned Intel stock a ‚ÄúHold‚Äù rating, while two suggest selling. The average price target of about $30.60 represents nearly 20% downside from Monday's closing level.

Title: S&P 500 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead As Recession Odds Plunge

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500‚Äôs blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan‚Äôs CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of ‚Äúcockroaches‚Äù in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don‚Äôt have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500‚Äôs market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies‚Äô international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.
