Title: The Magnificent 7 trade is struggling — Here's why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Time Published: 2025-02-10T17:26:00Z
Full Content:
Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.79%) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.60%) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT-0.20%). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL-1.10%) and Softbank (SFTBY-1.18%) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.

Title: CoinEx Research January 2025 Report: Trumpian Bitcoin Amid Alts Anxiety

February 10, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research's January 2025 report highlights a volatile month that is shaped by political developments, institutional participation, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 to reach a new all-time high, while altcoins struggled due to liquidity drained by Trump-related tokens. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI model further unsettled global tech and crypto markets, leading to a valuation reset. Institutional Bitcoin adoption continued to gain traction, but a late-month pullback raised concerns about potential market consolidation. A Volatile Start to 2025Bitcoin opened the year at approximately $92,500 and closed near $102,000, demonstrating resilience despite a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a strong labour market and persistent inflation, while the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. The launch of the Official Trump Memecoin and Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI) captured market attention, but their liquidity absorption limited altcoin growth. Given the current conditions, Bitcoin may enter a near-term consolidation phase due to the lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The Trump Effect: Memecoins and DeFi Expansion Donald Trump’s influence in the crypto market grew significantly ahead of his inauguration. His team launched the Official Trump Memecoin on Solana’s Meteora platform, bypassing traditional SOL-based liquidity providers like Raydium. This decision helped push Solana’s stablecoin supply beyond $9 billion, a 130% increase, and drove Solana’s DEX trading volume to an all-time high of $258 billion, three times that of Ethereum. The memecoin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion at its peak, surpassing leading memecoins such as SHIB, PEPE, and WIF. The speculative rally continued with the surprise launch of the Melania Token by First Lady Melania Trump, further intensifying trading activity. However, back-to-back token launches exhausted market liquidity, leading to an eventual pullback. Meanwhile, the Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI), a DeFi project on Ethereum, successfully raised over $300 million in its presale. This signaled that the Trump crypto narrative extended beyond memecoins to include institutional-style DeFi products, blending speculative and financial elements. DeepSeek AI’s Disruptive Impact on Global Markets China’s DeepSeek AI model, launched just before the Lunar New Year, sent shockwaves through global AI and financial markets. With a training cost significantly lower than its Western counterparts—DeepSeek introduced a cost-efficient alternative powered by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This method optimizes computational efficiency by selectively activating only the most relevant sub-networks per query. DeepSeek’s debut triggered a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) plummeting 17% in a single day as investors reassessed the competitive landscape. AI-themed crypto tokens also suffered heavy losses due to broader risk-off sentiment. However, rather than being a structural threat, DeepSeek’s emergence represents a necessary market recalibration that could accelerate AI adoption and unlock new crypto-related opportunities. Source: LiveBench Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Policy Shifts Institutional participation in Bitcoin remained strong in January, supported by major policy developments. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda established a crypto task force, and President Trump signed an executive order in his first week promoting crypto innovation, signaling a shift toward broader adoption. In Illinois, lawmakers advanced a bill to create a state Bitcoin reserve, following Arizona’s move to integrate cryptocurrency into public finance. Outside the U.S., sovereign institutions also increased their Bitcoin exposure. The Czech Central Bank approved Bitcoin for inclusion in its national reserves, while Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund disclosed a 150% year-on-year increase in its Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding $350 million. These moves highlighted a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value among government treasuries and institutional investors. Stablecoin Inflows and Market Caution Stablecoins continued to see strong inflows, with approximately $9.9 billion entering the market in January. This sustained a three-month trend of capital influx, supporting the bullish structure of the market. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs coincided with these inflows, reinforcing the importance of stablecoin liquidity in market momentum. However, despite the positive trend, a notable market pullback in late January suggests a cautious outlook. If stablecoin inflows slow or turn into net outflows, the market could face a period of consolidation, leading to increased volatility. Investors should closely monitor stablecoin trends as an indicator of broader market sentiment. Market Outlook for February 2025 Looking ahead, the market’s direction in February will be shaped by institutional developments, regulatory policies, and stablecoin movements. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss. Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday. “The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”. According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries. France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI. “The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 7, Timothy Arcuri from UBS maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $185.00. Besides UBS, analyst Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the stock and calls Nvidia a “top pick”. On February 6th, Moore reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $152 price target. He said investors should buy in the DeepSeek dip. “While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build [and] customer desire to spend is clearly on display. We remain very optimistic on how the balance of the year plays out.” Amongst other things, Moore believes the biggest long-term catalyst for Nvidia goes beyond AI training and into the company’s leadership in the inference market. Inference is a process where trained AI models apply its knowledge to new data and then making predictions or decisions based on that data. “We remain convinced that Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of long inference workloads.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeepSeek's efficiency means Big Tech must stop hoarding, creating more winners. Here are the 12 stocks expected to benefit.

The good, bad, and the ugly are merging as AI enters the next stage of development: competition and efficiency. We all knew this day would come, but perhaps not as soon as it did. DeepSeek's more efficient and cheaper model means Big Tech suddenly has a chink in its armor. Investors question whether they have overvalued the blue chips and their pricing power, especially concerning their proprietary language models. It will be a volatile ride until Wall Street figures that out. For now, AI-related stocks have been dumping almost indiscriminately or at the slightest hint of a slowdown. Chip designer ARM was a recent victim of that trend. It announced earnings Wednesday with some of the best numbers you can get on a typical stock, said Sandeep Rao, a quantitative analyst at Leverage Shares ETPs. Still, the stock closed down by over 7%. "It's clearly evident that this stock is supposed to be soaring," Rao said. "The company's IP is used in virtually every major smartphone in the world. Its software is also used by Apple computers. It has a tie-up with Nvidia, and its backup is SoftBank, which is part of the Stargate project pumping $500 billion into AI cloud infrastructure." ARM CEO Rene Haas also welcomed DeepSeek during its February 5 earnings call, referring to it as "creative" and a welcomed efficiency that would only increase demand for computing. He added that his company was well-positioned to take advantage of efficiencies, including for smaller devices that don't require high-powered Nvidia chips. ARM isn't alone. As AI stocks report earnings, they find themselves in a similar predicament: explaining to Wall Street's money movers that they are well-positioned to continue riding out the AI hype. DeepSeek isn't exactly open source; in other words, it doesn't share its full code. It's open weight, which means it shows its memory or knowledge process. This allows users to adjust it for specific tasks, lowering the bar for startups and companies to enter the space and create specialized business models that could lead to affordability, increased demand, and explosive growth. Before DeepSeek, proprietary models required huge computing power, which meant expensive and small supercomputers were the perceived solution for efficiency. DeepSeek changed that thesis, suggesting that optimization isn't a hardware problem but one that can be addressed with code, Rao said. It also proved that the open-source community was far more efficient at driving results, validating the argument that AI and machine learning should not be done behind closed doors, Rao added. It's a technology that can best be done as a tide that lifts all boats instead of one that's hoarded by a few. But in terms of winners and losers, investors should be concerned with the picks and shovels: companies tasked with building AI infrastructure, said Abby Yoder, a US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. The focus must now turn to their revenue and gross margin line items to determine whether they will see the impact. She added that CapEx spending isn't dropping; it's actually increasing, but it could be shifting elsewhere. "So, are they going to be going to the incumbent winners that we've seen over the past couple of years who have had this outsized pricing power leading to those really high margins?" Yoder said. Or are they going to semiconductor companies making specialized chips, hardware providers, or software companies? It's the key query investors will need to be able to answer if they want to continue winning in this space. On JPMorgan's part, the investment bank's North America equity research team created a list of stocks they're overweight on and that they expect will be positively impacted by competitive and efficient AI. Software Companies that can use efficiency to increase their total addressable markets will be the new big winners. Here, Yoder believes it will be the software companies. Cloud-based data storage provider Snowflake (SNOW) is positioned to benefit from increased demand as more AI applications develop, increasing the requirement for data storage services. Cloud-based software provider Salesforce (CRM) could be at the forefront of benefiting from cheaper and therefore increased software use. Semiconductors In the semiconductor space, Yoder says an investor should focus on those gaining versus those losing market share. Overall, the demand for AI chips is expected to increase, not drop, though that may not be the case for every chipmaker, read JPMorgan's note. Within this sector, companies that provide application-specific integrated circuits" (ASICs), which are microchips made for certain functions instead of general use, are well-positioned to gain from the increased use of more accessible AI models. ASIC suppliers set to benefit include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL). Micron (MU) is expected to benefit as a memory and storage chip provider as AI adoption accelerates. Despite fears about how necessary Nvidia's (NVDA) expensive and advanced chips will be, increased demand for AI models will also mean increased demand for GPUs. Internet and hyperscalers The big, leading names like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta sit in this category. Not only are they developers of AI models, but they are also the spenders that largely determine where money for infrastructure and software will go. Here, efficiency will create a cheaper and broader ecosystem for AI on the internet, and the sharing of developments will push the big players to also become efficient, read JPMorgan's note, which projects 2025 capex spending for Amazon at $97 billion, Meta at $65 billion, and Google at $62 billion. Since Meta's Llama model is also open weight, it's expected to be a main beneficiary of language models like DeepSeek, where its efficiency can be integrated into Meta's ecosystem. "At 4Q earnings, META reiterated the benefits of open source LLMs, noted that costs can be driven down, & — in light of DeepSeek — emphasized the importance of having an American standard for open source that extends globally," JP Morgan's note read. Amazon is also not shying away from more efficacious models. Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. The global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump’s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market’s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump’s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead. Fidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector’s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired “soft landing,” says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates. The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.

As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals. Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Average Upside Potential: 36.0% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley gave an “Overweight” rating on the company’s stock, providing a price target of $152. The analyst noted that China’s DeepSeek, an AI model matching its American rivals in performance and at a much cheaper cost, established some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) around export controls and longer-term investment. Despite these challenges, Moore opines that near-term checks remain strong for its Hopper platform. The analyst believes that Blackwell’s supply visibility has been building and that customers’ desire to spend remains clearly visible. Elsewhere, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial upped the company’s stock to “Strong Buy,” raising its price objective to $220. Even though DeepSeek's R1 AI model has been claiming competitive features at lower costs, Tigress Financial noted unknown capabilities and security concerns. The firm lauded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s critical role in AI and data center growth and sees it as a long-term beneficiary of continued investments. Furthermore, lawmakers in the US have plans to ban DeepSeek. The AI infrastructure build-out continues to act as a major tailwind for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, cloud service providers, sovereign states, and consumer internet companies have been fueling demand for AI computing power. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.” Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fears Over Tariffs And AI Spending Overwhelm Better Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/02/08/fears-over-tariffs-and-ai-spending-overwhelm-better-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-02-08T15:52:41Z
Full Content:
Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: The 'Magnificent Seven' era is ending, says the Bank of America strategist who named it

The man who coined the term “Magnificent Seven,” which refers to seven high-performing tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOGL-0.73%), Amazon (AMZN-0.45%), Apple (AAPL+2.31%), Nvidia (NVDA-0.79%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.20%), Meta (META+0.42%), and Tesla (TSLA-7.16%) — now believes its golden era is about to end, and that’s due to the AI battle driven by DeepSeek. Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America (BAC+0.43%) Global Research, warned in his latest note that the U.S. stock market’s global dominance will peak in 2025 and is nearing its end. Read here: Which stocks are in the Magnificent 7? The arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup that has developed AI models comparable to those of OpenAI but apparently at a fraction of the cost and energy, has caused turmoil in the stock market, leading to a significant sell-off in the tech sector. In his note, Hartnett indicated that spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach its peak soon. “US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned,” the strategist wrote. “‘Magnificent 7’ becomes ‘Lagnificent 7,’ supports broadening of US and global equity and credit markets.” Beyond AI, Hartnett sees other key drivers of U.S. market outperformance—such as excess fiscal support and immigration—waning this year. He doubts U.S. stocks will continue to outpace global markets, citing an expected slowdown in government spending and tighter immigration policies. Fiscal spending has been high in recent years, but President Trump is now pushing for extensive cuts, even creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hartnett has advised investors to seek cheaper international markets instead of pursuing overpriced U.S. stocks. He noted that equities from Brazil, Germany, the UK, and Canada have provided higher returns than Wall Street’s S&P 500-listed stocks.

Title: Stock Markets Analysis: A Weak-Handed Exit

The saga showed how quickly markets can react and readjust. Some of the biggest stocks out there – global, household names – dove hard. Things got ugly for a bit. But for long-term, data-based investors, DeepSeek’s shake out was a gift because it revealed the “weak hands.” By “weak hands,” I mean investors who lack conviction in their trades. Basically, they see an opportunity on Wednesday but then see a disaster on Thursday and sell off. In this latest iteration, these traders probably bought into AI late last year, then were spooked early this year when things got chaotic. These “last in, first out” traders just pulled off a weak-handed exit. But here’s the thing – Big Money kept buying throughout the carnage. That data provided bullish conviction. When the Big Money Index (BMI) is heading higher, my bullish stance is grounded and backed by years of money flows. And the BMI is rapidly gaining, proving that money is being put to work: As the chart shows, in two weeks, the BMI rose from 37% to 51%. That reflects Big Money accumulation. So Big Money bought, but some stocks were slaughtered? Yes. Technology stock liquidations were strong after the DeepSeek announcement. Many of the hottest names and industry groups were beaten to a pulp. For instance, using the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) as a proxy, we can see semis had one of their steepest daily declines in years, crashing 9.8% on Jan. 27. Using another popular ticker as a proxy, the bellwether semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) slid 17% that same day. On the surface, it felt like doom was not just near, but here. However, acting on emotions is rarely profitable. It’s better to use cold, hard data as a guide. And when possible, dive deep – index-level analysis is the tip of the iceberg. As the weak hands panicked, MAPsignals data noted healthy accumulation. From Jan. 27-29, there were 225 Big Money buy signals versus 112 sell signals. That’s twice as many buys as sells, all during “doom.” Money rarely exits markets, it simply rotates. You can see Big Money was buying across the board: The sectors that attracted heavy capital inflows were technology, health care, and discretionary: The MAPsignals stance that Big Money buyers are after high-quality names, particularly in the technology sector, is strengthened by the DeepSeek situation. Of course, sitting through the wreckage wasn’t fun. But that’s part of being an investor. Under the surface, it’s clear Big Money is chasing high-quality stocks in a handful of sectors. You can’t tell that from the gloomy DeepSeek-related headlines, but you can with a MAP. Even though some assets dipped, the BMI is lifting. It’s the weak hands waving goodbye!

Title: Big Tech is a pawn in US-China trade war. Here's why some will feel the heat more than others.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President Trump’s trade war with China kicked off on Tuesday, with the White House implementing a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods coming into the US. Silicon Valley’s biggest companies are already getting caught up in what could turn into a series of tit-for-tat actions between the world’s two largest economies. On Tuesday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that it is opening an antitrust investigation into Google (GOOG, GOOGL). The agency didn’t provide any additional details about the move. Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that China is considering launching an antitrust investigation into Apple’s (AAPL) App Store practices. SAMR officials have been speaking with Apple executives for some time already, but the timing of the potential probe sets up Apple as another pawn in the economic chess match between the superpowers. And according to the Financial Times, Chinese officials are considering launching a probe into Intel (INTC) on top of an ongoing investigation into Nvidia (NVDA). It’s all a part of China’s effort to punish the US’s most prominent companies and inflict its own pain on the US, as the two nations continue to battle it out in the weeks and months ahead. Here’s a rundown of which companies will feel the heat, and which should remain relatively unscathed. For now. Apple is taking hits from both the US and China in the countries’ latest economic skirmish. The US kicked things off by levying its tariff on goods made in China, which includes Apple products and its all-important iPhone. That would drive prices on Apple’s hardware higher, potentially by as much as 10%, or force Apple to eat some or all of the tariff cost, lowering iPhone margins. Apple can also file for an exemption to the tariffs, which it did during the prior Trump administration. That would allow it to bring its devices into the US without having to deal with the 10% levy. But so far, there's no word on whether it's able to do so. China is now retaliating via its antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store practices. The investigation itself isn’t unique. The European Union and other nations have forced Apple to make changes to its App Store requirements and payment system in recent years. And the Justice Department has filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging it purposely makes it difficult for consumers to use third-party hardware or switch to another band of devices. But tariffs and China’s antitrust action are unlikely to significantly damage Apple finances. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? According to BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan, Apple could move device assembly to factories in other countries, something the company has been doing since COVID exposed weakness in its supply chain. If Apple builds 80% of its devices outside of China, it would only see a $0.05 earnings per share impact this fiscal year. If 50% are sourced from outside of China that could rise to between $0.07 and $0.12 per share. China’s antitrust crackdown would similarly put a dent in Apple’s earnings, but it wouldn’t be a wipeout, Wedbush’s Dan Ives explained in an investor note. The company pulled in $26 billion in Services revenue, which includes App Store sales, in Q1 and $124 billion in overall sales for the quarter. According to Ives, Apple generates $5 billion a year via its Chinese App Store, which is a relatively thin slice of the company’s overall pie. “It’s less about revenue exposure for investors and more about building US/China tensions with US Big Tech in line for retaliatory shots across the bow,” Ives wrote in his memo. Intel, Google, and Nvidia are also facing potential antitrust investigations as part of China’s response to US tariffs, and it could mean trouble for Intel in particular. The chipmaker generates the bulk of its revenue through sales in China. In 2024, China accounted for $15.5 billion of the company’s $53.1 billion in revenue. The US, Intel’s second-largest region, made up $12.9 billion. Intel is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, putting the company in a particularly precarious situation if China decides to take some kind of action against the company. Google, for its part, does very little business in China. After pulling its operations from the company years ago, the only real presence the company has is selling ads for Chinese businesses looking to reach foreign customers. “It’s almost comical that China is considering regulating Google — since Google is effectively banned there,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a research note. Things are a bit shakier for Nvidia. The company is under pressure from both China and the US after China launched a probe into the company in December following then-President Biden's move to restrict exports of certain Nvidia chips to the country. And after the debut of DeepSeek's AI models, which the company developed using underpowered Nvidia chips, the US is considering tightening those export restrictions even further. China accounted for $5.4 billion of Nvidia’s $35 billion in revenue in Q3, well behind the US’s $14.8 billion in sales. But as one of the AI industry’s largest markets, China is an important piece of the company’s overall strategy. It’s not entirely clear what an antitrust probe would mean for Nvidia in China, but if the US forces the company to restrict more chips than it already does, it could face a revenue headwind out of the region. For now, Big Tech has to contend with the US’s tariffs. But with China signaling it’s willing to put a hurting on Silicon Valley companies if Trump pushes things further, firms won’t be able to rest comfortably for some time.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. PwC highlights that the automotive semiconductor market reached $76 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $117 billion by 2028, driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Power semiconductors, particularly those utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are expected to reach $6 billion, comprising 18% of the market by 2028. Meanwhile, automotive system-on-chip (SoC) revenue was $7 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR through 2028, supporting real-time data processing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, prompting major economies to pursue self-sufficiency. By 2027, approximately $400 billion in government funding is expected to be allocated to semiconductor initiatives. The US has already awarded $29.5 billion in grants and $25.1 billion in loans, with total investments projected to reach $348 billion by 2030. The European Union has allocated $46 billion for incentives, while China has invested over $190 billion through its National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund and local initiatives. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have also introduced tax incentives and subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor production. The demand for custom ICs tailored to specific applications is surging, especially in data centers, video processing, and network security. By 2028, the market for data center custom ICs is expected to reach $24 billion. AI is a critical growth driver for the semiconductor industry, requiring GPUs, accelerators, and HBM. The AI-specific silicon market is forecasted to reach $150 billion by 2028. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. For this article, we selected companies that operate in the semiconductor sector that are in focus as investors exit tech stocks amid fears of an AI bubble. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a visual computing firm. JP Morgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Nvidia, noting that past innovation cycles suggest that efficiency and technology improvements drive further adoption and innovation. Analysts led by Harlan Sur said that after the launch of the DeepSeek R1 large language model last week, investors were concerned regarding the intermediate and long-term effects for AI semiconductor spending given the Chinese startup's claim regarding their compute efficiency in terms of cost and performance for training/inferencing AI models. However, the analysts noted that despite the impressive cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s training and inference, several questions remain unanswered, including the complete training costs for R1 and the extent of reliance on larger open-source foundation models developed earlier. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the chip stocks in focus amid tech selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Amazon (AMZN-0.45%) is the latest technology giant to announce it will continue spending massive amounts of cash on artificial intelligence, even after Chinese startup DeepSeek’s success. CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call on Thursday that the company’s $26.3 billion in capital expenditures last quarter is “reasonably representative” of what has been budgeted for 2025. If continued, that would put Amazon on track to spend more than $100 billion this year, which most of the cash supporting AI services and tech infrastructure. “The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for [Amazon Web Services],” Jassy said on the call, calling that spending a “good sign” for AWS. “[W]e think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it and with inference being a core building block, just like compute and storage and database.” Amazon has introduced a number of new AI-based products and invested heavily in Anthropic, a startup founded by ex-OpenAI staffers. The Seattle-based company in December even unveiled its own AI training chips, the Trainium3, which are expected to be available in late 2025. It’s not the only tech leader planning to spend billions on AI this year, as demand remains intense. Microsoft (MSFT-0.20%) in early January said it plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers in its fiscal year 2025, which ends on June 30. The data centers will be used for training and deploying AI models and cloud-based applications. More than half of the investment will be focused in the U.S., Microsoft President Brad Smith said at the time. “As we look into the future, it’s clear that artificial intelligence is poised to become a world-changing GPT [General-Purpose Technology],” Smith said in a statement. “AI promises to drive innovation and boost productivity in every sector of the economy. Later in January, Meta Platforms (META+0.42%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post that the Facebook and Instagram-owned will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI this year. He wrote that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Google-parent (GOOGL-0.73%) Alphabet said it would spend $75 billion on AI this year, 29% greater than Wall Street had expected. “The cost of actually using [AI] is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on an earnings call, adding that Google is investing to “meet the moment.” OpenAI last month announced Stargate, a planned $500 billion AI infrastructure project backed by SoftBank (SFTBY-1.18%) and Oracle (ORCL-1.10%), among others. That cash would be doled out over the next four years. Silicon Valley’s major spending on AI was called into question after DeepSeek claimed it had spent cost just $5.6 million to train and develop an AI model that rivaled models made by OpenAI and Meta. Tech stocks entered a freefall after Wall Street caught wind, giving chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-0.79%) the biggest one-day drop in market value in history. However, some tech leaders are calling into question whether what DeepSeek achieved was actually done on such a low budget. Meta has reportedly set up “war rooms” to investigate the models, while Microsoft is probing whether DeepSeek had access to OpenAI’s tech.
