Title: Quantum computing will be useful in the next 4 years: IBM chief

Quantum computing has the potential to greatly accelerate breakthroughs in everything from pharmaceuticals to predicting stock market behavior — and these advances could be right around the corner, according to IBM (IBM+0.42%) CEO Arvind Krishna. Artificial intelligence is all the rage in the tech industry, but the current generation of AI won’t get the industry to an all knowing artificial general intelligence model, Krishna said on Tuesday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Breakthroughs are instead expected to come from AI working in complement with quantum computing. “AI is learning from already produced knowledge, literature, graphics and so on, it is not trying to figure out what is going to come,” Krishna said. Quantum computers instead work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. Quantum computing technology, when achieved in full, has the potential to be much faster than regular computers and could go beyond what AI systems can provide to give insights into “how nature behaves,” the IBM chief said, particularly on a sub-atomic level. “Once we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that is in existing knowledge,” Krishna said. The industry’s belief in how fast quantum computing technology can scale up has wavered recently. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg claimed that useful quantum computers are 15-30 years away, which tanked quantum computing stocks like IonQ (IONQ+17.35%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI+10.19%). Although the technology has more progress it needs to count, Krishna believes that quantum computing is “going to surprise you before this decade is up.” He isn’t the only person to believe this either. Microsoft (MSFT+0.61%) co-founder Bill Gates told Yahoo Finance last month that quantum computing could become useful in as soon as 3 to 5 years. And there have been recent advancements in quantum computing, most notably in December when Google (GOOGL+1.93%) unveiled its latest quantum chip Willow. Google claims the chip will greatly reduce error rates, one of the greatest challenges plaguing quantum technology. On the other hand, the biggest problems facing AI, according to Krishna, are a lack of domain specificity — in depth knowledge of particular fields or application areas — as well as the technology’s notorious energy intensity. “I’ll predict for you that five years from now, most of the models are going to be using 1% of the energy of what they’re using today,” Krishna said. “I think DeepSeek gave us a preview.” Quantum computing, while still costly, has the potential to be less energy intensive than AI data centers. Krishna also said that IBM is working on building practical use cases for the technology, not just investing in making the quantum computing hardware. “In the end, to me, value in technology is not derived from the invention. Much as we love the invention, value is derived from people using it,” Krishna said. “Sometimes, when we get ahead of ourselves, we get too focused on the invention and not on making sure that there are hundreds and thousands of different companies, private and public, that are using it. So that’s what we’re trying to get done in this case and I think we’re kind of going at the right pace in this instance,” he added. Industry leaders will be getting together on March 20th for Nvidia’s (NVDA+6.18%) first “Quantum Day,” at the tech giant’s GPU Technology Conference to discuss where quantum computing is headed.

Title: DeepSeek's founder isn't interested in investors for now

Time Published: 2025-03-11T15:14:00Z

Artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rattled the industry earlier this year — but its founder is reportedly not interested in bringing in outside capital just yet. DeepSeek’s founder Liang Wenfeng isn’t rushing to find investors who would interfere with his control and the company’s decisions, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.32%) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Liang reportedly also is wary of stakeholders involved with the government due to fears that it could hamper DeepSeek’s global efforts. Since its AI models sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and Wall Street in January, DeepSeek has received interest from China’s tech giants, including Tencent (TCEHY-1.22%) and Alibaba (BABA-1.38%), over potential collaborations, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company has also reportedly been offered a low-interest loan from the state-owned Bank of China (BACHY-0.56%). After DeepSeek released results in January demonstrating that its open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, can perform comparably to those from OpenAI on several industry benchmarks, it sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks. In December, the company released its DeepSeek-V3 models, which it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA+6.18%) H800 chips — a reduced-capability version of the more powerful chips that U.S. firms have touted spending tens of billions of dollars on. Amid the hype over R1, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-2.35%) App Store downloads. The DeepSeek site experienced outages due to the influx of new users, and the company had to issue a temporary limit on registrations after “large-scale malicious attacks.” Since then, DeepSeek has continued to experience service outages from an overabundance of users, and has come under scrutiny by the U.S. and other countries over data security risks. Last month, DeepSeek published its techniques for training its AI models with the H800 chips, and is planning an April release for its next reasoning model, the Wall Street Journal reported. DeepSeek’s AI models are currently mostly available for free. Before its success, DeepSeek had sought venture capital funding, but was turned down, the Wall Street Journal reported. Now, the company is reportedly looking to work with larger tech firms to develop commercial AI applications. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks ended lower on Tuesday, extending Monday’s rout, as President Donald Trump doubled down on his trade war with Canada and a warning from Delta Air Lines sent many travel-related stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 478 points, or 1.1%, and the S&P 500 slid 0.8%. The Nasdaq closed down about 0.2% as a 1.7% rebound in Nvidia (NVDA+6.18%) and gains in some other Big Tech stocks weren’t enough to save the day. Shares of Apple (AAPL-2.35%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.93%) both declined. Trump escalated his dispute with Canada by saying he would double tariffs on the country’s aluminum and steel to 50% after Ontario enacted a levy on electricity it sends to the U.S. The administration remains confident of the long-term benefit of its economic changes, a spokeswoman said. “We are in a period of economic transition from that economic nightmare under a president who had no idea what he was doing, never held a private sector job in his life, into a golden age of American manufacturing,” Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House. One bit of good economic news came through on Tuesday: U.S. job openings rose to 7.74 million in January from a revised 7.51 million in December, a sign that the labor market was holding steady as President Joe Biden left office. The consensus estimate had been for 7.6 million openings. Tesla (TSLA+7.34%) stock staged a modest comeback from yesterday’s 15% plummet, rising 3.8%, as Trump said he’d buy one of Elon Musk’s EVs. Delta Air Lines (DAL-2.98%) stock fell 7.3% after the company cut its first-quarter profit and sales forecasts on weaker domestic travel demand. It retained its full-year outlook. American Airlines (AAL-4.14%), Expedia (EXPE-0.30%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.99%), Hilton (HLT-1.55%) and Airbnb (ABNB+0.67%) shares also declined. Disney (DIS+0.97%) fell 5%, extending its recent decline. Retailers also got pummeled. Kohl’s (KSS-4.86%) plunged 24% after its quarterly earnings missed consensus and its projections also fell short. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS-1.99%) fell 5.7% after a disappointing earnings outlook outweighed better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Southwest Airlines (LUV-1.09%) stock, by contrast, jumped 8.3% after the carrier said it will abandon its free-bags policy for most passengers, which analysts said will boost revenue but will also damage its brand and erode customer loyalty. Oracle (ORCL+4.49%) dropped 3.1% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/03/11/this-simple-investing-blunder-could-cost-you-8-dividends/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T12:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields. CEFs Outperform Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further. STK Total Returns Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain. CEF Premiums Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out. Swappable CEFs See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Notable reports expected this week include: These data points will be closely monitored, as they could influence the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates and shape investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve has been working to tame inflation after it peaked above 9% in 2022. Despite some progress, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. If Wednesday’s CPI data shows continued inflationary pressure, the Fed may consider maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period. A cooling labor market and slowing economic growth add complexity to the Fed’s decision-making. Policymakers must balance curbing inflation without triggering a deep recession. With Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, spending cuts, and stricter immigration policies—shaping future economic conditions, the Fed’s next steps will be closely scrutinized.

Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a “period” of transition from the policy changes he’s making. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA+6.18%) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA+7.34%) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will “burn” Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR+7.54%) stock also declined. Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure. Here are some stocks to watch today: Airbnb (ABNB+0.67%) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company’s durable growth and its addition of an “experiences” category. Bally’s (BALY-3.90%) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company’s shares. Cognizant (CTSH-3.01%) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm. Coinbase (COIN-0.44%) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported. Crowdstrike (CRWD+5.05%) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company’s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week. All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets. Doordash (DASH+1.77%) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company’s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices. IBM (IBM+0.42%) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR’s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn’t comment on the decision. Microchip Technology (MCHP-0.63%) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that’s been exacerbated by the chipmaker’s falling revenue and weak margins. Oracle (ORCL+4.49%) will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Monday. The software giant’s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth. Consensus estimates call for profit of $1.49 per share and revenue of $14.38 billion. The stock fell 4.6% in morning trading ahead of the report. Harri Weber contributed to this report.

Title: The Dow tanks as Trump won't rule out a recession. Nvidia and Tesla stock take a hit

Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street’s fears tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,” Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, “are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.” The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA+7.34%) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA+6.18%) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears. The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged. Goldman Sachs (GS+1.05%) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase. On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA-0.83%) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn’t rule it out as a potential outcome. “I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market’s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has “just become hooked” on government spending and that “there’s going to be a detox period.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn’t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn’t affect federal policy. —Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

[+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

[+] The Magnificent 7 has retreated by almost 16% since mid-December. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Performance The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time. The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case. Estimated First Quarter U.S. Economic Growth Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth. The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%. Monthly Job Growth The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again. The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn. Initial Jobless Claims The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession. Consumer Sentiment Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of former President Joe Biden’s term. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies. Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating. The February consumer inflation release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome. Consumer Inflation Estimate Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt. While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio. S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. Warren Buffett’s recent annual letter did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

The latest reports on inflation, jobs, and consumer sentiment could be in the spotlight this week, with Wednesday's release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) offering a key update on price pressures in February. Investors will also be watching for scheduled earnings reports from tech giants Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). Results from several retailers, including Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), and Dollar General (DG), could offer a look at retail sales amid worries about tariffs and consumer confidence. Monday, March 10 Tuesday, March 11 Wednesday, March 12 Thursday, March 13 Friday, March 14 Fresh inflation figures due this week are expected to offer a look at how prices performed in February, the first full month of data under the administration of President Donald Trump since his reelection. The CPI release on Wednesday follows other recent inflation reports showing price pressures easing somewhat, though the January CPI reading ticked higher. The data could be key for Federal Reserve officials, who have said they are closely watching pricing data as they evaluate interest rate levels. Other inflation-related indicators scheduled for this week include wholesale pricing data Thursday with the Producer Price Index. The scheduled Friday release of March consumer sentiment data tracks consumer expectations of inflation, an indicator also followed by Fed officials. The University of Michigan's sentiment survey comes after recent reports have shown U.S. consumers are beginning to lose confidence in the economy amid tariff uncertainty and job loss fears. The NFIB small business sentiment survey scheduled for release Tuesday could also provide insights on how small businesses are evaluating economic conditions. Tech giant Oracle is set to kick off the week's earnings on Monday, with analysts expecting rising revenue and profit after disappointing sales in the prior quarter. Oracle’s report comes as the cloud software provider joined a $500 billion joint venture with OpenAI and other tech firms to help build out AI infrastructure. Creative software leader Adobe is expected to follow Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching for signs its AI efforts are paying off, after reporting lower-than-expected revenue in the prior quarter and offering an underwhelming sales outlook. Retailers will also be in focus with several chains scheduled to report this week, including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s, Ulta Beauty, Casey's General Stores, and Dollar General. The results come as market participants watch for the impact of shifting trade policies and waning consumer confidence. CoreWeave, a cloud computing company backed by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), could also go public as soon as this week, in what is expected to be one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years.
