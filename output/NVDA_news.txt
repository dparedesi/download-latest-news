Tech giants that have dominated Wall Street for two years are losing their grip, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks shedding about $1.4 trillion in market value since December, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven index—tracking Apple Inc AAPL, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Microsoft Corp MSFT, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL)) GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META and Tesla Inc TSLA—has fallen roughly 10% from its December peak, officially entering correction territory. Don't Miss: Tesla has been the hardest hit, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet. Elon Musk‘s electric vehicle maker initially surged after President Donald Trump‘s November election victory but has since faced declining sales and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Meta stands as the lone bright spot, bucking the downward trend as investors endorse its AI strategy. The Facebook parent recorded a 19-day winning streak in February, adding more than $320 billion in market value. “The stock market has lost its leadership,” Jim Paulsen, an independent market strategist, told the Financial Times. Trending: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum It's a pivot from 2023 and 2024, when the seven companies posted enormous gains and drove the broader market higher. The Magnificent Seven had surged more than 160% between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, according to the FT, but the index has added just 1% so far this year. Investors are rotating into other sectors, with U.S. bank stocks attracting almost $2 billion in the week ended Feb. 3—the second-largest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Bank of America data cited by FT. Healthcare companies, European equities, gold, and smaller tech groups have also benefited from this repositioning. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Meanwhile, money is increasingly flowing toward privately held tech companies, with Anthropic, Coreweave, Databricks, OpenAI, Perplexity, ScaleAI and xAI—now dubbed the “Private Magnificent Seven,” seeing their cumulative valuation rise 40% between July and January, according to FT. Most market watchers view the broadening gains as healthy for what had become an expensive, top-heavy market. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Mislav Matejka caution that faster AI adoption and fewer barriers to entry could spell long-term trouble for the established tech giants. “Historically, it was never the incumbents which benefited from technological disruption, but the outsiders,” Matejka told FT.

Title: Markets wrap rough month driven by ‘Extreme Fear’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks seesawed Friday, but all three major indexes closed the month in the red — a sign of increasing unease in markets. Volatility gripped markets as traders closed out a dismal February that wiped out some gains. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday and for the fourth day in a row, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Stocks initially rose Friday morning, buoyed by cooling inflation data that provided relief for investors. Yet markets moved into the red midday following a very public heated exchange at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that stoked uncertainty around geopolitical stability. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, popped to its highest level this year. In afternoon trading, markets recouped losses, and the major indexes surged higher to close out the day. The Dow ended the day up 601 points, or 1.39%, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.63%. Yet US markets sputtered in February and slid this week. The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1% this week and is down 1.4% this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.5% this week and 4% this month, its worth month since April 2024. “We believe there is valid concern in the markets about the amount of money being spent on Artificial Intelligence datacenters and capex, considering news from China AI startup DeepSeek in late January,” said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a Friday note. Tentarelli said uncertainty about AI spending coupled with concerns about economic growth has led many of the stocks leading the Nasdaq to underperform. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward tech and was driven higher last year by companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Palantir (PLTR). Yet those surging tech stocks have slowed down this month. Tesla shares are down about 26% over the past month. The reasons for the Nasdaq’s decline range from inflation risk to decelerating growth to its stocks having tough outlooks compared to other assets, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, in an email. “Concerns about potential economic growth deceleration may be fostering increased risk aversion, potentially leading investors to shift away from the more volatile Nasdaq index in favor of more stable investment options,” said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. Nvidia posted strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, though its stock’s high valuation raises the question of how much more room there is to run. Still, the broader market remains near its all-time high, reached just last week. And the bumpiness in the market isn’t all that unusual for this time of year. “The stock market’s recent declines are simply garden variety volatility, largely because February is historically a volatile month, and because we saw significant gains throughout January,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. While new inflation data matched expectations, other economic data released Friday revealed cracks in the economy that contributed to weary investor sentiment: Consumer spending pulled back far more than economists expected in January and posted the biggest monthly decline since February 2021. “Investors will continue to focus on the uncertain growth trajectory as real spending unexpectedly fell in January from weaker consumer demand,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank’s estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 were also revised on Friday to project a decline of 1.5%, rather than growth of 2.3%. “This huge drop in the estimate reflects the very weak data that has been coming out on retail sales, net imports, inventories and new home sales,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said he is cautious about the market due to high valuations. At UBS, strategists advised preparing for volatility ahead, though considered the bull market intact. “We think the bull market is intact driven by healthy economic and profit growth, supportive Fed policy and AI spending/adoption,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Friday note. “But we have also cautioned that volatility would likely be higher this year due to policy uncertainty and trade frictions. Therefore, we have been highlighting that short-term hedges may be worth considering,” said Lefkowitz. CNN’s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Stocks were higher on Friday as President Trump’s latest announcement of new tariffs and China’s vow to retaliate heightened trade tensions. At around 12:40 PM in New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average popped by 0.2%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge tracking consumer spending on goods and services, was released in the morning, showing a 2.6% annual inflation rate for January—matching estimates and signaling steady inflation. Here are stocks to watch today: Dell (DELL-5.38%) shares declined on Friday after the tech company posted better-than-expected earnings but reported revenue of $23.9 billion, falling short of the projected $24.55 billion. Investors are also concerned about the profitability of the firm’s server business. Monster Beverage (MNST+5.47%) stock gained on Friday after the drink company’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ expectations, even as earnings per share fell short, Reuters reported. NetApp’s (NTAP-16.69%) shares fell in the afternoon as the company’s revenue missed consensus. AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) recovered in the morning following President Trump’s tariff plans and China’s vows to take retaliatory measures. Earlier this week, the chip giant surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, highlighting sustained demand fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Rocket Lab (RKLB+0.23%) stock plunged on Friday after the commercial space company posted fourth-quarter results that were in line with expectations but issued disappointing guidance and announced product delays. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) shares fell, wiping out gains from earlier this week as the escalating tariff war and economic concerns weighed on the AI hardware maker.

Title: Nvidia and Big Tech stocks can't escape the market's growing anxiety

Tech stocks aren’t feeling the love from investors this earnings cycle, with even Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) set for a weekly decline despite releasing an upbeat forecast and last-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Dell’s (DELL-5.38%) stock fell on Friday after its profit topped forecasts, but investors chose to focus on a revenue miss and the narrow profitability of its server business. Autodesk (ADSK-4.57%) slumped after rising yesterday on an earnings beat and newly disclosed plans to lay off employees. HP Inc. (HPQ-8.18%) and NetApp (NTAP-16.69%) also slid after earnings. Palantir (PLTR-1.26%) and Super Micro (SMCI-4.70%) extended declines. “While fourth-quarter earnings have been generally positive, with more companies than average beating expectations, some of the commentary about 2025 has been more negative,” Michael Rosen, CIO of Angeles Investments, told Quartz. Weaker consumer spending, tariffs, and possible policy changes are creating uncertainty. Nvidia did give a positive outlook, but investors in Big Tech stocks are still getting more cautious amid the general anxiety, Rosen added. They’ve had an incredible run over the past two years — justified by rising profits — but they’re now broadening their focus, as shown by gains in European equities. Mike Treacy, Head of Market Risk at Apex Fintech Solutions, sees a more-technical explanation for the weakness in tech stocks. “We are seeing a massive unwind across multiple risk assets: AI, momentum stocks, crypto, etc.,” he told Quartz. “We are below the 200-day moving average in both SMH and NVDA. Despite robust earnings from NVDA, we could see technical selling across the AI ecosystem until these charts recover.” The days a single earnings report could cause a jump in Nvidia’s stock are probably over because the company has become so big in market value, said Explosive Options’ founder Bob Lang. “There was nothing wrong with the earnings,” Lang said in an interview. “It’s just become a megacap company, like Microsoft (MSFT0.00%) before that and IBM (IBM-0.94%) even earlier. It’s unlikely to be better than a market performer, not a stock that fund managers can rely on to make a quarter.” It wasn’t all down-arrow on Friday: Nvidia is trading up on the day.

Title: Nvidia's stock slide kicked its market cap out of the $3 trillion club

Despite delivering another record quarter, Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) fell out of the $3 trillion market cap club after some unimpressed investors were left wanting more. Nvidia’s stock was up by around 1.4% during morning trading on Friday at around $121 per share, leaving the firm with a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap. Still, the chipmaker’s shares fell in early trading on Thursday after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.16%), Intel (INTC+2.40%), and other chip rivals also saw declining shares. “What seems to be driving the share reaction is that it’s yet another typical Nvidia report where they beat and raise expectations,” Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. “For them to have this track record of doing that every time, in some way almost works against them as the market is not impressed unless it is a blowout beat and raise.” The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Its full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is $3 Trillion Nvidia (NVDA) A Value Stock?

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia’s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald’s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company’s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, “The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we’re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute." For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia’s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels—etch and deposition tools—needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia’s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam’s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.

After it delivered another record quarter, all eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) announcements at its annual GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell artificial intelligence platform at last year’s conference — known as the GTC — which has now “successfully ramped up” large-scale production and is “achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Demand for the chips, which faced production delays due to design flaws and overheating issues, is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models, according to Huang. On the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call, Huang said he will discuss the company’s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, its next-generation AI platform, Vera Rubin, and its plans for following products at the conference. During the company’s earnings call in May, Huang announced that Nvidia already had another chip coming after Blackwell, and that the company is “on a one-year rhythm.” The following month, Huang announced Blackwell Ultra and the Rubin platform during an appearance at COMPUTEX in Taiwan. During the call with analysts on Wednesday, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The upcoming developers conference will be “another positive catalyst to help solidify the performance advantages of Blackwell and lay a framework for continued AI spending, particularly on the inference side,” Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday. Despite surpassing revenue and guidance expectations, Nvidia’s shares fell on Thursday as some investors were left unimpressed by its results. However, Nvidia is expected to “get the market excited about everything in the product pipeline,” at the GTC next month, John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, shared similar sentiments, saying Nvidia’s “real story is its rapid cadence of innovation,” in comments shared with Quartz. “With GTC around the corner, I expect further product announcements to build on today’s momentum.” The GTC takes place between March 17 and 21, and Huang will deliver his keynote address on March 18.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Predicts the Next Big Thing After ‘Agentic A.I’

A.I. agents may be all the rage right now, but Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is already looking beyond the hype. A.I.’s next phase will be “physical A.I.,” he said during Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call yesterday (Feb. 26). Physical A.I. is a form of A.I. systems that can interact directly with the real world and encompasses products like autonomous vehicles and robots. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Now is the beginning of the agentic A.I. era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it. Then, there’s physical A.I. after that,” Huang told analysts. He went on to explain, “They can’t just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence and cause and effect.” To this effect, Nvidia in January unveiled a platform of “world models,” which attempt to simulate real-world environments. Known as Cosmos, the new platform promises to advance the training of physical A.I. systems by providing highly realistic virtual worlds. Self-driving cars, for example, could be tested across various simulated weather conditions, while robotics companies could examine the safety of their products in different scenarios. Cosmos has already been adopted by robotics companies like 1X and Neura Robotics and autonomous vehicle makers like Waabi and Wayve. The platform is also working with Uber (UBER) as it explores robotaxi products, Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress said yesterday. “Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language A.I., Cosmos is a physical A.I. to revolutionize robotics,” she added. “World models” is a concept picking up steam in A.I. Last year, Fei-Fei Li, a renowned computer scientist and leading figure in A.I. research, founded World Labs, which looks to infuse A.I. with “spatial intelligence” that understands and interacts with the real world. The startup raised $230 million last year and unveiled an early glimpse of its progress in generating virtual 3D scenes from 2D images. For the time being, A.I. developers are heavily focusing on agents, with leaders like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) emphasizing autonomous, action-taking features in recent A.I. releases. Nvidia is doing just fine in the agentic A.I. era. The company’s quarterly revenue surged 78 percent year-over-year to $39.3 billion, the vast majority of which came from its data center business. Profit during the quarter jumped 80 percent to $22 billion. Nvidia’s physical A.I. dreams remain a minuscule part of its business, with its automotive and robotics division accounting for less than 2 percent of the company’s total revenue during the November-January quarter. This share will rise in the future. “Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars,” Huang told analysts, adding that Nvidia will “be improving them using an A.I. factory” powered by physical A.I. Despite exceeding Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and net income, some investors were spooked by Nvidia’s underwhelming gross margin outlook. Nvidia’s stock is down by more than 3 percent today. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) finished the fiscal year by delivering record revenue and outlook above expectations for the fourth quarter — and more than doubling its full-year revenue from the previous year. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s full-year revenue grew 114% year over year to a record $130.5 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, adding that demand for the new chips is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. According to Nvidia’s 10-K filing, just three anonymous customers made up more than 30% of total revenue for the fiscal year ended in January. “Direct Customer A” accounted for 12% of total revenue, while Direct Customers B and C each represented 11%, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Direct Customer B made up 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, the filing said. All of the sales “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” according to the filing. For the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia had reported revenue of $35.1 billion — 36% of which came from three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, according to the company’s Form 10-Q. The filing also showed that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. Although the chipmaker will not disclose the companies, its top customers could likely include Alphabet (GOOGL+0.12%), Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta (META+0.42%), Microsoft (MSFT0.00%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%).

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) delivered another record quarter and raised outlook on strong demand for its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, confirming that Big Tech’s big spending on AI will continue, analysts said. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Fiscal first quarter guidance was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “It was logical to be concerned about the ramping of Blackwell, but we have now successfully ramped Blackwell,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a post-earnings appearance on CNBC (CMCSA+0.95%). Huang added that he believes Nvidia is “successfully behind the air pocket” in demand over which investors raised concerns as customers transitioned from Hopper to Blackwell. “We’re going to have a good quarter next quarter. And we’ve got a fairly good pipeline of demand for Blackwell,” Huang said. Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that “[t]he supply chain should continue to improve,” and that they “see no signs of demand issues,” for Blackwell. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “The recent setback in Nvidia’s stock from DeepSeek and the narrative that AI demand would decline proved unfounded as customers continue to race to scale AI infrastructure, largely with Nvidia chips,” Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, also said he doesn’t think DeepSeek will “clobber demand for Nvidia’s data centre chips” in comments shared with Quartz. The chipmaker’s expectations for the current fiscal year “look to be about right which combined with the good visibility that I think the company has means that there will be few surprises this year,” Windsor said. Meanwhile, concerns by investors over Nvidia’s top customers designing their own custom chips “appear overdone,” Sun said. “Nvidia’s ecosystem advantages and software stack remain formidable barriers to entry.” On its post-earnings call, Nvidia said the reasoning AI models over which firms such as OpenAI and Google are competing “can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.” The company “is uniquely positioned to capture this exponential growth,” Sun said.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.16%), Micron (MU+1.00%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%), and Intel (INTC+2.40%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-1.62%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. Technology company Nvidia will report fourth-quarter earnings today after the closing bell. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia, the chipmaker that fueled 22% of the S&P 500’s total returns in 2024 with a 171.25% stock surge, continues to ride the AI wave into 2025. Its latest quarterly earnings, released after market close Wednesday, showcase a company still firing on all cylinders—yet the market’s response hints at a maturing narrative. With the stock down 2.24% year-to-date entering earnings, investors are wrestling with whether Nvidia’s meteoric rise can sustain its momentum amid economic uncertainty and shifting tech priorities. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, covering the period ending January 26, 2025, smashed expectations. The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, a 78% leap from $22.1 billion a year ago and a 12% increase from the prior quarter’s $35.1 billion, according to a press release issued by Nvidia. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.89, up 82% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share matched at $0.89, a 71% annual gain. The data center segment, Nvidia’s AI powerhouse, soared to $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year, driven by booming demand for its Blackwell and Hopper GPU platforms. CEO Jensen Huang touted the results on the Q4 earnings call, saying, “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law—increasing compute makes models smarter.” The Blackwell platform, ramping up to “massive-scale production,” contributed billions in sales this quarter alone, per Huang’s remarks. Since November 2024, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have traded sideways, with all three posting negative year-to-date returns. The S&P 500, tethered to these giants, has stalled alongside them as the U.S. economy faces turbulence with incoming policy shifts—tariffs, tax changes, and deregulation—under a new administration. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT 12-Month Returns The two-year rally in Big Tech, propelled by artificial intelligence hype, could be hitting a ceiling as firms pivot from raw compute power to efficiency. Innovations like DeepSeek’s compute-light AI models suggest a future where Nvidia’s dominance might face pressure. Competitors such as AMD and Intel are developing alternatives to Nvidia’s AI offerings. AMD’s Instinct MI300 series has secured adoption in cloud computing environments. However, Nvidia’s ecosystem, supported by its CUDA software platform and established partnerships with major hyperscalers, continues to hold a leading position in the AI chip market. Optimists eyeing AI’s secular growth might see Nvidia’s dip as a buy signal, but broader exposure could be wiser. The Nasdaq and S&P 500—down 3.1% and 1.8% year-to-date, respectively, per today’s close, are laden with AI-adjacent firms, offering upside with less single-stock risk. Nvidia’s Q4 2024 earnings cement its AI supremacy—$130.5 billion in fiscal-year revenue, up 114%, speaks for itself. But as the market digests its maturity and braces for economic twists, the era of unchecked gains may be cooling. Investors should weigh diversification and patience in this volatile new chapter.

Title: Nvidia beats fiscal fourth quarter expectations on Blackwell demand

Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) revenue and outlook topped analysts’ expectations, driven by demand for its new Blackwell chips. The stock fluctuated in after-hours trading after closing up 3.7%. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year and an all-time high. Consensus had been for $38.1 billion. Net income was $22 billion for earnings per share of 89 cents, also beats. Nvidia’s full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. The company’s gross margins will be in the low 70s, but is expected to return to the mid-70s later in the fiscal year as Blackwell fully ramps up, CFO Colette Kress said on Nvidia’s earnings call. Nvidia’s data center revenue rose 93% year on year to a record $35.6 billion last quarter. However, data center sales in China remain low due to restrictions, Kress said, adding that the company will continue complying with chip export controls. Ahead of the earnings, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up production of its Blackwell chips — despite shockwaves from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. In December, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. The startup’s powerful reasoning model, R1, spooked investors in January, causing Nvidia’s stock to plunge 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told Quartz ahead of the results. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet.” Encouraging updates on production and shipments of the Blackwell platform will probably move the stock, Kunjan Sobhani, lead semiconductor analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Quartz ahead of earnings. Investors are wary of a potential “air pocket” in growth between the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year as customers move to Blackwell from Hopper, he said. “That is the spot when the Hopper shipments could really come down, and the Blackwell ramp — from a quarter to quarter perspective — might not be enough to show significant sequential growth,” Sobhani said, adding that Blackwell could “catch up in the second half.” For Nvidia’s reputation and valuation, “the sequential expectations matter,” Sobhani said. “If they say something which agitates this sort of concern further, that could imply temporary volatility in the sentiment and the stock.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. stocks gave up their early gains to close mixed on Wednesday as U.S. bond yields fell again amid confusing comments from Donald Trump about tariffs on Canada and Mexico and after more lackluster economic data. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock ended up 3.67% ahead of its earnings later today. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were little changed and the Dow Jones Industrial average lost about 188 points. Apple (AAPL+0.89%) stock fell 2.7% and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%) closed about 4% lower at $290.80, giving up earlier gains. The president pushed back the deadline for tariffs on the U.S.’s neighbors to April 2 from March 4. While this buoyed the Mexican peso and the loonie, it left investors uncertain and skeptical about Trump’s actual plans for duties, and may have reduced the issue’s importance for traders going forward. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. Shares of AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged after an attack by two short-sellers. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000.

Title: Nvidia earnings live updates: Wall Street watching chip demand and guidance around DeepSeek

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

U.S. stocks erased early gains on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s highly anticipated earnings report. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 0.2% and 0.01%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial index shed 0.4%. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000. Here are stocks to watch today: AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged in New York trading on Wednesday after two short-seller reports that questioned the integrity of its AI-driven AXON advertising software. Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research both issued reports that claimed the company, which offers marketing services to app developers, had misrepresented the advantages of its AI platform and was misleadingly “force-feeding” app installations to users’ phones to inflate revenue. Axon (AXON-0.38%) stock surged after the weapons and surveillance technology company reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and issued upbeat full-year guidance. Axon posted adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, topping the analysts’ average of $1.40. Revenue climbed to $575.1 million from $544.3 million a year earlier. Intuit (INTU+1.39%) stock rose sharply following a strong earnings report and mixed guidance for the current period. The tax preparation and accounting software provider posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.32 for its fiscal second quarter, well above the estimated $2.57. Revenue reached $4 billion, surpassing expectations of $3.8 billion. NRG (NRG-0.98%) Energy stock jumped after the power utility holding company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66% stock gained as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Salesforce (CRM-0.05%), a leading customer relationship management technology provider, rose ahead of its earnings report, scheduled for release after the market closes. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. Tesla (TSLA+3.07%) shares gave up early gains on Wednesday, extending their recent decline The company’s market capitalization has dropped below $1 trillion.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged more than 16% Wednesday morning after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. The San Jose-based company filed its delayed annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, along with quarterly earnings for the periods ending Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, after the market closed on Tuesday. “Today’s filings represent an important milestone,” said CEO Charles Liang. He added that the company is heavily investing in talent and processes across key departments to drive its mission in DLC, Data Center Building Block Solution (Supermicro 4.0), and revenue goals. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro’s stock has been on the rise, especially following its latest earnings report filed earlier this month. The report showcased a strong outlook and an ambitious 2026 target, drawing investor interest. Currently, the stock is trading around $53 per share, marking a 76% gain this year. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. However, Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The crypto market is looking to regain some poise after yesterday's tumble with on-chain indicators showing signs of capitulation in bitcoin. Some tokens, like MakerDAO's MKR, stand out with a 20% gain in 24 hours, thanks to the DAO's buyback and burn process. IP, the native token of decentralized intellectual property-focused blockchain Story Protocol, is also in the green, having risen nearly 40%. The token's price has doubled in two weeks after being listed on South Korean exchanges. Other notable outperformers include Celestia's TIA along with XDC, QNT and HYPE. Data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows whales have been buying the dip in the HYPE token. XRP, meanwhile, is hanging on to a key Fibonacci level, keeping bulls' hope for bigger gains alive. According to Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the crypto market is digesting the end of the recent memecoin frenzy, which could be replaced by productive sectors such as stablecoins, real-world assets and DeFi. "But until they start making their presence felt, the loss of energy will create a drag on the market," Hougan said on X. On the macroeconomic front, the optimism seen after the Nov. 4 election is being replaced by caution, as evidenced by Tuesday's release of the U.S. consumer confidence. The gauge dropped to an eight-month low, and the one-year inflation expectations were highest for 1.5 years, with President Donald Trump's tariffs singled out as the primary concern in almost every household and business survey. The dour sentiment and a strengthening yen might keep the upside in risk assets restricted for some time. Earlier this week, Belgium's central bank's head, Pierre Wunsch, warned that the ECB risks sleep-walking into too many rate cuts. The Fed, for its part, is unlikely to do QE anytime soon. (Sure, the January meeting minutes discussed an end of quantitive tightening, but that does not mean quantitative easing.) Speaking of key events to watch out for, the Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis, is set to revisit crypto regulations during Wednesday's scheduled hearing titled “Exploring Bipartisan Legislative Frameworks for Digital Assets."

Title: NVIDIA Insiders Sell $1.6 Billion Of Stock, Buy Nothing A Year Ahead Of Today’s Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With NVIDIA due to report another highly crucial earnings results later today, data shows that insiders have sold as much as $1.6 billion in stock over the year heading into the results. Investor hype surrounding NVIDIA's shares and its ability to drive the AI revolution has meant that the stock become the most valuable in the world multiple times ahead of last month's DeepSeek selloff. However, since then, NVIDIA's shares have failed to regain their lost glory as investors remain on the sideline to gauge demand for its products before buying more stock. Since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT, NVIDIA's shares have been on a tear and have been among the top performers on Wall Street. Since November 2022, they have gained 678% and led to many of the firm's employees becoming millionaires. The richest NVIDIA employee is CEO and founder Jensen Huang who owns 3.5% of the shares of the company that he set up in 1993. Huang is the 13th richest person in the world and is currently worth $113 billion. NVIDIA, on the other hand, is worth $3.1 trillion and is the second most valuable company in the world. Ahead of it is Cupertino, California, consumer technology giant Apple Inc, which leads by $600 billion on the market capitalization pyramid and is worth $4.7 trillion. However, NVIDIA sat at the top of the pyramid in January before the DeepSeek selloff recalibrated the stock market. Its shares lost 17% during the day, and while they have gained 6.9% since the DeepSeek bottom, the stock is yet to reach its previous highs. The firm's upcoming earnings report is expected to set the tone for its GPU demand and Blackwell availability for the rest of the year. So far, the consensus among investors is that Blackwell deliveries have been pushed into the second half of the year. NVIDIA's shares reflect the unease, as they have lost 9.62% in the days heading into the earnings. NVIDIA insiders also appear to have sold billions of dollars of stock over the year heading into the earnings. As per data shared on X, they have sold $1.6 billion of stock heading into earnings. Some notable sales include those by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and chief financial officer Collette Kress. For instance, Huang sold $8.62 million of shares in mid-December when the stock was trading at $135 while Kress cumulatively unloaded $18.62 million worth of shares on the same day. Another notable insider that has sold the stock is NVIDIA's field operations lead Ajay Puri who has sold more than $40 million worth of shares. NVIDIA's less-than-stellar share price performance ahead of the earnings has made the stock quite cheap, according to investment advisory Evercore ISI. In a fresh investment note, the firm kept a $190 share price target and an Overweight rating on the shares as it shared that with a 30x forward-price-to-earnings multiple, NVIDIA's shares were the cheapest in its AI coverage universe. BREAKING: In the last year, Nvidia, $NVDA, insiders have only sold. They have sold up to $1,602,674,927.72 in stock.

Title: Amid an Uncertain Year, Can Nvidia Soothe Wall Street’s Nerves?

Nvidia (NVDA) has had a bumpy start of 2025. Share price of the A.I. chip giant surged to record highs at the beginning of the year and then fell sharply in late January after the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley. Now, analysts are eagerly anticipating Nvidia’s fourth-quarter and 2024 financial results, set to release tomorrow (Feb. 26), to gauge its actual position in the A.I. race. Nvidia is the world’s second most valuable public company with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion, meaning its earnings report could also have major implications for the broader stock market.

You can opt out anytime. Wall Street expects Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to soar 72 percent to $38 billion and profit to jump 64 percent to $19.6 billion. But to keep its share price on an upward trajectory, the company might have to do even better. To avoid a sell-off, Nvidia must meet its “normal exceed,” Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, told Fortune. While DeepSeek’s cost-efficient breakthrough initially led investors to believe demand for A.I. chips could fall, some analysts have pushed back on such fears. “We believe that A.I. GPU demand still exceeds supply, so while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this A.I. ‘gold rush,’” said Brian Colello, a Morningstar analyst, in a January note. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek in a recent interview for “making everybody take notice” of opportunities for more efficient A.I. models. While the initial market response suggested Wall Street was losing faith in compute investments, Huang claimed “it’s exactly the opposite,” given the “fairly compute-intensive” nature of reasoning-focused models like DeepSeek’s R1. But Nvidia stock took another hit on Feb. 21, falling 4 percent after the investment bank TD Cowen reported that Microsoft has cancelled leases for at least two data center operators. The news sparked concerns over a decline in demand for A.I. compute. “It points to a potential oversupply position,” said TD Cowen analysts in the report. In response, Microsoft noted that it is “well positioned” to meet increasing demand but may “strategically pace or adjust” its infrastructure in some areas. Nvidia’s earnings come amid a broader market downturn. Last week, major indexes saw their worst day this year so far in response to weaker-than-expected economic reports on the U.S. services sector and consumer sentiment. But when it comes to A.I., tech bulls are confident that Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will put an end to Wall Street’s caution. While the market is “heavily skewed negative right now around tech sentiment,” Nvidia’s upcoming performance should “calm the nerves of investors,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a client note. Updates on Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip and demand from Big Tech clients will continue to fuel optimism towards the technology, Ives added. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to spend more than $300 billion cumulatively this year on A.I. efforts, including buying Nvidia chips. “After speaking with many enterprise A.I. customers, we have not seen one A.I. enterprise slow down or change,” said Ives, who added that no clients want to “lose their place in line” for Nvidia’s next-gen chips. During Nvidia’s last earnings call in November, Huang noted that Blackwell production was “in full steam.” The success of Nvidia’s transition to its next-gen GPUs will be closely watched when the company reports earnings tomorrow. “All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary,” according to Hans Mosemann, an analyst with Rosenblatt who predicts that Huang will reaffirm that demand for shipments remains high throughout 2025. “We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger [second half].” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Wall Street eyes 'growing pains' in Nvidia earnings but all eyes are on a bullish 2nd half for its next-gen chip

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

The Nasdaq Composite index fell almost 1.4% on Tuesday after February consumer confidence missed expectations, coming in at 98.3 compared with the consensus of 103.0, and down from 105.3 in January — the worst decline since August. U.S. government debt rallied and the dollar weakened. The Nasdaq fell about 260 points. The S&P 500 dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by about 160 points . Money markets are now fully pricing a more than two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, Bloomberg News reports, even after 12-month average inflation expectations surged to 6% from 5.2%, partly driven by concern about tariffs. The Magnificent 7 shares declined more than 2% as a group. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and Super Micro (SMCI-4.70%) shares fell in New York trading on a report — following declines in Japanese chipmakers including Tokyo Electron in Tokyo — that the U.S. is seeking tighter chip restrictions on China. Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy (MSTR+5.23%), plunged 11%, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $88,000, with other cryptocurrencies pacing the decline. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token. Chegg (CHGG+12.80%) stock fell 33% after the online learning platform filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively affected its traffic and revenue. Home Depot (HD+0.82%) rose 2.8% after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year. Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.66%) stock dove 22% even after the millennial-focused telehealth company reported soaring sales for 2024 last night.

As Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.33%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+0.42%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY-2.67%), Alibaba (BABA-3.21%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC+3.88%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG+12.80%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-1.38%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+0.78%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD+0.82%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR+5.23%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token.
