Title: Nvidia earnings updates: Investors brace for Q3 results, with the stock down 10% in November
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-q3-earnings-live-updates-nvda-stock-price-ai-chips-2025-11

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia."

It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

November 19, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary NEW YORK, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into solar design platforms is accelerating as companies work to automate and enhance the solar project lifecycle. With AI, design platforms can instantly analyze satellite imagery, shading, roof geometry, and energy consumption patterns to create highly customized system proposals. This integration reduces the time needed for manual surveys and engineering work, making project initiation much faster. It improves accuracy, helping installers minimize errors in system sizing, equipment selection, and installation planning. Companies adopting AI-driven design tools are positioning themselves to handle higher project volumes with fewer resources. A report from Grand View Research said that the global solar AI market size was estimated at USD 5.96 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 18.43 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 20.8% from 2025 to 2030. The report had key Market Trends & Insights: “North America solar AI market dominated the global industry and accounted for a 36.8% share in 2024; Based on technology, the machine learning segment dominated the industry and held a 49.9% share in 2024; Based on application, the Smart Grid Management segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; Based on end use, the industrial segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; North America: Largest market in 2024; Asia Pacific: Fastest growing market.” A.I. Companies active in the markets this week include: PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). The Grand View Research report continued: “AI models are significantly transforming the solar energy industry by improving forecasting accuracy, which is crucial for optimizing energy production and consumption. By integrating real-time weather data with historical energy trends, these models provide more precise predictions about solar energy generation. This enhanced forecasting allows grid operators to better manage the distribution and storage of energy, ensuring that supply meets demand efficiently. As solar energy is intermittent, having accurate predictions helps prevent imbalances and reduces the risk of grid instability or blackouts. AI-driven solutions also enable more effective use of energy storage systems, ensuring that excess energy produced during peak sunlight hours is stored and used during low-generation periods. The integration of solar energy, battery storage, and artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming important in the renewable energy market, especially for grid decarbonization… AI models help optimize when and how energy should be stored or distributed, ensuring a consistent flow of carbon-free power, even during non-peak production hours. With growing investments in energy storage and AI capabilities, the solar sector is evolving into a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable energy market. This trend signifies a shift toward more advanced grid integration technologies that will drive the next wave of clean energy innovation.” PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) and Smartlink AI (“Orbit AI”) to Launch the First “Orbital Cloud” for AI Infrastructure into Space PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (“PowerBank” or the “Company"), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is collaborating with Orbit AI in the launch of a revolutionary space initiative known as the Orbital Cloud — where communications, compute, and verification converge in LEO powered by Solar energy. The mission leverages cutting-edge satellite technology, high-performance AI compute hardware, blockchain verification systems, and clean-energy solutions to demonstrate a next-generation digital infrastructure in orbit. Strategic Vision - Orbit AI is developing DeStarlink, the first decentralized low-Earth-orbit network for global connectivity, and DeStarAI, a suite of orbital AI data centers powered by solar arrays and naturally cooled in space. Together, these systems form the Orbital Cloud, a unified infrastructure layer designed to enable sovereign, censorship-resistant connectivity and in-orbit compute services. Through its collaboration with Orbit AI, PowerBank intends to contribute advanced solar energy systems and adaptive thermal control solutions, reflecting its broader shift toward digital asset, data center, and RWA (Real World Asset) infrastructure, where solar power supports digital infrastructure deployments and high-growth AI markets. PowerBank’s contribution focuses on solar power and adaptive thermal technologies essential to future satellite’s “Execution Layer.” “The next frontier of human innovation isn’t just in space exploration, it’s in building the infrastructure of tomorrow above the Earth,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank. “The combined markets for orbital satellites, in-orbit data centers, blockchain verification, and solar-powered digital infrastructure are projected to exceed $700 billion over the next decade. By integrating solar energy with orbital computing, PowerBank is helping create a globally sovereign, AI-enabled digital layer in space, which is a system that can help power finance, communications, and critical infrastructure.” “Orbit AI is creating the first truly intelligent layer in orbit — satellites that compute, verify, and optimize themselves autonomously,” said Gus Liu, Co-Founder and CEO of Smartlink AI. “The Orbital Cloud turns space into a platform for AI, blockchain, and global connectivity. By leveraging solar-powered compute payloads and decentralized verification nodes, we are opening an entirely new potentially $700+ billion-dollar market opportunity — one that combines energy, data, and sovereignty to reshape industries from finance to government and Web3. PowerBank’s expertise in advanced solar energy systems will be significant in supporting this initiative.” As Jeff Bezos recently commented at Italian Tech Week, Turin, Italy, October 2025[1]: “We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centres in space in the next couple of decades. These giant training clusters will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7 — no clouds, no rain, no weather. It already has happened with weather and communication satellites. The next step is going to be data centres and then other kinds of manufacturing.” CONTINUED… Read this and more news for PowerBank Corporation at: https://powerbankcorp.com/news/ In other recent developments and happenings in the Artificial Intelligence market include: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stepped back into the U.S. bond market for the first time since 2022, raising $15 billion as it continues pouring money into AI infrastructure. The company issued the debt in six parts, according to an SEC filing, giving itself extra room to fund acquisitions, boost working capital, pay down existing debt and, if needed, support stock buybacks. Demand for the deal was huge right out of the gate. People familiar with the sale told Bloomberg that orders climbed close to $80 billion before easing once borrowing costs improved during the process. Even with the cooldown, the enthusiasm shows how willing investors are to back Big Tech's AI ambitions. It isn't just Amazon: Alphabet recently sold $25 billion across the U.S. and Europe, Meta raised $30 billion in October and Oracle secured $18 billion earlier this year. China approved the first foreign automaker generative-AI services this week, clearing Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) to offer in-car AI assistants to Chinese drivers. Regulators in Shanghai registered Tesla's xBot customer-service model, while Beijing's cyberspace authority listed Mercedes-Benz's virtual assistant. The approvals let both firms deploy voice assistants that handle customer queries, navigation and media controls after meeting local cybersecurity, data-localization and content-safety requirements. Volvo's cockpit assistant also secured registration in Shanghai, showing regulators will accept foreign models that localize operations. Marking a new era of industrial innovation, SymphonyAI, a global leader in Vertical AI product platforms, announced a milestone integration of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Omniverse™ libraries into its IRIS Foundry DataOps platform and IRIS Forge application builder, running on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure cloud and edge infrastructure. Unlike static digital-twin tools, this integration brings live industrial data into 3D digital twins developed using Omniverse libraries, enabling teams to simulate entire plants or production lines in minutes instead of weeks—reducing the time to insight and accelerating operational improvements. Unveiled at Microsoft Ignite, this integration brings together transformative 3D modeling, real-time simulation, and enterprise-grade AI to accelerate digital transformation for refineries, manufacturers, energy producers, and process industry leaders worldwide. As industrial organizations increasingly move from AI pilots to full-scale production, they face complex challenges: how to visualize and optimize diverse, distributed operations in real time; how to break down data silos across sites and assets; and how to empower teams with actionable insight for better, faster decisions. This solution—integrating NVIDIA Omniverse libraries into IRIS Foundry, running in Microsoft Azure—enables users to build dynamic applications within minutes using IRIS Forge. These applications support collaborative simulations, 3D visualizations, and interactive modelling, while enhancing operational intelligence and allowing one-click deployment to the Azure cloud. Built on Microsoft Azure’s cloud and edge infrastructure, the integration uses Azure Kubernetes Service for orchestration, Azure Entra ID for secure access, Azure Edge Runtime for near-real-time processing, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for native connectivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams.

Title: Why Nvidia's Earnings Report Wednesday Is More Important Than You Think

A lot is at stake when the world's most valuable public company reports earnings Wednesday. Nvidia's (NVDA) latest quarterly financial update, due after the closing bell, is being widely viewed as the biggest event of this earnings season. It could have wide-reaching implications for the AI trade and the broader stock market. A strong showing from the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, viewed as a bellwether for the industry, could prove just what the market needs to revive confidence in the AI rally that boosted shares of Nvidia, its partners, and stocks across industries this year, pushing the major indexes to a series of record highs. However, with expectations riding high and signs investors may be more difficult to impress amid persistent worries that elevated stock valuations have created an AI bubble, the stock could be primed for punishment if Nvidia's results are anything less than stellar. Nvidia's quarterly results and outlook could sway sentiment surrounding a host of stocks tied to the AI boom. The chipmaker's outsized influence on major indexes and funds that track them also means a big move in its stock would affect a wide range of investors. With the chipmaker facing a particularly challenging setup heading into Wednesday night's event, some investors are already bracing for enhanced volatility in its wake. Options pricing suggests traders see shares swinging roughly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. Nvidia's outsized influence on major indexes—with a market capitalization of around $4.4 trillion, the stock accounts for about 8% of the S&P 500—also means a big move in its stock would impact the market broadly. And if Nvidia's shares soar or slump, those of its partners and others related to AI likely will too. Even if you don’t hold Nvidia stock directly, a big share price move could affect you if you hold money in broad market index funds through brokerage accounts or tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA. Options pricing indicates traders expect the S&P 500 could move close to 2% in either direction by the end of the week, affecting a wide swath of investors and savers. In recent quarters, the AI chipmaker's quarterly report has tended to be a sell-the-news event, with the stock finishing the week of its earning lower than its levels heading into the event in three of the last four quarters, despite strong results. However, Nvidia's stock has typically picked up in the months that followed. The shares, which slid nearly 3% Tuesday amid broader losses, have still added over one-third of their value this year so far. Most Wall Street analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha believe the stock has room to rise.

Title: Peter Thiel's Hedge Fund Dumped Nvidia Shares Just Before Its Big Earnings Report
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/peter-thiel-s-hedge-fund-dumped-nvidia-shares-just-before-its-big-earnings-report-11851890
Time Published: 2025-11-18T21:25:01Z
Full Content:
While everybody is watching for Nvidia’s earnings report tomorrow, a few big investors have already taken their chips off the table. Thiel Macro, tech titan Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, revealed in a regulatory filing late last week that it sold its entire stake in the AI bellwether during the third quarter. The 537,742 shares the firm held heading into the quarter would have been worth approximately $100 million at the end of September. While people may sell assets for all sorts of reasons, Thiel joins a growing list of heavy hitters whose Nvidia (NVDA) moves have lately raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Japanese investment firm SoftBank revealed last week that it sold its entire Nvidia stake in October, raising about $5.8 billion. (Executives said the position was liquidated to fund investments in another AI darling, OpenAI.) Nvidia, which dominates the market for accelerated computing chips, has benefited more concretely from the AI investment boom than nearly any other U.S. company. An increasingly bearish outlook for its stock could spell trouble for more speculative AI bets. Some investors aren't waiting for its next earnings report to make that call. Others have outright bet against Nvidia. Scion Asset Management, run by Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager of “The Big Short” fame, revealed earlier this month that it sold short Nvidia shares valued at $186 million in the third quarter. (Scion also had a short bet against Palantir (PLTR), the data analytics firm Thiel founded in 2003, valued at more than $900 million at the end of the quarter.) Some on Wall Street are increasingly worried that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble. They point to elevated stock valuations, uncertainty about AI's revenue potential, and a series of circular deals between vendors and customers as causes for concern. AI bulls contend that valuations are modest compared with the Dotcom Bubble, to which the current investment cycle is frequently compared, and remind skeptics that AI investment is being driven by hugely profitable tech businesses. The bubble debate has weighed on AI sentiment and stocks heading into one of Wall Street's most important recurring events: Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. High-flying AI stocks like Palantir, Applovin (APP), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are among the S&P 500's worst performers over the past week. Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT) fell Tuesday even after they announced a cloud computing deal with startup Anthropic, the kind of tie-up that months ago might have been sure to boost socks. Nvidia shares have fallen more than 10% since late October, when it became the first company in history to be worth $5 trillion. Nonetheless, Wall Street's expectations are still high heading into Wednesday's report, with analysts predicting big tech's aggressive investments will drive a solid quarter for the chipmaker.

Shares of a major home improvement retailer lost ground after it missed quarterly profit forecasts, indicating homeowners are putting off remodeling projects amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, strong demand and procedure volumes helped drive a strong earnings report for a medical device company, and its shares advanced. Major U.S. equities indexes dropped for the second straight day ahead of several high-profile earnings reports and the release of delayed jobs data due later this week. The S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, the Dow slid 1.1%, and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%. Click here for more reporting from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Home Depot (HD) stock tumbled 6% to log the worst performance in the S&P 500 after the home improvement retailer missed forecasts with its third-quarter earnings, noting that a lack of storms during the period weighed on its performance. The company also lowered its full-year profit forecast, citing persistent headwinds in the housing market and suggested that homeowners are pushing back remodeling projects amid broader economic uncertainty. Concerns about high valuations for companies in the artificial intelligence space weighed on the tech sector. Shares of Western Digital (WDC), the hard disk drive maker that has drawn attention from investors given its opportunity to help satiate AI's massive data storage needs, fell 5.9% Tuesday. Shares of memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) lost 5.6%. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) shares slipped 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively, as regulators in the European Union announced that they were launching investigations into cloud computing services offered by the two tech giants. The move lower for Microsoft stock also came as the software giant announced a partnership with AI startup Anthropic. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a deal with Anthropic as well. Nvidia shares slid close to 3% Tuesday ahead of the chipmaker's highly anticipated earnings release Wednesday afternoon. Medtronic (MDT) stock advanced about 5% after the medical device maker topped analysts' estimates with its fiscal second-quarter sales and adjusted profit. The manufacturer of pacemakers and other cardiovascular devices also lifted its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth, highlighting strong procedure volumes and a positive demand picture across its end markets. Merck (MRK) announced positive results from a Phase 2 trial of a key heart treatment, and shares of the pharmaceutical company jumped nearly 4%. In the study, Merck's Winrevair met its primary endpoints in helping patients with certain heart conditions reduce pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs.

Title: Wall Street analysts are still bullish on Nvidia heading into Q3 earnings, even as investors turn skittish
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-q3-earnings-preview-nvda-stock-wall-street-estimates-ai-2025-11

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return.

High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia."

It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

Title: Nvidia and Microsoft Just Teamed Up For a Massive AI Deal. Is It The Latest Sign of an AI Bubble?

Big artificial intelligence deals aren’t what they used to be. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday announced a partnership with private AI startup Anthropic that will see the latter buy $30 billion of cloud computing capacity from Microsoft and contract up to 1 gigawatt of additional capacity. The first gigawatt of Anthropic’s commitment will run on Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. In exchange, Nvidia and Microsoft have agreed to invest up to $10 billion and $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic. The deal expands a web of entanglements between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators that has elicited suspicion on Wall Street. Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, which vowed to buy or lease 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia chips. OpenAI has also committed to acquiring 6 GW of chips from Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which, as part of the deal, awarded OpenAI stock warrants that could give the ChatGPT maker a nearly 10% stake. Nvidia upped its investment in CoreWeave (CRWV) when the cloud computing provider went public in March, and, in September, agreed to buy all of CoreWeave’s excess cloud capacity until 2032. Tech stocks and enthusiasm for AI have propelled the stock market higher for much of the past three years. Those stocks, which now account for a sizable share of the major stock indexes, have struggled lately due to fears about an AI bubble. These and other agreements raised concerns that the AI craze on Wall Street was being fueled by splashy deals that overstate the size of the industry and demand for its services. At the same time, investors have become increasingly concerned that AI revenue won’t compensate big tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) for their massive data center investments anytime soon. AI stocks used to skyrocket on deals like the one announced Tuesday, but debates around the AI bubble have weighed on sentiment lately. Shares of Nvidia, which is due to release its quarterly results on Wednesday, were down more than 1% in early-afternoon trading and have lost about 10% of their value since the start of the month. Microsoft stock was recently down 3%, putting it about 9% off its recent record high.
