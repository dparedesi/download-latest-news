Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 hit records as tech surges, Fed's Powell says economy in 'remarkably good shape'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A tech rally boosted US stocks on Wednesday, with all three major indexes hitting new record closes, as investors digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that US economy is in "remarkably good shape." The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed about 0.7%, or over 300 points, to close above 45,000 for the first time ever. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.6% for a fresh closing high of 6,086.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 1.3%, clinching a record of its own at 19,735.12. Cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) hit intraday all-time highs on Wednesday, as did iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) gained over 3%, nearing its own record. Salesforce (CRM) stock surged 11% after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its artificial intelligence products. Markets kept moving higher as Powell spoke at the New York Times DealBook Summit and did little to shake investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates at its December meeting. Powell touted a US economy in "remarkably good shape" as a reason he feels the Fed can be "afford to be a little more cautious" in its interest rate cutting path. The central bank is widely expected to lower rates at its Dec. 18 meeting. Traders see near 77% odds of a 25 basis point cut, compared with around 67% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. On that economic strength: A reading on private payrolls suggested the labor market is softening — but not too much. The report is one of several key economic releases this week, leading into the all-important monthly jobs report on Friday. In corporate news, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) halted its investor day after the CEO of insurance unit UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy All three major indexes clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday while bitcoin (BTC-USD) headed for a milestone of its own. The world's largest cryptocurrency quickly gained steam in the afternoon, nearly touching $100,000 per coin for the first time ever, as investors digested President-elect Donald Trump's nomination for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin's prior all-time high is $99,655.50 per coin. Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, who is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official. The former SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. The labor market has showed signs of further cooling in the second half of 2024. But there have still be an occasional signs of labor market tightness within data, as seen in a Wednesday release from ADP. New data from ADP released Wednesday showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers rose to 7.2% in November, up from 6.7% in October. Meanwhile, the year-over-year pay increase for job stayers rose to 4.8% from 4.7% the month prior, marking the first monthly increase in wage growth for job stayers in 25 months. "Job changers are the most sensitive to real time labor market conditions," ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told Yahoo Finance. "So if they're getting paid a little bit more in November than they did in October, that tells you that there's a labor market out there that's still a little tight. And that is meaningful to the fed." Specifically, Richardson added, it could be a challenge for a Fed that's already been digesting inflation prints that have shown little progress in recent months. "As long as you have sticky inflation and strong wage growth, you can't be on a preset course to cutting rates, because that could come and bite you later," Richardson said. "So I think they're still going to be very cautious, very data dependent." A rally in megacap tech helped lift US equities on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied more than 3% while Amazon (AMZN) popped more than 2%. All of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this week, with each stock rising more than 2% in the past three trading days compared to the benchmark index's less than 1% gain. We recently highlighted that these stocks have also been seeing stronger earnings revisions over the past month compared to the S&P 500, perhaps one of the driver's behind the recent market action. "US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings," DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a recent note. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that recent economic data could lead to a "cautious" interest rate-cutting cycle. In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell said the US economy is in "remarkably good shape." Given that, and how recent data has calmed concerns over how rapidly the US labor market is weakening, Powell believes the Fed won't need to rapidly cut interest rates while the central bank waits for inflation to fall to its 2% goal. "We can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," Powell said. Over the past few years, a stronger-than-expected US economy has continuously surprised Wall Street and its projections. While we've become somewhat used to them now, the recent underestimations are a reversal of what was seen prior to the pandemic when US economic forecasts were often too lofty, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Yahoo Finance. And now, heading into 2025, strategists like Calvasina are leaning into the post-pandemic trend and betting consensus economic forecasts will once again be surprised to the upside by the US economy. "Given that history recently of underestimating [US economic growth] and the fact that GDP forecasts for next year are creeping up very, very, very slowly, I'm making a bet on the 2% to 3% [growth] instead of the 1% to 2%," said Calvasina, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 6,600. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey issued the most bullish target on Wall Street at 7,007 while highlighting a "cyclical opportunity catalyzed by upward GDP revisions." If 2024's market driving abbreviation was AI, 2025's is set to be GDP. Read more here. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Atkins, currently the CEO at Patomak Global Partners, served as SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration from 2002 to 2008. Unlike his potential predecessor Gary Gensler, who is set to leave office in January 2025, Atkins is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official and currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. "He's certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro-digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry," Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) moved slightly higher on the news and was trading just north of $96,000 per coin in afternoon trade. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) touched intraday record highs on Wednesday as markets edged higher, buoyed by tech stocks. The S&P 500 Tech sector (XLK) outperformed, jumping about 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed after a strong quarterly report from software maker Salesforce (CRM). UnitedHealth Group (UNH) released a statement Wednesday following the fatal shooting in Manhattan of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson," read the company statement. "Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.” Thompson was shot outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where the company was holding its investor day. UnitedHealth halted the event this morning following the shooting. President-elect Donald Trump has asked Peter Navarro to be senior counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. Navarro served under Trump's first term as White House trade adviser. "I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing," wrote Trump on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. "During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American," wrote Trump. Amazon (AMZN) hit an all-time high on Wednesday amid the company’s AWS re:Invent 2024 cloud conference. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant rose more than 2% in early trading. On Wednesday, numerous Wall Street analysts reaffirmed their bullish Buy ratings on the stock, citing the company's artificial intelligence capabilities. The stock has 77 Buy ratings, 5 Holds, and zero Sells. Amazon shares are up 43% year to date. Foot Locker (FL) shares tumbled 12% in early trading after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance while missing third quarter estimates, citing weak consumer demand. "Consumer spending trends softened following the peak Back-to-School period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated," the company said in its quarterly release. The stock is down more than 30% year to date. US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, as tech rose, led by shares of Salesforce (CRM). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.4%, or around 200 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3% on the heels of an all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.7%. Salesforce (CRM) stock climbed around 8% in early trading after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its AI products. Investors await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's appearance in New York on Wednesday afternoon.

Title: Fei-Fei Li’s Startup Allows You to Walk in the 3D World of Edward Hopper Paintings

World Labs, a startup co-founded by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li earlier this year that quickly grabbed the attention of high-profile investors, has remained relatively quiet on its products—until now. The startup yesterday (Dec. 3) provided a glimpse of one of its early projects, which takes the form of virtual 3D scenes generated from a 2D image. “This will change how we make movies, games, simulators and other digital manifestations of our physical worlds,” said World Labs in a blog post accompanied by interactive examples of its 3D worlds. The preview shines a light on Li’s larger efforts to develop A.I. models that have “spatial intelligence” and can understand and interact with the real world. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Based on images of landscapes, urban scenes and even artwork from painters like Vincent van Gogh and Edward Hopper, World Labs creates entire 3D worlds that users can explore—albeit with some barriers, such as a limit on how large the interactive area is. According to the startup, this 3D content provides more control than typical 2D A.I. content, as it allows users to adjust aspects like field of depth or play with camera dolly zooms. Often referred to as the “Godmother of A.I.” for her contributions to the field, Li in the 2000s played a large role in the release of ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that helped kickstart pivotal advances in machine learning. She is currently on partial leave from her role as co-director of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered A.I. to work on World Labs, which Li established earlier this year alongside fellow A.I. researchers Justin Johnson, Ben Mildenhall and Christoph Lassner. The startup in September raised some $230 million in a round led by Radical Ventures, a Canadian venture capital firm where Li serves as a partner, with the participation of Andreessen Horowitz and NEA. Other World Lab investors include “A.I. godfather” Geoffrey Hinton, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn (LNKD) co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, and Nvidia (NVDA)’s venture capital arm, NVentures. World Labs’ primary goal is developing the ability to take action with vision or perception within A.I. models—a type of intelligence that took 540 million years to evolve in the human brain. “If we want to advance A.I. beyond its current capabilities, we want more than A.I. that can see and talk. We want A.I. that can do,” Li said during a TED Talk in April. This week’s initial preview is just an early look at what World Labs hopes to eventually accomplish. The company said it has offered early access to its technology to digital content creators like Eric Solorio and Brittani Natali. “We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them,” said World Labs.

Title: Sam Altman isn't worried about Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump

Time Published: 2024-12-04T16:43:00Z

As his former colleague and artificial intelligence rival prepares for a role in the incoming Trump administration, Sam Altman says he’s not worried about Elon Musk. Despite there being “lots of things not to like about” Musk, it would go against the billionaire’s values to hurt competitors, the OpenAI chief executive said during an interview at the New York Times (NYT+0.37%) DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “I may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.44%) reported that Altman and other tech and business leaders who have drawn Musk’s ire are worried about the influence he could have on regulation. Altman reportedly reached out to his connections in Trump’s circle, including the President-elect’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua Kushner, head of major OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. Altman also reportedly asked a mutual friend to set up a meeting with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 before leaving over a conflict of interest in 2018, announced in September that his AI startup, xAI, had brought “the most powerful AI training system in the world” online after only 122 days. The Colossus training cluster is powered by 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) H100 training chips and “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H200 chips, Musk said. Altman said he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor” to OpenAI. “I have different feelings about him [Musk] now, but I’m still glad he exists,” Altman said. “Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think he, at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously.” Additionally, Altman said ChatGPT’s search feature is his “favorite product we’ve launched in a long time,” and that OpenAI will announce new launches and demos for the next 12 business days starting on Thursday.

Title: Barron’s Analyst Predicts AI Shift from Training to Inference Could Impact NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s GPU Dominance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. AI companies in Europe are competing with American counterparts for a larger slice of the AI cake in Asia and the Middle East. For example, French AI firm LightOn recently revealed plans to expand in the Middle East, targeting sectors such as banking, defense, and high-tech which require their data to be protected on local servers. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Laurent Daudet, the CEO of the firm, noted that banking, insurance, high-tech, defense, and healthcare were prime targets for the custom AI models from LightOn. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The report further highlights that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries were among those being looked at by LightOn. The AI firms just recently debuted on the stock market, becoming the first listed genAI company on the Euronext Growth exchange. The demand for LightOn products is growing. Per Orange AI Chief Steve Jarrett, customers want a French-trusted AI solution.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Finance news expert Adam Clark recently opined in a piece for finance publication Barron’s that the focus of the AI industry will inevitably shift from training to inference as AI firms face challenges in their quest to build ever-larger AI models. This shift, per Clark, has big implications for NVIDIA. In his piece, the author noted that while training was uniquely suited to the company's GPUs, inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from NVIDIA peers like AMD and Intel, by custom chips from Amazon, or by a range of chip start-ups. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Amazon Web Services (AMZN+1.11%) unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence training chip that it says is faster and expected to use less energy. Trainium3 is the first chip from AWS built with the 3-nanometer process — so far the most advanced semiconductor technology — that allows for better performance and power efficiency. The first Trainium3 chips are expected to be available late next year, AWS announced at its re:Invent conference on Tuesday. UltraServers powered with Trainium3 are expected to perform four times better than those powered by its Trainium2 chips, AWS said, “allowing customers to iterate even faster when building models and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” The cloud giant’s Trainium2 chips, which are four times faster than its predecessor, are now generally available, AWS said. The Trainium2-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances allow for 30% to 40% better price performance than current chips, and feature 16 Trainium2 chips. The new Amazon EC2 instances are “ideal for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters,” AWS said. The cloud giant said it is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trainium2-powered UltraServers with AI startup Anthropic called Project Rainier. In November, AWS announced it was following up a previous $4 billion investment in the AI startup with another $4 billion. In the next phase of the partnership, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary AI training partner. “Trainium2 is purpose built to support the largest, most cutting-edge generative AI workloads, for both training and inference, and to deliver the best price performance on AWS,” David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, said in a statement. “With models approaching trillions of parameters, we understand customers also need a novel approach to train and run these massive workloads. New Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS and help organizations of all sizes to train and deploy the world’s largest models faster and at a lower cost.” AWS chief executive Matt Garman also announced the next-generation P6 family of instances from Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) and AWS, featuring the chipmaker’s new Blackwell chips. Blackwell has 2.5 times faster compute than current generation of graphics processing units, or GPUs, Garman said.

Title: Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger may get more than $10 million in severance pay

Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:26:00Z

Outgoing Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to get paid as much as $10 million as he exits the struggling tech giant. Gelsinger will receive 18 months of his base annual salary of $1.25 million, or $1.8 million, and 1.5 times his target bonus of $3.4 million, or $5.16 million, which will be paid out over the next 18 months, Intel (INTC-5.26%) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gelsinger will also receive a payment equal to 11/12ths of his 2024 bonus — which is subject to company performance — that he would have received had he not resigned. That would be a little more than $3 million. His departure comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) in the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest, including a potential takeover bid, as its performance has lagged. In early November, Intel was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to make room for Nvidia, which has been hailed as an “AI darling.” Intel’s stock has fallen by more than 52% in 2024 as of Tuesday, while its rival’s stock has surged by more than 188%. Although Gelsinger’s resignation was announced Monday morning, it came after what CNBC reports was a contentious board meeting over a lack of confidence in the CEO’s plans to compete with Nvidia. Gelsinger had served as the company’s first chief technical officer before leaving the company. He returned in 2021 to take over for then-CEO Bob Swan in an attempt to stabilize and modernize the company. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” he said.

On 12/5/24, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and NXP Semiconductors will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. NVIDIA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 12/27/24, Qualcomm will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.85 on 12/19/24, and NXP Semiconductors will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.014 on 1/8/25. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $138.63, this dividend works out to approximately 0.01%, so look for shares of NVIDIA to trade 0.01% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 12/5/24. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.52% lower in price and for NXPI to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, QCOM, and NXPI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. NVIDIA: NVDA Qualcomm: QCOM NXP Semiconductors: NXPI In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.03% for NVIDIA, 2.09% for Qualcomm, and 1.74% for NXP Semiconductors. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, NVIDIA shares are currently up about 0.3%, Qualcomm shares are up about 2.8%, and NXP Semiconductors shares are up about 1.9% on the day.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025

Senior businessman in suit flying in private jet and listening to music via wireless earphones. If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

Title: An Intel Break-Up Could Follow Its CEO Shake-Up, Bank of America Says

Intel (INTC) could break up its operations after CEO Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement was announced Monday, according to Bank of America analysts. The analysts wrote Monday that Intel's internal manufacturing business and the foundry business that makes chips for other companies are now more likely to be separated, as the outgoing CEO was a proponent of keeping them together. Such a shake-up would still face a number of hurdles, like the strings attached to the nearly $8 billion in federal CHIPS Act funding announced last week. The BofA analysts said that the funding agreement dictates that Intel needs to retain at least a 35% stake in its foundry business. "Both businesses are undergoing their own strategic, structural, financial, and competitive issues, with no near term solution in sight," the analysts wrote, maintaining their "underperform" rating and $21 price target on the shares. Intel's stock finished Monday slightly lower. While Intel shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year, some of the company's few bright spots have come from reports of potential investments or acquisition offers, or after the chipmaker sold pieces of some assets. Bloomberg and Reuters reported Monday that Gelsinger met with the chipmaker's board last week over its concerns about the company's turnaround effort and its progress in catching up to competitors like Nvidia (NVDA)—and allegedly was given the choice to retire or be fired.

Title: AI Is All Picks And Shovels, No Gold

When it comes to AI you may be better off betting on the the suppliers—the “pick and shovel” ... [+] providers. Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock—along with the sell offs—for almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived—like the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today’s almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns: This last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI? AI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM’s Watson to ChatGPT’s ability to mimic human conversation, we’ve come a long way in “narrow AI” advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of “general AI”—a system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that. Why is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you’ll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain—running on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists—is still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While “breakthroughs” dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists—the coders—tinker with existing frameworks. But you can’t invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the “pick and shovel” providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, “When everyone is looking for gold, it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high—fueled by a fear of being left behind—the pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don’t think this trend can continue indefinitely. At its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense—embedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience—remains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy. Here are two early warning signals I have used as AI sell triggers: DeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth’s pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Great Enlightenment—that forces a reevaluation of today’s runaway spending—has begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum. While riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard. Disclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.

After an independent review revealing no board or audit committee misbehavior, Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financials) shares soared about 30% on Monday. The Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) partner will replace its CFO in line with improvements in governance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Initiated after auditor Ernst & Young resignation for governance and internal control issues, the special committee's review found no need for financial restatements. Since then, Super Micro has hired BDO USA as its new auditor and sent Nasdaq a compliance report meant to stop delisting. Over three months, the assessment turned significant procedural flaws but no proof supporting Ernst & Young's claims. Former vice president of finance Kenneth Cheung has been appointed chief accounting officer per committee recommendations. To improve governance, the business intends to name a new general counsel, chief compliance officer, and chief financial officer. Super Micro does not plan to restate financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 or other years; it intends to achieve Nasdaq's listing criteria within the discretionary time. Super Micro has been especially close to Nvidia, incorporating its GPUs into its server systems to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning uses. This cooperation has improved Super Micro's standing in the market for artificial intelligence servers. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

After nearly four years of attempting to turn around Intel’s struggling semiconductor business, Pat Gelsinger is out as the company’s CEO. His resignation ends a tenure marked by plunging profits and a failure to capitalize on the A.I. boom that lifted rivals like Nvidia. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” said Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board member who will act as its interim executive chair in light of Gelsinger’s departure, in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Gelsinger, 63, stepped down as CEO and left Intel’s board effective yesterday (Dec. 1), the chipmaker announced today in a press release. David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, two senior Intel executives, will act as co-CEOs while the company’s board works to find a permanent successor. Zinsner is currently the company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of head of Intel Products and will oversee its client computing, data center and A.I., and network groups. Intel shares rose 4 percent today in response to the news. The resignation caps more than 30 years at Intel for Gelsinger, who first joined the company as a teenager in 1979 and went on to become its first chief technology officer at the turn of the century before leaving Intel in 2009. After taking a senior position at the tech company EMC and serving as the CEO of the cloud computing player VMware, Gelsinger in 2021 returned to Intel to take over from then-CEO Bob Swan. Despite ambitions to regain Intel’s leadership in the semiconductor industry, the company in recent years has failed to catch up with competitors and has seen its share price plunge by about 50 percent in 2024 alone. At the center of Gelsinger’s turnaround plan was a strategy to branch into contract manufacturing to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier to U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and Qualcomm. In the meantime, the company has also pivoted to making A.I. accelerators to compete with industry leaders like Nvidia, but with little success—Intel’s current market cap is only 3 percent of Nvidia’s. Intel is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which is awarding the company nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants to expand its domestic manufacturing network—about a quarter of Intel’s cost of goods sold in 2023. Gelsinger’s ousting also came amid rumblings of activist investor interest in Intel. The company, which in October reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, reportedly tapped advisors like Morgan Stanley (MS) earlier this year to defend itself from activist pressure. “Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” said Gelsinger in a statement. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The tech-driven Nasdaq reached a high on Monday, driven by gains by Intel and Tesla (TSLA+3.17%), getting December off to a good start after a November that was the best month of 2024 for both the Dow and S&P 500. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.27% and the Nasdaq climbed 1%. This week, investors will see a diverse range of earnings reports from tech, meme stock, and entertainment companies. Salesforce (CRM-1.82% is set to release its earnings report Tuesday after the market closes. GameStop (GME+5.96%), a popular meme stock, will also report earnings Wednesday, and Lululemon (LULU+0.79%), which has been facing challenges due to sluggish sales, will report its earnings Thursday after the closing bell. In addition, the November jobs report will be released later this week. Shares of Intel (INTC-5.26% jumped 5% as the company announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chip-maker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. Tesla shares rose 3% after Roth MKM upgraded the stock from “Neutral” to “Buy,” setting a price target of $380 (up from $85). The firm cited the potential impact of CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump as a catalyst for the upgrade, suggesting it could bolster Tesla’s prospects in the coming months. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.52%) soared 23% on Monday morning following the announcement that an independent special committee had concluded its investigation into the company’s operations and found no evidence of misconduct by the company’s management or board of directors. –Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(INTC, Financials) announced that co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus would succeed Pat Gelsinger, who will retire on Dec. 1. Gelsinger also left Intel's board. INTC stock is up 4% in Monday morning trading following the news. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MU. Holthaus will also assume the newly established Intel Products CEO post. Frank Yeary is designated temporary executive chair. Intel is trying to become more competitive in semiconductor production and negotiate continuous obstacles, including pressure on its foundry operations, hence the leadership transition comes as natural. Previously running Intel's Client Computing Group, Holthaus will concentrate on centralizing resources for the product group. Joined Intel in 2022 Zinsner, a former executive vice president and CFO of Micron Technology (MU, Financials). KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts said that the action would show Intel's readiness to sell its foundry business, a prospect considered positive by some investors. Analyzers also pointed out the difficulties in selecting a leader suited to handle Intel's wide-ranging problems. Intel has had challenges growing its foundry operations to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM, Financials) and understood pressure from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD, Financials) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) in artificial intelligence. Aiming to save $10 billion in expenses and simplify operations, the business announced in August a 15% personnel cut. Intel reported a net loss of $0.46 per share in the most recent quarter as income dropped 6.2% year over year to $13.28 billion. Foundry income fell 8% to $4.4 billion during the same time frame. Part of its cost-cutting initiatives, the corporation also noted a $2.8 billion restructuring expense. Under the CHIPs Act, Intel this week earned a $7.86 billion grant, a drop from an earlier $8.5 billion allocation to improve manufacturing headquartered in the United States.

Intel (INTC-5.26%) shares climbed by over 4% during mid-day trading on Monday after the company announced that its chief executive is out. After over four decades at the chip pioneer, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger retired from the company and stepped down from its board of directors on Sunday, Intel said. Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner and chief executive of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus will now serve as interim co-CEOs while Intel’s board looks for another leader. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board, will become its interim executive chair. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. Intel’s shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+1.74%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm’s (ARM-2.37%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger’s stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel’s Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion — less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon — an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired effective Dec. 1 and stepped down from the company's board of directors. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. Intel stock was up roughly 5% on the news midday before reversing direction. Shares fell as much as 2% in afternoon trading. A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that the board had lost confidence in Gelsinger and a change was needed ahead of 2025. The person added the decision was made by a small group of people inside Intel, and the leadership team was only made aware Sunday afternoon. It's unclear if Intel will continue with Gelsinger's expensive expansion into making chips for other companies, the source said. Intel has named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. The company said its board has formed a search committee and “will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.” “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Intel's board chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Intel is facing two separate lawsuits filed this year by investors claiming they were misled about the company's financial performance. The latest was filed by a pension fund in August following the chipmaker's announcement that it would slash 15,000 jobs. Gelsinger had previously spent 30 years at Intel but left in 2009. He rejoined the company in 2021, taking over the role of chief executive from Bob Swan. Gelsinger promised that his tenure would bring back a “Grovian” mindset to the company and right years of missteps that saw Intel lose its edge in the chip market to artificial intelligence chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA) and chip manufacturing giant TSMC (TSM). That goal referred to former CEO Andy Grove, who oversaw a spectacular turnaround for the company in the 1980s when Intel struggled to maintain its dominance in the memory chip market amid competition from Japan — and made a dramatic shift toward producing another kind of chip, called CPUs, of which it became the leading manufacturer. Many of the problems facing Intel predate Gelsinger's tenure and will remain a challenge for its next leadership group. Intel is grappling with a slump in PC chip sales that’s only just beginning to improve and increased competition in that market from AMD (AMD) and British chip designer Arm (ARM), all while the CPU market as a whole is threatened by the rise of GPU chips, which are used to run generative artificial intelligence — a market dominated by Nvidia. As Intel CEO, Gelsinger sought to bolster the company's foundry business by making chips for external customers. Intel makes its own chips but had never produced semiconductors for external customers, and its own chipmaking processes faced delays beginning in the mid-2010s. Gelsinger undertook aggressive efforts to improve Intel's manufacturing processes — which he outlined at the start of his time as CEO in 2021 — that aimed to reverse the foundry's former failures in five years. Intel has recently focused on upgrading to a manufacturing process called 18A that would allow it to directly compete with TSMC as a producer of AI chips. Gelsinger's departure casts doubt on the company's focus on its service foundry, which could affect Intel's ability to catch up in the AI space, according to analysts. "[W]hile keeping [the foundries] feels like deadweight (and a continuation of the strategy that got Pat out), scrapping them would also be fraught with difficulties around the product roadmap, outsourcing strategy, CHIPS act, and political navigation," Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note Monday. In late November, Intel was officially awarded $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding for its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also recently announced plans to split its foundry business into an independent subsidiary, and Gelsinger's exit could accelerate that change, according to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri. The move toward Intel's money-losing chip manufacturing business has so far failed to bolster faith in the company. Intel has recently become a takeover target, and shares of the company are down more than 50% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 26%. Intel stock was recently replaced by Nvidia in the Dow. As Bernstein's Rasgon wrote, "There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride."

Manage your account Intel (INTC) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Trump's plan to slash the corporate income tax rate for domestic manufacturers would fuel a multitrillion investment while he's in office. Nvidia topped analyst estimates across all metrics on its third quarter earnings call. Nvidia continues to be the runaway leader in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI). The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present. $83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. A falling-interest-rate environment is generally a positive catalyst for the stock market. Having said that, there are some areas of the stock market that tend to benefit from falling rates more than others. One in particular is real estate, and it could be a great time to shop for top-notch real estate stocks while the Federal Reserve is still in the early stages of its rate-cutting cycle. Advanced Micro Devices could disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the market for data center chips.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two of the most popular stocks among retail investors, but the billionaires listed below bought one and sold the other in the third quarter. Cliff Asness at AQR Capital Management purchased 719,710 shares of Nvidia, increasing his stake by 5%. Nvidia is now the largest holding in the portfolio, and Apple is the second largest. The chipmaker is considering at least two people outside the company to replace former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who abruptly retired on Sunday.

Intel on Thursday named two chip industry veterans to its board, as the struggling semiconductor firm looks for a new top boss following the recent ouster of Pat Gelsinger and tries to reclaim its lost glory. The chipmaker said Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, are the new additions to its board.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seizing the moment as Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) value edges closer to the $100,000 mark, up 129% this year. At a press conference on Tuesday, Adams had a pointed message for his skeptics: "Remember y'all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin? Who's laughing now?"

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot trend for investors all year, and as a result, popular AI stocks have been on a tear.

The analyst in question is Citibank's co-head of U.S. software equity research, Tyler Radke, who has been following Microsoft since 2021. XRP has seen a massive surge in value, increasing by over 439% in the past month and 86% in the last week to reach $2.70, its highest level since 2018. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both are playing key roles in one of today's hottest growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power critical tasks such as the training and inferencing of models, along with many other related products and services. Supermicro is a behind-the-scenes player, integrating these and other top AI chips into its servers and workstations for data centers. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) stock gained a lot of attention recently after it was added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of stock holdings. While investors love to follow Warren Buffett's moves, it likely wasn't his stock pick given the relatively small size of the purchase.

Last quarter, a modest revenue and earnings beat was not enough to prevent a massive sell-the-news event, but that didn’t happen this time. This might be the case today with Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), which took a hit after its recent fiscal third quarter earnings. In its third quarter, Dell saw revenue grow 10% to $24.4 billion, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share grew 14% to $2.15. While that marked pretty solid growth given Dell's mature business lines, that revenue figure actually fell just short of analyst estimates. Nvidia may be looking to buy other companies to expand its capabilities. In a recent conference, its CFO specifically mentioned the prospects for growth through mergers and acquisitions. It's been an extremely challenging few years for Boeing (NYSE: BA), and its recovery under new CEO Kelly Ortberg isn't going to be a quick fix. The backlog is there, and Boeing continues to win orders, so what can investors expect from Boeing in 2025? It may seem like a bit much that a legendary company like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), led by Warren Buffett, might change its investing strategy solely based on who is in the Oval Office, but he has already given a fairly clear answer on this subject. If there is such a change in strategy, it would be based on just one thing: taxes. If Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidency, there was a fairly high likelihood that the corporate tax rate would have been increased from its current 21%. The Macy’s employee, who is no longer with the company, hid delivery expenses during the course of almost three years. Right now, Bitcoin is getting all the attention in the crypto market. Bitcoin soared by nearly 40% in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, and is now up 128% for the year. The one that's on my radar right now is Bittensor (CRYPTO: TAO), an artificial intelligence (AI) crypto token. Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) more than tripled over the last 12 months, with most of that gain coming in just the last three months. Since the beginning of September, the stock has rocketed 134% at the time of this writing and commands a rich valuation of 64 times trailing-12-month revenue and 187 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. It's fair to say Palantir might be the most loved artificial intelligence (AI) stock on Wall Street right now. Palo Alto, California-based Broadcom is among the biggest beneficiaries of hefty demand for AI-supporting hardware, as so-called hyperscalers turn to its custom chips to diversify their supply chains beyond Nvidia's costly processors. The technology, called 3.5D XDSiP, will allow Broadcom's custom-chip customers to boost the amount of memory inside each packaged chip and speed up its performance by directly connecting critical components. There are five products in development that use the new tech, with production shipments starting in February 2026, Broadcom said. Brian Thompson dumped more than $15 million in stock before a federal antitrust investigation into the insurance giant was publicly revealed, a lawsuit claims. US president Joe Biden made a mistake in not embracing Elon Musk, his predecessor Bill Clinton has said, after the Tesla boss donated millions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

Intel (INTC-5.26%) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA+0.61%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.04%) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Bezos Expeditions, the Amazon (AMZN+1.11%) founder’s private investment vehicle, was part of a $693 million funding round for Tenstorrent, the company announced Monday. He joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in the round led by South Korean firms Samsung Securities and AFW Partners. “We are excited by the breadth of investors that believe in our vision,” Keith Witek, the chief operating officer of Tenstorrent, in a statement. “If you look at this group, you see a balance of financial investors and strategic investors, as well as some notable individuals that have conviction in our plans for AI.” Tenstorrent said it will use the money to “build out open-source AI software stacks, hire developers, expand its global development and design centers, and build systems and clouds for AI developers.” The company has strived to provide more accessible and affordable solutions for companies looking to develop their AI capabilities, putting itself in direct competition with fellow Santa Clara, California-based firm Nvidia. So far, it has signed about $150 million in contracts, Tenstorrent said. Currently the second-most valuable company in the world behind Apple (AAPL0.00%), Nvidia is a Wall Street powerhouse and a behemoth in the AI chip space. Last month, it reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, with 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — coming from only three unnamed customers. Those sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to filing. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google (GOOGL-1.02%) parent Alphabet, Meta (META-0.82%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.22%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.17%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. But smaller companies are struggling to build up their AI capabilities as Big Tech firms corner the market — and power-hungry AI chips remain prohibitively expensive. That’s where Tenstorrent is hoping to come in. Founder and CEO Jim Keller told Bloomberg that Tenstorrent uses open-source and commonplace technology to provide engineering solutions that put AI in reach for more firms, and skips costly and complex parts, including like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used by Nvidia. “You can’t beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they’ll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.” Open-source technology has become increasingly popular amid the AI boom, given its cost effectiveness. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company’s first open-source, multimodal large language model, Llama 3.2, will be the way forward. “It’s sort of like the Linux of AI, and we’re seeing closed-source labs react by trying to slash their prices to compete with Llama,” he said at Meta’s annual Connect conference in September. Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI also made its chatbot, Grok-1, an open-source model. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he’s willing to work with President-elect Donald Trump to dismantle government regulations that hinder economic growth. The U.S. imposes “excessive permitting and regulation,” Bezos said, speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday. “We need a growth orientation in this country.” The day after … The Amazon founder said that he is working on a plan to turn around the Post: "We saved the Washington Post once, this will be the second time." Trump's plan to slash the corporate income tax rate for domestic manufacturers would fuel a multitrillion investment while he's in office. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two of the most popular stocks among retail investors, but the billionaires listed below bought one and sold the other in the third quarter. Cliff Asness at AQR Capital Management purchased 719,710 shares of Nvidia, increasing his stake by 5%. Nvidia is now the largest holding in the portfolio, and Apple is the second largest. Nvidia topped analyst estimates across all metrics on its third quarter earnings call. Nvidia continues to be the runaway leader in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI). The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present. $83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other stocks that can do well in December according to Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently […] A falling-interest-rate environment is generally a positive catalyst for the stock market. Having said that, there are some areas of the stock market that tend to benefit from falling rates more than others. One in particular is real estate, and it could be a great time to shop for top-notch real estate stocks while the Federal Reserve is still in the early stages of its rate-cutting cycle. Advanced Micro Devices could disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the market for data center chips. The benchmark stock indexes keep climbing to new heights, but there are plenty of attractive wallflowers at this dance. A couple of overlooked dividend payers offer high yields and reliable dividend payout growth, but you wouldn't know it by looking at their stock prices. Shares of W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) and Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ: RPRX) were beaten down to 52-week lows not long ago, and they've only recovered a little. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is proving to be a game-changing technology and with it, several companies are emerging as winners in this sector of the economy. The stocks for many of these companies have already seen large gains. Let's look at five AI stocks that could be set to continue to run higher in the coming years. The chipmaker is considering at least two people outside the company to replace former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who abruptly retired on Sunday. Billionaire Israel Englander is the CEO of Millennium Management, the second-most profitable hedge fund in history in terms of net gains since inception, according to LCH Investment. Englander sold 1.6 million shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), cutting his position by 13%. Nvidia stock returned 705% over the last two years.

The start-up is trying to revolutionize the quantum computing market and bring this nascent technology into commercial hands. With investors eating up growth and deep technology stocks at the moment, it is no surprise to see IonQ crushing the market in 2024. While total dividends matter to investors, it's always nice to receive frequent payments. Finding companies that pay dividends monthly can also help with your budgeting based on the timing of your bills (e.g., monthly rent or mortgage payments, utility bills, etc.). Real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a fertile source for finding qualifying stocks that pay monthly dividends. As global markets continue to reach record highs, buoyed by positive economic indicators and geopolitical developments, investors are increasingly seeking stable income sources amid fluctuating policy landscapes. In this context, dividend stocks offer an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on steady returns, particularly in a market environment where traditional growth avenues may face uncertainties. A change in presidential economic policy generates curiosity and concern about the direction and flow of interest rates or which economic sectors could flourish under the upcoming administration.... The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the Nasdaq, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are heading for 26%, 29%, and 18% increases, respectively, this year. The S&P 500 roared into the new year by confirming its presence in a bull market and went on to hit multiple record highs. Now, Intel needs to focus on efficiency, the company's chief global operations officer said on Wednesday. Everyone knows Warren Buffett is famous for being frugal. This is the billionaire who still lives in the same house he bought in Omaha in 1958 for $31,500 and is perfectly content eating McDonald's breakfast most mornings. But what's it like to be on the receiving end of his gift-giving? Turns out, it's a mix of practical, surprising and downright hilarious. Don't Miss: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Inspired by Uber and Investing $5,000 can be a good amount to put into a growth stock because it can lead to significant long-term gains. Three stocks that I think could be good growth stocks if you have $5,000 to invest today are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL). Here's why these can be ideal options for growth investors, particularly if you're looking for good value buys, as well. After being largely ignored by the market for several years, at least in terms of the stock price, SoFi's (NASDAQ: SOFI) stock performance is finally starting to reflect the bank's excellent growth momentum and future potential. Here's a rundown of where the business stands now, some future growth catalysts to keep an eye on, and why the recent stock performance could be just the beginning.

Intel on Thursday named two chip industry veterans to its board, as the struggling semiconductor firm looks for a new top boss following the recent ouster of Pat Gelsinger and tries to reclaim its lost glory. The chipmaker said Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, are the new additions to its board. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seizing the moment as Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) value edges closer to the $100,000 mark, up 129% this year. At a press conference on Tuesday, Adams had a pointed message for his skeptics: "Remember y'all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin? Who's laughing now?" Adams, who took his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) upon assuming office in January 2022, faced ridicule at the time. Don’t Miss: The global games market is projected to ge In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant wave of liquidations, totaling more than $588 million. Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors just increased its stake in a very successful S&P 500-themed ETF. Two of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers find themselves on opposite ends of the spectrum with one America's leading financial institutions. This November, millions of Americans voted to bring Donald Trump back to the White House. Many of them made their decision based on the belief that he would strengthen the economy. However, many... XRP has seen a massive surge in value, increasing by over 439% in the past month and 86% in the last week to reach $2.70, its highest level since 2018. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both are playing key roles in one of today's hottest growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power critical tasks such as the training and inferencing of models, along with many other related products and services. Supermicro is a behind-the-scenes player, integrating these and other top AI chips into its servers and workstations for data centers. If you're looking for inspiration when it comes to investing principles, you would be hard-pressed to find a better blueprint than Warren Buffett's strategy. The "Oracle of Omaha" has sage advice for... Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) stock gained a lot of attention recently after it was added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of stock holdings. While investors love to follow Warren Buffett's moves, it likely wasn't his stock pick given the relatively small size of the purchase. Instead, it was likely bought by one of Berkshire's two other investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs. Take a closer look at these bargain-bin value stocks, quality dividend stocks, and one scorching-hot growth stock. UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside of a Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan earlier this morning, a "brazen, targeted attack," according to a statement by the New York Police Department.

Salary, down payment, insurance, PMI, and taxes are all factors. Last quarter, a modest revenue and earnings beat was not enough to prevent a massive sell-the-news event, but that didn’t happen this time. Malicious actors suspected to be from China, nicknamed Salt Typhoon, hacked into telecommunication companies such as AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. This might be the case today with Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), which took a hit after its recent fiscal third quarter earnings. In its third quarter, Dell saw revenue grow 10% to $24.4 billion, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share grew 14% to $2.15. While that marked pretty solid growth given Dell's mature business lines, that revenue figure actually fell just short of analyst estimates. The hardware side is ready, at least. The company has denied allegations of improprieties and has given its accounting a clean bill of health. Nvidia may be looking to buy other companies to expand its capabilities. In a recent conference, its CFO specifically mentioned the prospects for growth through mergers and acquisitions. Sam Altman, CEO of artificial-intelligence power player OpenAI, believes that the next major developments in the AI sector will be more disruptive than people expect. Altman, speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday, predicted that as soon as 2025 the industry will begin to see the first examples … It's been an extremely challenging few years for Boeing (NYSE: BA), and its recovery under new CEO Kelly Ortberg isn't going to be a quick fix. The backlog is there, and Boeing continues to win orders, so what can investors expect from Boeing in 2025? Ford, along with some other automakers, has a bit of a creepy history with wanting to track people’s every movement. That strange saga continues with news of the Blue Oval filing a patent for a tracking system that works even if someone disables tracking on the vehicle. A big Cybertruck design flaw has been exposed. Just like any technology, we can see how such a thing could be used for good or ill. For example, a lot of thieves disable factory GPS trackers when they take a car, so being able to It may seem like a bit much that a legendary company like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), led by Warren Buffett, might change its investing strategy solely based on who is in the Oval Office, but he has already given a fairly clear answer on this subject. If there is such a change in strategy, it would be based on just one thing: taxes. If Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidency, there was a fairly high likelihood that the corporate tax rate would have been increased from its current 21%.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
