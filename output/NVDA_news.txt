Title: Wall Street analysts are still bullish on Nvidia heading into Q3 earnings, even as investors turn skittish
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-q3-earnings-preview-nvda-stock-wall-street-estimates-ai-2025-11

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

CFRA reiterates its strong buy rating for Nvidia and maintains its bullish $270 price target. DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

The analyst urged investors to "stay the course" with Nvidia stock, maintaining a price target of $230, 28% higher than current levels. Bank of America believes Nvidia remains undervalued, given its dominance in the AI hardware space. Analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a buy rating and updated the bank's per-share estimates for the coming fiscal year to $4.56, $7.02, and $9.15 per share. While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their slide Tuesday afternoon, amid worries about an AI bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were down about 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. Home Depot (HD) shares fell 4% after the home-improvement retailer reported disappointing third-quarter earnings and cut its full-year profit outlook.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday, were down 3%. Microsoft (MSFT) shares were also about 3% lower after the two Magnificent 7 members announced partnerships with Claude AI developer Anthropic. Nvidia and Microsoft said they will invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic as part of the deals. Medtronic (MDT) shares rose 4% after the maker of medical devices reported better-than-expected fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook.

Stock futures are lower Tuesday morning after major indexes fell sharply to open the week; Home Depot reported lower quarterly profits than analysts had expected; Apple's new iPhone 17 gave the smartphone maker its best month of market share in China in three years; Nvidia stock is moving lower again as investors prepare for the chipmaker's results; and buy now, pay later firm Klarna posted its first earnings report since going public in September. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open Tuesday after each of the major indexes lost ground in Monday's trading session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were recently down 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, while those connected to the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.6% amid ongoing concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble (see more below). Bitcoin was at $91,300, after falling to a seven-month low overnight below $90,000. Gold futures were down 1% at $4,030 an ounce, while crude oil futures fell slightly to just under $60 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.11% recently, down from 4.13% late Monday. Home Depot (HD) kicked off a busy week of retail earnings Tuesday morning, reporting a 4 cent year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share to $3.74, while revenue grew 2.8% to $41.35 billion. Sales topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, while adjusted EPS fell short by 10 cents. CEO Ted Decker said the retailer believes its results fell short of its own expectations because of a continuously weak housing market and a lack of severe storms in the quarter, which hampered demand for home improvement products. Shares of Home Depot, a Dow component, were down more than 3% in recent premarket trading. Other major retailers set to report earnings this week include home improvement rival Lowe's (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Companies (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Gap (GAP) and Walmart (WMT), which announced a CEO succession plan last week. Apple's (AAPL) newest slate of iPhones, the iPhone 17, appears to be boosting the company's efforts to return to the role of market leader in China. The tech giant saw a 37% increase in smartphone sales in the region in the month of October, according to data from Counterpoint Research reported by Bloomberg, as China's overall smartphone market grew 8% in the month. Apple was responsible for about a quarter of smartphones sold in China in October, the first time it has hit that mark since 2022, per Bloomberg. China is a key market for Apple, but the iPhone maker has been losing ground to domestic competitors in recent years. Apple shares, which hit a record high a week ago, were up slightly in premarket trading. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are losing ground again this morning as investors prepare for the chipmaker's highly anticipated earnings report after the closing bell tomorrow. Investors have been rattled recently by growing questions about whether the artificial intelligence boom has created a bubble in the stock market. The AI-fueled rally has turned Nvidia into the world's most valuable company, as it is the recipient of much of the spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). Nvidia is expected to report rising revenue and profits, though investors and analysts will likely be focused more on CEO Jensen Huang's comments about the outlook for demand. Traders are pricing in the likelihood of a big move in Nvidia shares after the earnings report is released. The stock, which fell nearly 2% on Monday, was down about 1% this morning. Klarna (KLAR), a buy now, pay later company that went public in September, released quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates. Klarna said its revenue grew to $903 million, while it lost $0.25 per share in the quarter, each better than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Gross monetary value, or the total amount of products bought with Klarna's services, beat estimates at $32.7 billion, as did its number of active users at 114 million. Shares were up slightly in recent premarket trading. Klarna's stock has trended lower since its IPO in September, but analysts have stayed bullish on the stock.

Nvidia is set to report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday, with traders expecting a big move in the AI chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Nvidia (NVDA) shares could move nearly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that size from Monday's close near $187 could help the shares recover some of their recent losses to return to last week's levels around $199, or pull them down to about $174, a level not seen since September. In recent quarters, Nvidia's earnings have tended to be a sell-the-news event, despite a string of record-breaking results. In all but one of the most-recent four quarters, the chipmaker's stock finished the week lower than its levels heading into the event. With expectations riding high ahead of the earnings, and results from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other AI favorites indicating investors may be harder to impress this season, Nvidia could face an increasingly difficult bar to clear. This year's big rally in AI stocks, which made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company by market capitalization, has fueled worries about an AI bubble, and investors will be watching closely whether the chipmaker can deliver on its ambitious growth targets. Nvidia's earnings release is the most highly anticipated event of the earnings season, and it's likely to have a big impact on the broader stock market. Nvidia is seen reporting adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of $1.26 on a nearly 60% year-over-year jump in revenue to a record $55.4 billion, according to estimates collected by Visible Alpha. Whisper numbers could be even higher, with analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush telling clients recently that they expect the AI darling to "beat and raise," or top analysts' quarterly projections as well as lift its full-year outlook. Still, Wall Street analysts are widely bullish Nvidia's stock has room to rise after a nearly 40% gain in 2025 so far. All but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha call it a "buy," with their mean target near $219 suggesting roughly 17% upside from Monday's close. Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% Monday amid broader tech sector losses.

Title: Targeting Palantir and Nvidia: Profits, Prophets and Overvalued AI Stocks

Photograph Source: Coolcaesar – CC BY-SA 4.0 In an industry of seedy soothsayers, cocksure charlatans and resourceful rogues, honest and accurate appraisals are exquisitely rare. When it comes to economics, investments and finance, this is particularly so. Certitude, however, tends to be in abundance for those predicting the next financial crash, the sort that will singe earnings and strafe savings. Take, for instance, hedge fund investor Michael Burry, a man of sufficient notoriety to warrant a celluloid depiction of himself by Christian Bale in the 2015 film The Big Short. On that occasion, Burry’s hunch, albeit an educated one, was that the US housing bubble would implode in what became the Great Recession of 2007-9. The buccaneering investor shorted mortgage-backed securities ahead of the collapse, raking in profits as the subprime mortgage sundered. But his record is by no means immaculate, seeing falls when they have not eventuated, especially on tech stocks. For him, the language of catastrophe is never far away. An April 7 post on X this year is fabulously bleak: “Millennials going through 9/11, two economic recessions, a pandemic, the looming threat of WW3, AI job automation, and now facing the ‘biggest crash in history’.” Towards the end of October, he felt in an oracular mood: “Sometimes we see bubbles,” he wrote in another post. “Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.” His Scion Asset Management hedge fund subsequently moved 80% of its US$1.1 billion portfolio to place options against Palantir (PTLR) and Nvidia (NVDA). These will pay handsomely should shares in these AI-linked companies fall. Burry remains convinced that technology stocks, certainly when it comes to artificial intelligence, are overvalued and set for the precipitous plummet. Whether this is due to growing scepticism about the herd-like rush to adopt AI, the debate about necessary regulation, or that broader sensibility that what rises or swells so rapidly must fall or puncture, is impossible to know. Certainly, the incestuous circular financing tech companies have been engaging in is crying out for a stinging correction. But it is precisely moves of this nature by Scion Asset Management that send jitters through the market, turning preaching prophets into market saboteurs. Surely enough, Palantir’s shares fell by 8% on November 4 despite exceeding Wall Street estimates of returns for the third quarter. The stocks had risen to skyscraper levels – 173% for the year heading into trading that day. Nvidia’s fell by 4% after having improved by 50% this year. “It seems fatigue over AI and the current earnings run has investors questioning the sustainability of the AI hype,” reasoned financial analyst Farhan Badami. “That’s dragged down AI companies overnight in markets.” Sympathy for such companies is bound to be in short supply. Palantir is the sort of data analytics company any half-decent minded individual would wish to fail. In April this year, 404 Media revealed that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had paid the company millions of dollars to modify the ICE database to enable it to “complete target analysis of known populations” and spruce up the targeting of that tool and enforcement priorities. The database gives ICM agents the means to sort individuals using hundreds of specific categories covering physical attributes, administrative background and mobility. ICE Director Todd Lyons has fantasies of running the agency’s crude, clumsy deportation policy “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings” in an effort to treat the matter “like a business”. This charming dystopian thought is a good pairing with the sinister propaganda Palantir enjoys promoting, including a campaign on college campuses that echoes the stirrings of a Nuremberg rally cry: “Our culture has fallen into shallow consumerism while abandoning national purpose. Too few in Silicon Valley have asked what ought to be built – and why.” Palantir, to that end, was built to conquer such flabby complacency. “On the factory floor, in the operating room, across the battlefield – we build to dominate.” The company CEO, Alex Karp, has been less than impressed by Burry’s short selling efforts. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box in sheer bafflement. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy.” He is confident that any damage will be minimal. “I do think this behaviour is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” The latest fall is being taken with a grain of salt among some investors, though you can hardly trust them. Take the tepid assessment from equity trading strategist at Citi, Vishal Vivek. “A little bit of risk is not going to take the sheen off what’s been a pretty remarkable year, in fact, a pretty remarkable three-year stretch,” he tells Reuters on whether AI stocks were proving less attractive. “If anything, there’s a reasonable chance that you’re going to pause your buying maybe, but you’re not going to necessarily sell your big positions into year-end because you’re worried about one or two companies that have underperformed.” Leaving aside such babble and bloviation, if there is a crash in overvalued AI stocks likely to rival the market falls that took place in the Great Recession, a similar government program used for the banks and banksters will be sought by Karp and company. In the private sector, foolish losses and unscrupulous conduct regarding investments often turns its members into temporary socialists. Profit, on the hand, is the sort of thing that rests firmly and assuredly in the clasping hands of the corporate sector, the result of purported intelligence and industry. That’s private enterprise for you. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He lectures at RMIT University, Melbourne. Email: bkampmark@gmail.com

November 17, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC25—NVIDIA today announced that RIKEN, Japan’s leading national research institute, is integrating NVIDIA GB200 NVL4 systems with two new supercomputers in Japan — one built for AI for science and the other for quantum computing. The first system will deploy 1,600 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, using the GB200 NVL4 platform and interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking, as part of RIKEN’s AI for science initiative. The system will advance research in areas such as life sciences, materials science, climate and weather forecasting, manufacturing and laboratory automations. The second system, dedicated to quantum computing, will feature 540 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs — also using the GB200 NVL4 platform and interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking — to accelerate research in quantum algorithms, hybrid simulation and quantum-classical computing methods. “RIKEN has long been one of the world’s great scientific institutions, and today it stands at the forefront of a new era in computing,” said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing (HPC) at NVIDIA. “Together, we’re helping Japan build the foundation for sovereign innovation that will drive breakthroughs to solve the world’s most complex scientific and industrial challenges.” “Integrating the NVIDIA GB200 NVL4 accelerated computing platform with our next-generation supercomputers represents a pivotal advancement for Japan’s science infrastructure,” said Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. “Our partnership will create one of the world’s leading unified platforms for AI, quantum and high-performance computing, allowing researchers to unlock and accelerate discoveries in fields ranging from basic sciences to industrial applications for businesses and society.” Expanding Partnership With RIKENThe two new RIKEN systems follow the announcement in August that launched a collaboration between Fujitsu and NVIDIA to codesign a flagship supercomputer with the development code name FugakuNEXT, the successor to the world-renowned Fugaku supercomputer. The two new GPU-accelerated supercomputers will also be used as proxy machines — platforms for codesigning and developing various hardware, software and applications for FugakuNEXT. The FugakuNEXT system is planned to feature FUJITSU-MONAKA-X CPUs, which can be paired with NVIDIA technologies using NVIDIA NVLink™ Fusion, new silicon enabling high-bandwidth connections between Fujitsu’s CPUs and NVIDIA’s architecture. FugakuNEXT is expected to deliver 100x greater application performance compared with supercomputers based on CPUs or other existing systems — and will integrate production-level quantum computers in the future. By combining MONAKA-X and NVIDIA’s latest GPUs, FugakuNEXT will help shape the future of scientific discovery through innovation in HPC, AI, quantum and their combinations. This growing partnership with RIKEN reflects Japan’s commitment to innovation and NVIDIA’s support in bolstering the country’s computational infrastructure and capabilities in supercomputing and AI for science. Supercomputing Software Unlocks Scientific AdvancementsNVIDIA is already working with RIKEN to develop floating point emulation software that taps into NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU performance for accelerating traditional scientific computing. This technology will allow applications to harness the full power of GPUs for AI and HPC at RIKEN and supercomputing centers worldwide. RIKEN also plans to use NVIDIA CUDA-X™ — which provides 400+ highly optimized GPU-accelerated libraries, microservices and tools — to boost its cutting-edge HPC applications with GPU platforms, helping advance AI for science and quantum computing initiatives in Japan. The two new supercomputers will be operational in spring 2026, while FugakuNEXT is aimed for operation by 2030. About NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

November 17, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC25 -- NVIDIA today announced that the world’s leading scientific computing centers are adopting NVIDIA® NVQLink™, a first-of-its-kind, universal interconnect for linking quantum processors with state-of-the-art accelerated computing. Tapping the low-latency, high-throughput interconnect, more than a dozen supercomputing centers and national research institutions across Asia and Europe are joining U.S. facilities in advancing their ability to research, develop and harness the integration of quantum and classical hardware. “In the future, supercomputers will be quantum-GPU systems — combining the unique strengths of each: the quantum computer’s ability to simulate nature and the GPU’s programmability and massive parallelism,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVQLink with CUDA-Q is the gateway to that future — uniting quantum and GPU computing into a single, coherent system to push the frontier of what’s computable and unlocking new scientific discoveries.” By uniting quantum processors with NVIDIA accelerated computing, NVQLink’s open system architecture overcomes control and error-correction challenges and enables the development of hybrid quantum-classical applications. It delivers 40 petaflops of AI performance at FP4 precision with a GPU-QPU throughput of 400 Gb/s and a latency of less than four microseconds. NVQLink allows the coupling of quantum processors and GPUs via tight integration with quantum control systems and GPU supercomputing within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ software platform. NVQLink was designed in collaboration with quantum processor and controller builders, as well as supercomputing centers across the world, including in Asia, such as: Europe and the Middle East are also embracing quantum computing research with supercomputing and quantum technology centers supporting NVQLink, including: They join the U.S. national laboratories that recently announced integration with NVQLink technology for cutting-edge research, including: Real-World Hybrid Quantum-Classical ApplicationsQuantinuum recently announced that its latest Helios QPU, and future generations of its quantum processors, will be integrated with NVIDIA GPUs through NVQLink and will draw on the power of NVIDIA CUDA-Q to orchestrate quantum error correction. NVQLink and CUDA-Q allowed the deployment of quantum error-correction techniques to successfully protect the delicate quantum information within the Helios QPU from noise, or unwanted disturbances that cause errors in quantum systems. This demonstration is the world’s first real-time use of a scalable decoder for a class of quantum error-correction codes known as qLDPC codes. The Quantinuum team demonstrated active error correction and decoding with a decoder implementation that achieved a reaction time of 67 microseconds, exceeding Helios’ two-millisecond requirement by 32x. Key to achieving this result was NVQLink’s ability to provide a flexible and configurable decoder capable of massive parallelism. The microsecond latencies and extremely high throughput provided by NVQLink are made accessible to developers through real-time application programming interfaces in NVIDIA CUDA-Q. This lets scientists and developers easily build and test approaches to quantum error correction and quantum-GPU applications within a single programming environment. In addition, NVQLink’s use of Ethernet allows researchers to easily scale the classical compute they draw on as quantum processors and applications expand.
