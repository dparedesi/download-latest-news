Title: NVIDIA Invests $5B in Intel to Co-Develop AI and PC Chips
URL: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/news/nvidia-invests-5b-in-intel-to-codevelop-ai-and-pc-chips
Time Published: 2025-09-18T00:00:00Z

September 18, 2025 — In a landmark move for the tech industry, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced a multi-year collaboration to co-develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products that blend their respective strengths in GPUs and CPUs. At the heart of this collaboration is NVIDIA NVLink, which will tightly connect NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing platforms with Intel’s x86 CPU ecosystem. The goal: to deliver cutting-edge solutions for data centers, enterprises, and consumers. Intel will design and manufacture NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs, which NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms. These processors will be optimized for hyperscale data centers and enterprise-grade AI workloads. On the consumer side, Intel plans to launch x86 system-on-chips (SoCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These RTX SoCs are designed to power a wide range of PCs, offering world-class CPU-GPU integration to handle modern workloads from gaming to AI-powered productivity. As part of the collaboration, NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. This deal remains subject to standard regulatory approvals. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO, highlighted the significance: AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture. This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing. Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO, emphasized the shared vision: Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future. Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business. This partnership signals a reshaping of the semiconductor industry landscape, as rivals-turned-partners align to meet surging AI demand. For developers, enterprises, and end-users, it promises more tightly integrated hardware that can handle the growing complexity of AI-driven applications. ©2025 C# Corner.

Full Content:
Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year. Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for. Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month. While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking. It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring. Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value. When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201). Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201). The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Title: AI’s Next Dividend Bonanza Is NOT Where You Think

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. While Wall Street chases NVIDIA (NVDA), the real AI dividend story is unfolding in the sleepy insurance sector. These “boring” firms are quietly leveraging AI tools to slash costs, grow premiums, and—best of all—dish us bigger dividends. AI is spreading across the economy much faster than many expected. That means we need to move even faster to front-run that shift. We’ve already been hard at it. In July, we talked about our favorite dividend payer to grab as AI reworks farming. Few people realize it, but “ag” has a long history of leveraging tech. It’s a big reason why productivity per farm worker has shot up 16X since 1948. Then there’s small business—and our favorite 8.8%-paying business development company (BDC), which funds many of these “mom-and-pop” shops. You don’t hear much about it, but small biz is wildly optimistic as AI helps it solve one of its toughest challenges: finding skilled workers. So where to next? When most people think about AI in business, they think about annoying customer-service chatbots. But that’s just the public side, and only a small part of the story. The real AI “juice”—especially for insurers—is on the back end. Picture an AI app pulling data from a patient’s medical records, zipping through the underwriting process and delivering a quote in seconds. While that’s going on, another runs compliance checks. Claims? Send in a picture of your damaged car/house/business and your payout pops into your account in minutes. Absolute gold for customer retention. All of this is happening in insurance right now. And that’s just on the efficiency side. The growth story is where things get interesting, as salespeople use AI to zero in on leads and cross-sell products. One example, cited in a July 2025 report from research firm McKinsey & Co., is that an AI app could assess a new life-insurance customer and toss out a personalized package, including disability and critical-illness coverage. As I said, initiatives like these are driving real returns for insurers today. And according to a January 2024 report from McKinsey, insurers that prioritize tech, including AI, have delivered far bigger total shareholder returns (TSR) than firms in other sectors. The best part of all for us is that the public still sees insurers as stuffy pencil-pushers (the same type of outdated view that hovers over agriculture). Let’s dive into three insurers leading the way in AI, and likely to hand their savings (and profit growth) to us in the form of dividend hikes. They all have appeal, but to make things simple, I’ve ranked them from “worst to first.” Progressive (PGR) was already a leader in algo-driven insurance before AI came along. Through fictional salesperson “Flo,” it could deliver a competitive insurance quote for a car, home or even a boat in a few minutes. Fast-forward to today and Flo is, you guessed it, a chatbot. Looking a bit deeper, the company is using AI to further refine Snapshot—its program that adapts rates based on real-time data from a customer’s car. It’s also using the tech to analyze photos of damage to speed up claims. Members of my Hidden Yields service will remember this one: We bagged an 87% return on it during our last holding period, from June 2019 to May 2023. PGR remains on my watch list, and we won’t hesitate to jump back into this savvy dividend payer (whose 0.16% yield masks the fact that it pays most of its dividend as a year-end special payout—often a big one). But with the stock trading around 4.4-times book value, that time is not now. We’d also like to see more buybacks: PGR’s share count is about where it was 10 years ago. The Travelers Cos. (TRV) is a giant in insurance, offering everything from property to personal and business coverage. On the claims side, Travelers, like Progressive, uses AI to analyze images of property damage and speed payments to policyholders, often before a human ever sets foot on the site. That kind of speed gives TRV a much better shot at keeping customers happy—and hanging on to their business. On the growth side, the company has tools like Business Owner Policy 2.0, which speeds up underwriting, getting a quote into a new small business customer much faster than in “analog” days. According to the company, the process cuts the number of questions a potential new business client has to answer by 70%, from around 40 to roughly nine. Moves like these are rocket fuel for a business that’s already firing on all cylinders. In the second quarter, TRV saw its catastrophe losses drop from $1.5 billion a year ago to $927 million. Written premiums jumped 4% and net investment income jumped 6%. That last number is particularly impressive since an insurer’s “float”—made up of total premiums collected—has to be placed in safer investments. Management loves its shareholders, too: Over the last decade, Travelers bought back 26% of its shares and hiked its payout 80%. That’s driven the share price up a stout 170%. With reinvested dividends, that return jumps to 237%! The only drawback? We like to buy a stock when the share price lags its “Dividend Magnet”—a true sign of value—and that’s not the case here. That’s why we’re putting this “stealth” AI dividend play on our watch list, instead of our buy list. Meantime, the AI focus at American International Group (AIG) is solidly on underwriting. The company has teamed up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Anthropic to develop AI tools that supercharge its human underwriters. Through these deals, it aims to help its underwriters process 500,000 E&S submissions in 2030, generating at least $4 billion in new business premiums. (E&S covers risks that don’t fit neatly in the silos of other kinds of coverage.) To put that in context, AIG generates about $28 billion in revenue a year. AIG also plans to create a “digital twin,” kind of a virtual mock-up of itself management can use to see what various decisions could have on the business. It’s on the dividend front that AIG gets really interesting. It yields 2.3% today and, following a long, stale period stretching back to 2016, it has recently sprung back to life. Management hasn’t been leaving investors out in the cold, though—it’s been busy buying back its ultra-cheap stock. That includes a massive repurchase of 56% of its shares outstanding in the last decade. Better still, it’s been accelerating those payouts just as it’s reawakened its dividend: Normally we don’t like to see a company buy more of its stock as it’s rising, as is the case here. But AIG’s reasonable valuation of around book value is backed up by its share price, which still lags the dividend. An AI-powered efficiency boost would only add to the stock’s momentum.

Title: China Bans Top Tech Firms From Buying Nvidia Chips, Report Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/china-bans-top-tech-firms-from-buying-nvidia-chips-report-says-11811683
Time Published: 2025-09-17T15:13:01Z

China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country. Shares of Nvidia, which entered Wednesday's session up roughly a third this year, fell about 3% in recent trading following the news. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D—the chip Nvidia introduced in July for the Chinese market, according to the Financial Times. Beijing had concluded that homegrown chips are now performing on par with the Nvidia chips allowed in China under export controls, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. The FT report said the companies that started testing and verification work on the chip with Nvidia's server suppliers have since told their suppliers to stop the work. The new ban is stronger than prior guidance from regulators that focused on curbing use of the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip, and comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Asked at a press conference in London about the reported ban, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was "disappointed." Huang is among U.S. tech executives accompanying President Donald Trump on a state visit to the U.K. "We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said, according to a transcript provided to Investopedia by the company. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese [government] and Chinese companies as they wish.” Nvidia faces U.S. export restrictions on sales of its most advanced chips to China and has tailor-made some of its semiconductors for the country's market. In August, Trump ended H20 restrictions his administration had placed earlier earlier in the year in exchange for a 15% share of revenues.

Stock futures are little changed as investors get ready for today’s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to lower rates for the first time this year; China has reportedly ordered firms to stop buying the latest Nvidia (NVDA) chip designed for that market; Meta Platforms (META) is expected to highlight its AI glasses at its developer event; and StubHub shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are little changed ahead of today’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit fresh all-time highs yesterday morning before finishing the day slightly lower, were down less than 0.1% this morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked lower to 4.01%, near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were down slightly at around $3,700 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin edged lower to $116,300. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates today, with the announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET today. While most investors believe the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, some are betting that a half-point cut is possible amid signs of weakness in the labor market. The Fed will also release its quarterly projections on the direction of the economy and interest rates. At 2:30 p.m. ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss the decision and speak on general economic conditions. Investors will be looking for signals that the Fed believes economic conditions warrant more rate cuts in the coming months. China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading. Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's "Hypernova" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday. StubHub has raised $800 million from its initial public offering after pricing the deal at the midpoint of a marketed range, as the online ticketing reseller succeeds in its third attempt at going public. StubHub sold 34 million shares for $23.50 each, which values the online ticket reseller at around $8.8 billion. The stock is expected to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “STUB”. The IPO comes after StubHub delayed its own listing plans earlier this year amid market turmoil following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. StubHub’s listing follows similar public offerings in recent weeks, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna’s IPO last week.

US stock market experienced a modest pullback on Tuesday as investors balanced optimism from strong consumer spending against uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated policy meeting. Despite the slight declines in major indexes, economic data revealed robust retail sales in August, rising 0.6%, well above expectations. This indicates that American consumers remain resilient even as inflation persists and the labor market shows signs of softening.

Title: 3 High Yield Dividends To Buy As Stocks Hit All-Time Highs

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We’ve got a frankly, bizarre dynamic setting up in stocks right now. Global stocks are clobbering their American cousins this year. But here’s the disconnect: This is happening even though US stocks are hitting all-time highs seemingly every day. On the surface, it sounds like both of these can’t be true. But as we’ll see below, this setup makes total sense. We’ll also look at how we can play it for both offense—price upside, in other words—and defense (in the form of 8%+ dividends), too. Here we’re looking at the S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), in purple, compared to the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Index Fund (VEU), a good benchmark for global stocks (minus the US, as the name says), in orange. So what’s going on here? It’s only when we zoom out that things clear up: Over the long run, America’s lead is unquestionable—and it puts this year’s “blip” in much better context. This is why, if you subscribe to my CEF Insider service, you know I remain bullish on US stocks, particularly the high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold them. That’s because at CEF Insider we focus on dividends (often in the 8%+ range) and we think long-term. And while US stocks might trail for short periods, betting against America over the long term is always a mistake. But I do understand that more Americans are interested in buying international stocks. We can see that in the run they’ve put on this year: It quite simply wouldn’t have happened without Americans climbing aboard the global bandwagon. (America does, after all, have the highest percentage of stock investors in the world, at 55% of the population, going by the latest numbers from Visual Capitalist.) And holding at least some international stocks is just plain smart, especially if we see another April-style pullback in US markets. Beyond that, many international stocks pay higher dividends than US firms. Even looking across the northern border nets a considerably higher dividend yield, with index funds tracking major Canadian stocks yielding 2.6%, more than double the S&P 500’s 1.2%. But that’s still just 2.6%! Not nearly enough to fund a retirement on. VEU pays roughly the same. Then there’s VEU’s long-term underperformance, which I talked about a second ago. The main problem with VEU is that it’s simply too diversified. With its passive approach to owning just about everything abroad, it holds a lot of questionable companies in questionable countries. This is why actively managed funds (like the three 8%+ payers we’ll discuss below) have outperformed it in many cases. For instance, Tencent Holdings is one of VEU’s biggest positions, and the Chinese government has warned stock prices have gotten too high in the mainland as of late. That’s raised the possibility of new rules to limit stock speculation, which would hurt large stocks like Tencent. That’s why we want active management—especially in international stocks. That way we ensure we’re avoiding not just poor-quality companies but also those that operate in less-stable nations, where the rule of law may not be as strong as it is in places like North America and Europe. The three CEFs we’re going to discuss next give us that. Plus they’ve all beaten VEU (in green in the chart below) over the long term. And they’ve done so during a time when foreign assets were less popular among US investors. That sets them up for stronger gains now that more Americans are thinking globally. Let’s dive into them. The Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) gives us stock-like upside with convertible bonds acting as “ballast.” I say that because convertibles provide high, steady income, even in volatile markets. The result is a dividend that shows up every month and yields 8.1% on an annualized basis. With CHW, we’re effectively buying cash flow and the option to pivot between income-producing bonds and stocks, with both on sale; its largest positions—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and a Boeing (BA) 6% convertible preferred bond—let us tap surging AI growth, while the convertible bond dampens pullbacks with its steadier price and payouts. And because the fund’s mandate spans the world, management can shift with volatility. This flexibility has also helped keep the fund’s dividend steady over the last three years. Next up is the LMP Capital & Income Fund (SCD), with its combination of income-producing assets and capital-gains-producing stocks. The fund pays monthly, at a 9.3% annualized rate. And it’s cheap, too, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). SCD’s biggest positions consist of both tech darlings and utilities, with names like Marvell Technology (MRVL), Oracle (ORCL) and PPL Corp. (PPL) pairing growth and reliability. The result is a steady, diversified cash machine that can lean toward offense or defense without putting the dividend at risk. Finally, let’s talk about a less-obvious investment I like because it combines American blue chips and top foreign firms. The Virtus NFJ Dividend Value Fund (NFJ) captures income from foreign demand while blending in US firms, with their reliable regulations. It also generates extra income using a covered-call strategy that generates more income when global tensions rise. NFJ owns dividend payers and convertibles, sells call options and hands us a 9.3% dividend while trading at a steep 9.5% discount. The fund also uses zero leverage—a nice extra margin of safety should interest rates unexpectedly rise. With a portfolio dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL), AMD (AMD) and Prologis (PLD), this fund combines American giants with large margins and reliable cash flows with exposure to foreign demand (about half of Alphabet’s revenue comes from abroad, and about a quarter for AMD). Now, I’ve been saving the best part, and it’s this chart. SCD’s discount (in orange above) recently exploded to a premium before fading to its 6.7% discount. CHW’s 10.8% discount (in purple) has broken through the 10% mark a few times lately, and NFJ’s 9.3% discount (in blue) has narrowed quite a bit. On the whole, this tells us that more investors are noticing these funds, setting up their discounts to shrink further, putting a lift under their share prices as they do.

Title: AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
