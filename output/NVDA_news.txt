Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. Your email address will not be published.

Title: 10 Datapoints for Thanksgiving

Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:14Z

November 26, 2025 2:00pm by Barry Ritholtz It’s that time of year again when families gather to feast on bountiful harvests and to give thanks for all of our blessings. This year, skip the “Vibes” and instead focus on market data. Don’t lose sight of nuances and shades of grey; they don’t make for great memes, but they do lead to a better understanding of what’s going on. Here are ten nuanced, slightly contrarian ideas for you to chew over: 1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market higher for years to come. Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time. My favorite takes on AI have come from Derek Thompson and Timothy Lee, who looked into the 12 main arguments Pro & Con, and Benjamin Riley, who aims to “help people understand human cognition and artificial intelligence.” 2. INFLATION: Everything costs more this year — except for the Turkey. The largest fiscal stimulus since World War 2 led to the largest inflation surge since the 1970s. The rate of price increases rose by 9% (peaking June 2022) before falling back to 3% nearly as quickly. There were numerous causes of inflation, but the top of the list was the pandemic supply issues and the huge fiscal stimulus. People confuse the rate of price change with prices. We had high inflation; today, we have low(ish) inflation, but we still retain higher prices. Everything is much more expensive today, even with inflation way down. Low Inflation and High Prices are not mutually exclusive. CPI Inflation is in the 2-3% range today, but it is ticking upwards, creating difficulties for those on the FOMC who want to cut rates. 3. SUPPLY & DEMAND: We may not have structural inflation as we did in the 1970s, but we do have a structural imbalance in supply and demand of many critical goods and services. A few significant examples: Until supply catches up with demand, those prices will remain high. And that is before we get to health care and education costs. 4. ENERGY: The inflation of the 1970s was structural, caused in large part by the Arab Oil Embargo. In contrast, the United States is a net energy exporter today. In the 1970s, energy accounted for about 10% of the average household budget; the Chicago Fed found it peaked at nearly 14% in the early 1980s. Household energy costs are about half of those levels today (5-6%), even as energy consumption has increased significantly. Every power-hungry device, from automobiles to HVAC systems to appliances, is now many times more efficient than in the past. The wildcard is increased demand from power-hungry data centers… 5. CRYPTO CRASH: Given the embrace of crypto by the President (and POTUS’s family), much of Bitcoin 2025 gains can be attributed to this administration’s policies. We should not be surprised by the correlation between the President’s political fortunes / approval ratings, and the price of Bitcoin. The President has had a terrible month; from the election thumping to the fallout with MTG to losing multiple legal cases (Tariffs at SCOTUS, Comey / James case dismissals), it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has suffered a 30% crash this month as well: 6. TARIFFS: Are fascinating: They cause temporary inflation spikes and permanent higher prices. There is no getting around it – any additional tax on imported goods is a source of increased prices. And as we have seen before, even domestic producers will raise prices (Greedflation) if they believe consumers won’t balk. The good news: If the Supreme Court arguments were anything to go on, many of the Tariffs are likely to get struck down. 7. RATE CUTS: You can make a solid case either way – inflation remains stubborn at (or over) 3%, but there are signs of labor market softness, slowing consumer sales, and mediocre sentiment. Expectations had fallen to a ~20% chance of a rate cut – until yesterday’s poor data. Now, we are back to an 80% chance of a December cut. Beyond that is anyone’s guess… 8. BUBBLES: By definition, it takes a crowd to create a bubble. Can you recall the public, the media, or even the Fed identifying a bubble on a timely basis? (Me neither). Asked differently, can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational? If your answer is yes, then it’s likely not a bubble. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the AI bubble debate is Alphabet (GOOGL) passing Nvidia (NVDA) YTD returns: : 9. RECESSION: People hate inflation, but the alternative was a deep and long-lasting pandemic recession. We avoided a 10-12% unemployment rate, but the cost was 9% inflation. Consider the alternative, had both the Trump and Biden admins not cranked up the fiscal spend, people would have been furious at the failure to do anything1. It’s a Lose/Lose; whatever choice got made, half the population would have been furious. As angry as people are over high prices, they would have been even angrier at a do-nothing government letting an ugly recession take hold. 10. VALUATIONS: The Mag 7 remains pricey, even as Nvidia slides 13% off its highs. Its expensive, but it also generates $57 billion in quarterly revenues! Some sectors are extremely overpriced, others are more reasonable. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — is at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, but not ridiculous. Nuance is your friend. Safe travels!

Several top AI chipmakers lost ground as a potential deal between two Big Tech giants underscored competitive pressures in the market. Meanwhile, shares of an electronics retailer moved higher after a strong quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes rose for the third straight session as investors grew increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its December meeting. The Dow rose 1.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.9%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.7% higher. See here for more from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) shares jumped 10% to log Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of electronic test and measurement solutions topped quarterly earnings estimates. The company's sales outlook came in ahead of expectations, boosted by strong demand from AI data centers. Keysight also announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Shares of companies exposed to the housing market extended their recent rise amid growing optimism about a cut in interest rates, which would lead to lower mortgage rates. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) stock surged close to 9% Tuesday, adding to solid gains posted by the residential construction materials supplier in the prior session. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected same-store sales, revenue, and adjusted profit for the third quarter, and its shares powered over 5% higher. The company also raised its full-year outlook, pointing to consumer resilience as well as gains in the computer, tablet, and gaming categories as customers upgrade and replace older devices. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped nearly 3% following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is evaluating using AI chips from Google. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed close to 2% to finish at a fresh high. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock lost 3.7% after the parent of its namesake fruit spreads, Jif peanut butter, and Folgers coffee released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Although sales for the period edged out forecasts and adjusted profit matched expectations, Smucker's full-year profit outlook disappointed. The company has raised its coffee prices as it navigates tariff pressures but said it would refrain from additional price hikes this winter after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained Tuesday afternoon, extending Monday's rally to start a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked 0.1% higher. Kohl's (KSS) saw its shares surge 35% after the department store chain reported a surprise third-quarter profit. The results came a day after the retailer said it would remove the "interim" tag from CEO Michael Bender's title to take over the top job permanently after its prior CEO lasted just months before being ousted over allegations of improper dealings with a vendor. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) was another retailer that soared Tuesday, with shares up 30% after the company topped third-quarter earnings estimates. Sales growth has slowed among its namesake brand, but picked up for Hollister, which executives said is expected to carry the company's sales for the holiday season. Videoconference software maker Zoom Communications (ZM) also posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares 12% higher. The company said it is seeing meaningful adoption of its AI offerings. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank close to 4%, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 Tuesday following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using chips from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares of Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chipmakers also slid. Coinbase (COIN) stock was one of several connected to the cryptocurrency sector, along with Robinhood (HOOD), Mara Holdings (MARA), and Strategy (MSTR), that extended their recent declines as the price of Bitcoin lost ground, trading around $87,200. The price of gold rose, and crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 4.00%. The U.S. dollar lost ground against the pound, yen, and euro.

Buy now or regret it? Rumors of price hikes are mounting up… When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you're thinking about buying a graphics card, there have been further whispers from the grapevine that price hikes could be coming due to the spiking cost of video memory – meaning Black Friday may be the best chance to get a good deal on a new GPU for some time. TechPowerUp highlighted (via VideoCardz) that analyst Dan Nystedt on X flagged a (paywalled) report from UDN, which claims AMD has told its graphics card-making partners that prices are set to rise. AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025 The article suggests that AMD is hiking prices by 10% across its entire Radeon product line due to the rising cost of video RAM (VRAM) modules. Obviously, take that with a whole heap of seasoning, but we have seen multiple reports in recent times about the rising cost of memory – for RAM chips and storage alike – being a very real phenomenon. So, it seems like the situation is worsening for graphics cards when it comes to VRAM, at least on AMD's side. GPUs use VRAM to speed up their performance – it's much quicker than relying on the PC's system memory, as VRAM is right there, on the board, and swift to access – and some graphics cards pile a lot of the stuff on. When AMD sells graphics chips to a board-making partner, the practice is to bundle the video RAM modules with it – these are the two main components in a graphics card, of course. With the cost of RAM increasing by a considerable amount, the price of those bundles is increasing, with AMD charging its partners more. Of course, that cost won't be absorbed by the card maker, but will be passed on to the consumer who's buying the product. Therefore, Radeon GPUs are likely to get around 10% pricier on the shelves as the impact of this filters through the supply and production chain, but obviously, as noted, we need to be careful around rumors and a single report – it might be untrue. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That said, given a lot of recent speculation about how GPU prices might rise, the evidence is mounting, and there's an increasing feeling that if you do want to buy a graphics card in the near – or even middle-term – future, Black Friday could offer the best prices for quite some time. (There's a tempting Sapphire RX 9060 XT deal on the boil for one thing). And if you're thinking that price hikes might apply more to high-end graphics cards with lots of VRAM, think again – this will hit more affordable GPUs just as much. Indeed, there's even been a suggestion that some cheaper (mid-range) graphics cards are going to be canned, as those models that pack more VRAM relative to their price bracket (principally more affordable 16GB offerings) are set for disproportionate cost increases – hikes that may not make much sense for the product. I'd take that with even more seasoning, and the same holds true for the rumors about Nvidia delaying RTX 5000 Super refreshes due to VRAM supply issues. But still, all this very much adds to the general vibe of buying now rather than waiting, which is currently gripping the GPU market. ➡️ Read our full guide to the best graphics card1.

Share this article Alphabet stock (GOOG) surged around 4% in premarket trading on Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped 3% following a report that Meta may tap Google’s AI hardware. According to The Information, Mark Zuckerberg’s company is exploring a multiyear purchase of Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) in a bid to diversify its AI hardware supply and reduce its reliance on Nvidia. The talks reportedly include renting TPUs as early as next year and deploying them more broadly by 2027. The news pushed Alphabet shares higher overnight, extending Monday’s 6% rally. According to Yahoo Finance, the stock reached a fresh all-time high and is on track to reach $4 trillion in market capitalization. Alphabet’s performance has been strong throughout the month, with shares up around 22%, boosted in part by Berkshire Hathaway’s investment. Warren Buffett’s company acquired 17.8 million Alphabet shares, worth approximately $4.3 billion, in the third quarter of 2025, its first major move into a leading Big Tech name.
