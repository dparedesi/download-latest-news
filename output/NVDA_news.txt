Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

Title: Nvidia Rides the AI Wave to Become the World’s First $4 Trillion Company

When the stock markets opened this morning, Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first publicly traded company to reach a market value of $4 trillion, surpassing tech industry giants Apple and Microsoft in reaching the record-setting benchmark. While Nvidia’s market cap has since dipped to $3.99 trillion as of writing, it is nonetheless an incredible achievement to be the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark. Nvidia’s extraordinary financial success is due in significant part to the company’s commitment to making chips for the AI arms race, a move that helped it reach a $2 trillion valuation — the highest-ever at the time for a chipmaker — not even a year and a half ago. In the past five years, Nvidia’s stock price has gone from less than $11 per share to over $163 today. Save for a sizable tumble in April this year, which the company has obviously since recovered from, it has been nearly exclusively good news for the American multinational corporation during the AI era. Nvidia’s revenue eclipsed $130.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 114% increase year-over-year, and way above the company’s $26.97 billion revenue in 2023. Nvidia’s rise has been meteoric. Meanwhile, Microsoft, which boasts an impressive $3.75 trillion market cap, has experienced tremendous growth of its own over the past five years. Microsoft’s stock price has risen 290 points, or 136%, in five years. In contrast to many of its peers, Microsoft has also had an excellent 2025 so far, with stock prices rising 20.5% since January 1. However, Microsoft recently laid off about 15,000 employees as part of its AI-focused restructuring in the past two months, so while investors may be loving Microsoft, all is not well at the Redmond-based company. Another company that was a strong contender to hit the $4 trillion market cap mark first, Apple, has experienced a very different 2025 than Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple’s stock price has dropped 35 points (14.3%) so far this year and is about 50 points off its peak from last December. On December 27, 2024, Apple came close to $4 trillion — hitting $3.86 trillion. From hitting $1 trillion market cap in May 2023 to topping $4 trillion, if only briefly, on July 9, 2025, Nvidia has benefited from the AI hype more than any other company on Earth. “This is a historical moment for Nvidia, the tech space flexing its muscles, and speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of growth led by the one chip fueling AI… Nvidia,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN over email today. Ives also told CNN that he expects Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion mark sometime this summer. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the company is still in the early stages of AI’s financial and technological potential. He said on an earnings call in May that every country and industry on Earth will need AI. Huang may be right, as the financial markets love AI, even if society at large doesn’t.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.

Title: Buy This Alternative To Nvidia Stock For 2x Gains?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 11: In this photo illustration, the logo of Applied Materials, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's stock market chart visible in the background, on May 11, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Is it possible for Applied Materials stock (NASDAQ:AMAT) to reach close to $380 in the coming years? There is a strong likelihood, as the company is poised to benefit from the rising capital expenditures driven by the generative artificial intelligence boom. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) captures headlines with its stock having increased over 3x in the past two years and its valuation nearing $4 trillion, lesser-known players like Applied are essential for producing the very AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks could present more value and significant upside potential. The data presents a compelling case. According to SEMI, capital spending on advanced chip manufacturing equipment is expected to nearly double between 2023 and 2028, with global capex expenditures anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Applied, which specializes in advanced equipment and software utilized to manufacture semiconductor chips—ranging from etchers and deposition systems to process control software—may be well situated to capture a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s clientele includes industry giants such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, positioning it as a central player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Applied Materials has seen its revenues increase at a robust pace, with an annual growth rate of 13% over the last five years. Although the company is expected to experience a slowdown in sales growth to about 6% for FY'25, reaching $29 billion, growth could accelerate. If Applied manages to grow its sales at an average annual rate of nearly 22% over the next three years—driven by increased demand for advanced tools for producing memory and logic chips for AI—its revenues could rise from approximately $29 billion in FY'25 to about $53 billion by FY'28, representing an increase of roughly 81%. Several trends may facilitate revenue growth in the upcoming years. The generative artificial intelligence (AI) surge is fueling a sharp increase in semiconductor demand. AI workloads necessitate substantial computational power, greater memory capacity, and more intricate chips, all of which require advanced manufacturing processes. Additionally, AI demands high-bandwidth memory and sophisticated chip packaging—areas where Applied Materials excels. For instance, producing HBM chips is three times as wafer-intensive as standard DRAM, owing to lower bit density and the necessity for 3D stacking. This directly results in higher demand for products manufactured by companies like Applied. While Applied’s considerable exposure to China, which made up over a third of its revenue in FY'24, has raised investor concerns due to U.S. export restrictions, signs of easing tensions are emerging. Recently, the U.S. and China reached a trade agreement that includes rare earth exports. As part of this accord, the Trump administration relaxed recent export license requirements for certain chip design software sold to China. If this thawing of tensions continues and extends to semiconductor equipment exports, firms like Applied could gain improved access to an essential growth market. Applied Materials has performed well in recent years, climbing from approximately $85 in early 2021 to around $190 currently. However, the increase in AMAT stock over the past four years has not been consistent, as annual returns have exhibited much greater volatility compared to the S&P 500. The stock's returns were 84% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023, followed by 9% in 2024 and 17% year-to-date so far in 2025. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has proven to be significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year in that timeframe. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; offering fewer wild fluctuations as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. When we combine this substantial revenue growth with the fact that Applied's adjusted net margins (net income, or profits remaining after all expenses and taxes, represented as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trajectory—growing from 19.6% in FY'19 to 26.5% in FY'24—we see that the company has benefitted from improved economies of scale and a more premium product mix. We anticipate that margins could continue to rise to approximately 31% by FY'28 as Applied concentrates on new technologies such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) semiconductor equipment, while also effectively managing its costs. Applied is experiencing faster growth in its services sales compared to products, which could furthermore enhance margins since services contracts typically yield recurring revenues and are increasingly focused on more lucrative software. Additionally, Applied has demonstrated considerable discipline in its capital expenditures as compared to other competitors in the chip sector, which could also contribute to higher margins. The combination of approximately 81% revenue growth with about a 20% increase in margins suggests an estimated 2.2x growth in earnings over the subsequent three years. If earnings do in fact grow by 2.2x, the P/E multiple would contract by 2.2x, assuming the stock price remains constant. However, this is precisely what investors in Applied Materials are wagering will not be the case. If earnings increase by 2.2x in the next few years, instead of the price to earnings multiple compressing from around 20x now to approximately 10x, a scenario where the P/E ratio stabilizes around 18x appears quite plausible, as the robust growth and expanding margins instill greater confidence in the future of Applied Materials.This would result in a potential doubling of Applied stock price from $190 to roughly $380 within the next few years, making it a realistic scenario.What is the time frame for this high-return possibility? While our example above illustrates a timeframe of roughly three years, in practice, whether it takes three years or four may not significantly differ; as long as Applied is on this revenue expansion path, with margins remaining stable, the stock price could respond accordingly. While there may be upside potential for AMAT stock, there are inherent risks associated with investing in individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has exceeded its all-cap stocks benchmark (which combines the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What is the reason for this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach, allowing optimal capitalizing on thriving market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Any dip in Nvidia stock is most likely a buying opportunity. This article isn’t about Nvidia’s parabolic rise amid the AI boom. It won’t dwell on the well-known fact that Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 90% of AI data centers worldwide or that tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta remain deeply invested in its silicon innovations. It’s not even about CUDA, Nvidia’s giant competitive moat that is still relevant today. Nor will we focus on how the stock struggled earlier this year, as investors kept raising the bar, until even spectacular results weren’t good enough. And yet, Nvidia has not only reclaimed its top spot, it is trading at record highs. The trillion-dollar question now is: Can Nvidia stock reach $200 by year-end? Or is that a stretch even for a strong compounder like the AI bellwether? On June 25, 2025, Nvidia surged over 4%, closing at a record $154.31, reclaiming its spot as the most valuable publicly traded company (~$3.77 trillion market cap), surpassing Microsoft and Apple. The stock is even higher now, and the last closing price is $159.34, marking a stellar comeback, from Nvidia’s April 4th closing low of $94.30. Nvidia stock erased more than 40% of its value between February and April of this year, not because of any failing on its part. Concerns over moderating AI spending, and unpredictable tariff policies triggered the decline. This is not Nvidia’s first rodeo either. Prior to that, DeepSeek revelations in late January created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day. The market was simply recalibrating its perception of perfection. While DeepSeek showed promise, it is nowhere in the leagues of an established AI leader like Nvidia. So, the sell-off was unjustified in my opinion. The Nvidia stock bounced back within a month. Last year too, Nvidia shares fell nearly 23% from mid-July through early August, closing August 7th trade at $98.88. The sell-off was triggered by fears that Nvidia’s big tech customers may trim their AI spending budgets. However, Nvidia stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at nearly $130. Every time a quality stock drops, the internet floods with "Should you buy the dip?" takes. My view is simple: Study the cause. If the sell-off happened for reasons that can be fixed – go ahead and buy. But if it stems from deeper, structural weaknesses, then walk away. It’s not like there’s only one good stock out there. Nvidia’s deeply integrated AI ecosystem gives it a wide berth over competition, and its innovation remains unsurpassed. Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. That said, investor perception is everything when it comes to stock pricing. The recent rally has given reason to hope that the market may be finally waking up to the true value of this stock following a period of inflated expectations and sharp corrections.The fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to keep the buying pressure active and drive NVDA to at least $180 by the end of this year. Of course, I could be wrong. China is a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened dramatically from 95% before 2022, to 50% currently, after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. To comply with the U.S. export curbs, Nvidia has been selling H20 to China. H20 is a watered-down version of its H100 chips with significantly lower computing power. However, in April, the U.S. government tightened restrictions again, reclassifying even the scaled-down H20 as requiring an export license. The decision effectively halted shipments and dealt Nvidia a serious financial blow. CEO Jensen Huang put it bluntly: “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.” Calling the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market “effectively closed to the U.S. industry,” Huang also warned that if U.S. export restrictions continue, more Chinese customers will turn to Huawei's chips. I highlighted this risk in a previous article that flagged both the threat of an H20 ban and Huawei’s preparation for competitive positioning, citing Jefferies and WSJ reports. Nvidia recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue prior to April 9, before the new export restrictions kicked in. The financial fallout from the ban was significant. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in unsold H20 inventory for the first quarter, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of what would have been H20-generated revenue. Gross margin fell to 61%, versus the 71.3% it would have reported without the China-related charges. In an interview with the Stratechery podcast in May, Huang also revealed the company had to walk away from an additional $15 billion of sales. The topline guidance of $45 billion for the July quarter, would have been higher by $8 billion, but for the new export restrictions. So, why is there still hope for a China rebound for Nvidia? Nvidia is pivoting swiftly. A Reuters report citing sources familiar to the matter said Nvidia is planning to build a GPU or graphics processing unit for China based on its latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors that will be priced at $6,500-8,000, well below the H20’s price range of $10,000-$12,000. The lower price could reflect the new export limits on GPU memory bandwidth – a metric crucial for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Also, recent developments suggest a thaw in the U.S.’s formerly hardline stance against China, signaling a broader shift in tone This gives rise to a key question: In this more conciliatory phase, is there any possibility that the U.S. could revisit its chip export restrictions to China as well? The New York Times reported on June 27th that China confirmed details of a trade framework with the Trump administration. “China will review and approve applications for the export of controlled items,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, and “the United States will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures it has taken against China.” While specifics remain vague, the framework hints at a meaningful de-escalation. The most compelling driver behind this shift? Not a change of heart, just China’s dominance in rare earth elements – critical for semiconductors, robotics and aerospace applications. This accord between the U.S. and China, includes the latter’s commitment to deliver rare earth, in exchange for the U.S. lifting its export curbs on ethane, chip software and jet engines. As trade talks evolve, Beijing is not above deploying its rare earth “Trump card” to reopen access to restricted U.S. AI chip technologies. If the U.S. should revise or relax chip export policies or greenlight a new line of compliant processors, Nvidia could regain access to the highly lucrative market. Such a development would materially bolster the case for Nvidia hitting $200 by year’s end. However, even without China, Nvidia remains on solid footing, thanks to its ability to innovate relentlessly. Nvidia’s growth story is deeply structural, spanning beyond GPUs to hyperscaler ramp-ups, AI factories, sovereign AI, Networking, gaming, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. Nvidia isn’t just firing on all cylinders – it is building entirely new growth engines. Blackwell’s Blockbuster Ramp: In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia’s data center revenue surged 73% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $39 billion, with compute revenue accounting for $34.2 billion, up 76% y-o-y. At the heart of this explosive growth lies Blackwell, the fastest-ramping architecture in Nvidia’s history. AI Factories and Sovereign AI: As nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack, Sovereign AI is a solid growth engine for the AI bellwether. Nvidia has sovereign AI deals in place with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. AI factory build-outs are driving significant revenue for Nvidia with deployments at AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek and Telenor. The count of Nvidia-powered AI factories doubled y-o-y to roughly 100 in the first quarter, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. Nvidia’s new Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics switches will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs. These switches offer 3.5x greater power efficiency, 10x higher network resiliency and accelerate customer time-to-market by 1.3x. Other revenue drivers: This brings us to networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia with first-quarter networking revenue reaching nearly $5 billion, up 56% y-o-y and 64% sequentially. Networking growth was driven by NVLink, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. Also helping networking growth is the continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions. Spectrum X – which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI – is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue with deployments across Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Meta, Google Cloud and xAI. For AI-powered cybersecurity – Checkpoint, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA’s AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows. CrowdStrike, for instance, has achieved 2x faster detection triage with 50% fewer compute resources. Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record $3.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of the Blackwell architecture. Professional Visualization revenue, which includes Nvidia Omniverse, rose 19% from a year ago to $509 million, thanks to broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation. Automotive and Robotics revenue rose 72% to $567 million from a year ago, driven by sales of Nvidia’s self-driving platforms. Most recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company’s next biggest growth opportunity after AI, noting that self-driving cars are likely to be the first major commercial application of this technology. Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as expensive as it is touted to be. Some valuation metrics suggest room for upside: Interestingly, those discount levels align closely with the roughly 25-30% upside Nvidia would need to reach $200. That leaves the question less about if Nvidia can reach $200 and more about when investors will be ready to price that in. So, what are analysts saying about the Nvidia stock? Nvidia currently has a “Strong Buy” rating with a 12-month price target of $174 per share. Loop Capital lifted its price target for Nvidia to $250 from $175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. The rating firm’s client note said, "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.” Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating with a $200 target, citing robust fundamentals and strong growth expectations through 2025 and especially in 2026. A few Bumps on Nvidia's road to $200 include: Bottom line In my opinion, Nvidia stock is likely to reach at least $180 by year-end, supported by a re-rating in its forward PEG to around 1.47, if market sentiment continues to remain constructive. Key catalysts will be earnings announcements for the rest of the year, but it all boils down to market perception. Nvidia can continue to generate stellar results, and if that fails to align with already-high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could pause or pull back. That said, for the long-term, Nvidia is a structural compounder with deeply embedded growth levers and robust AI tailwinds. Any dip in the stock is most likely a buying opportunity. If there is any change in China export policy, the Nvidia stock could achieve its $180 target even sooner and be well on its way to $200 by year-end.

Traders at Citi are building conviction for a “Magnificent 7” stock that they say is competing in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. The bank says that a major bump in the demand for AI infrastructure, especially sovereign governments looking to build national plants, is bullish for Nvidia (NVDA), Yahoo Finance reports. Say Citi analysts Atif Malik and Papa Syll, “We believe sovereign demand is already contributing up to billions of dollars in 2025 [and will rise more in 2026].” The analysts note that “essentially every sovereign deal” involves Nvidia, putting the company in a central position in the race for AI infrastructure. “Nvidia has line of sight to tens of gigawatts of sovereign and enterprise AI factory buildouts over the next few years.” Citi is forecasting a 5% growth in Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2027, and 11% in 2028, and has currently raised its price target for NVDA to $190, a 20% rally from current prices. In a recent interview with CNBC, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that despite the tariff war and geopolitical uncertainty, retail investors had been using the trading platform to accumulate most of the classic favorites as before, one of which was NVDA. “And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Nvidia (NVDA) is poised to take advantage of growing demand for sovereign artificial intelligence, Citi analysts wrote Monday, as governments and other organizations invest heavily in AI. The bank raised its price target for Nvidia stock to $190 from $180, lifting it further above the Visible Alpha analyst consensus of $174. Citi expects the AI data center market to reach $563 billion in 2028, up from a prior estimate of $500 billion, based on higher-than-expected sovereign AI demand. That benefits Nvidia, which is “involved in essentially every sovereign deal,” Citi said. Sovereign AI refers to artificial intelligence capabilities developed for a single entity, often a national government, run on systems under that entity's control. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month announced multiple sovereign AI partnerships during a European tour that included stops in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The semiconductor titan also recently partnered with Humain, an AI subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Bank of America analysts have said they expect “every major country” to invest in sovereign AI, “generating high-tech employment, and serving critical healthcare, defense, industrial, financial and cyber needs.” Oppenheimer said the global sovereign AI market could be $1.5 trillion, including $120 billion in Europe. Shares of Nvidia were less than 1% lower in recent trading Monday. They ended last week at a record high.

Title: One Analyst Asserts Customers Are Only Buying AMD GPUs To “Stimulate Competition And Price-Check NVIDIA,” Channel Checks Indicate “Significant” Inventory Build

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AMD has had some successes recently in reversing the negative perception around the supposed inferiority of its AI GPU offerings in relation to NVIDIA's, which continue to reign as the industry standard. However, one Wall Street analyst remains decidedly cautious on AMD's near-term prospects, recommending a wait-and-see approach for now. To wit, Truist Securities analyst William Stein has reiterated a 'Hold' rating on AMD shares, replete with a stock price target of $111 per share, which corresponds to a downside potential of around 20 percent relative to the current share price of ~$137.70. Stein alludes to the ongoing debate on whether AMD customers are only "buying to stimulate competition and price-check NVDA," or genuinely prefer AMD's technology, to declare that he prefers the former thesis. Stein also clarified AMD's recent AWS-related controversy, where the logo of Amazon's cloud business first appeared and then mysteriously disappeared from the chipmaker's list of customers. As per Stein's discussions with AMD's management, Amazon would prefer to announce a tie-up with AMD at its own events, and not via the appearance of a mere logo within AMD literature. Critically, Stein's channel checks indicate a "significant inventory build" for AMD, which is "difficult to explain," as per the analyst's admission. Given the breadth of uncertainty surrounding AMD's AI GPU business at the moment, the Truist analyst has chosen not to express a "strong view" as to whether AMD's upcoming quarterly earnings would constitute a positive or negative catalyst. As we recently noted in a dedicated post, AMD has now officially unveiled its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on its 4th-gen Instinct architecture and will become available in the third quarter of 2025. According to AMD, these GPUs are capable of delivering a 4x increase in AI compute power and a 35x increase in inferencing capacity. The company has also launched the 7th iteration of the ROCm, an open-source platform that can be used to tweak the performance of AMD's GPUs. The chipmaker claims ROCm 7 delivers an average of 3.5x and 3x performance improvement in inference and training, respectively, over its previous iteration. AMD's Helios AI rack solution, which combines MI400 GPUs with Zen-6-based Venice CPUs and Vulcano NICs, is now expected to launch in 2026. Finally, AMD has also teased the successor to Helios, which will launch in 2027 and leverage MI500 GPUs, Verano CPUs, and Vulcano NICs. The launch of MI350 GPUs in Q3 is expected to boost AMD's top-line metric for the second half of the year, with Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, C.J. Muse, now expecting AMD to earn around $6 billion in AI revenues in H2 2025. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider what the core of your portfolio will ... More be made up of and your investment aims. You could spend your $1,000 on anything, but you made the wise decision to invest it in equities to grow your wealth. This guide will share some of the best stocks for 2025 including growth, income and volatile but high-returning opportunities. These recommendations are based on analyst ratings, sector exposure, earnings and recent momentum. As you consider this mix of equity options including the "magnificent seven” stocks, large value-oriented companies, REITs and technology stocks, you’ll see some familiar names as well as learn new ones, each with interesting theses as to why you should consider them for your portfolio. Ultimately, constructing a portfolio is research intensive and while you may not invest in each of these picks, you’ll hopefully be exposed to new industries and gain insight into the vast array of stock opportunities at your disposal. Microsoft is a tech giant and household name known for a variety of products from software with Office and Windows, to cloud computing services with Azure, to gaming with Xbox. Its latest venture in AI, through Copilot in partnership with OpenAI, is bringing AI functionality to a broader audience in hopes of better competing with Google and Apple, both of whom are expanding AI features to their customer bases. This behemoth tech stock is a pick because of both its strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, as well as its reliable dividend. Microsoft is also worthwhile to consider for your stock portfolio because of its aforementioned offering of Azure, the customer base of which is growing 14.2% year-over-year, with over 350,000 organizations utilizing it. This strong showing makes Microsoft more competitive with Amazon’s AWS, a dominant cloud services provider. Microsoft is an ideal fit for investors seeking a long-term hold stock delivering innovation-fueled growth, a strong leadership team, and security in a world adapting to AI. You’ve likely heard of NVIDIA in the context of its dominance in the world of chips, with the company holding over 80% market share for sale of data center GPUs. In particular, NVIDIA’s H100 and its now in full production Blackwell chips which power AI training and compute for the top technology firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s growth isn’t slowing down with revenue in Q1 up 69% from a year ago. While this firm does have a high P/E, NVIDIA backs it up with strong revenue and income rising as more firms invest in AI to capture its promise. The majority of analysts also maintain this stock as a buy or strong buy. NVIDIA is a good fit for those who want a high-growth stock with more room to grow, who don’t prioritize a dividend yield and who are bullish on the continued adoption of AI. Long associated with its founder, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway is a large firm delivering broad exposure to industries like insurance through Geico, car manufacturers like Mitsubishi, and technology like Apple. While Buffett may have recently stepped down, Berkshire is in solid leadership hands with years of experience working under Buffett’s tutelage and with his famous methodology and wisdom, passed down by both memos and direct work experience. Berkshire holds over $340 billion in cash, awaiting a market downturn or the right opportunities, giving them a secure buffer and investment capital for their next big stakes. While Berkshire offers no dividend, this stock offers high returns with over 20% returned over the last year. This stock offers diversification and a conservative value-driven investing approach to your portfolio. Visa is a credit card-processing giant which processes north of 40 billion transactions annually, earning fees from each purchase. With a moat built around its network which is global, billions of cards in use, deep integration with financial institutions and over 1 billion more cards in circulation than its primary competitor, Mastercard, Visa is well positioned to provide financial sector exposure and security to investors. Visa continues to expand, with new partnerships penetrating into emerging markets, and growth from digital payments through providers like Apple Pay. A majority of analysts consider Visa a buy or strong buy based on its financials and growth prospects. Investors who want a dominant financial sector stock which is conservative and global would be well suited to buy this stock. Palantir is a technology company which offers software systems primarily to the U.S. government but also to corporate clients with a suite of platforms delivering data integration, intelligence and analysis. Two of its primary platforms are Foundry, which is used for data centralization and analysis by healthcare companies, commercial firms and governments, as well as Gotham, which is an intelligence and data platform used for defense. With year-over-year revenue growth of 39% and a recent contract with the U.S. government of more than $100 million, Palantir is well positioned for growth from both its commercial and government platforms. Palantir is a mixed bag in analysts’ eyes with many considering it a stock to hold rather than buy. But with a moat of hard-to-acquire contracts from major firms and government actors and increasingly-advanced products fueled by AI, Palantir could be a worthwhile growth play in your portfolio. Ideal investors for this stock would be those comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term growth who are not seeking a dividend. Realty Income is a top REIT that owns thousands of commercial properties which lease space to firms like Walgreens, FedEx and other well-known consumer-facing companies. Investors choose O for reliable, monthly dividends which have been paying out income for decades even in the midst of economic downturns. Realty Income offers around 5.6% in dividends making it a desirable option for investors seeking reliable income, like retirees, those supplementing their own income or investors seeking to round out a growth-heavy portfolio. Realty Income’s diverse clients provide some resiliency even in down markets, and this stock has performed well even as growth stocks dip in price. O could be a good addition to your portfolio if you’re seeking to balance out other equities, if you’re seeking income or would simply like real estate exposure without buying land or properties yourself. Carvana is a technology-driven firm which makes it easy for consumers to buy or finance cars online. While its business suffered and nearly went bankrupt in 2022, it grew considerably over the last two years, nearly reaching its 2021 peak of just over $360 a share. This return to life was due to its innovative car purchasing model and drastically reduced costs. Carvana is a volatile, growth-driven stock that should be considered by investors seeking short-term gains as it rises in value. Over the last year it experienced a return of over 172% without sign of slowing down. As with Strategy, which will be discussed next, consider your risk tolerance and what percentage of your portfolio you would feel comfortable risking for juiced portfolio returns. Bitcoin treasury companies are a big trend in 2025 as they bet on bitcoin’s continued growth and adoption. The principal driver of this trend is Strategy Incorporated (previously Microstrategy). Strategy holds almost 600,000 Bitcoin, each valued as of July 1, 2025 at $105,820, and continues to buy the cryptocurrency by issuing debt or equity. This stock has risen over 170% in the last year fueled by easing of regulation on crypto, clearance of bitcoin ETFs and speculation that bitcoin will continue to rise in price. Microstrategy is thought of by some as a leveraged BTC play as MSTR often grows by 2x to 3x the growth of bitcoin, but this leverage can work in the opposite direction if bitcoin crashes. MSTR is a worthwhile investment for investors who don’t mind the high risk that the stock or BTC carries, in the hopes of continued high growth. If you do consider using part of your $1,000 to purchase MSTR, understand the risk that both this stock and bitcoin carries and invest according to your risk tolerance. Bottom Line When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider your risk tolerance, but also what the core of your portfolio will be made up of and your investment aims. From this list, a good core stock makeup for stability, quality and reasonable growth would be Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa and Berkshire Hathaway. Good growth stocks to add in moderation and according to risk tolerance, are Palantir and Carvana. For additional yield, Realty Income could be added to deliver monthly dividends and stability in downturns, and finally, Strategy could be added to deliver crypto exposure as well as the potential for high returns. This stock mix with your $1,000 would deliver income, growth and portfolio stability. Ultimately there are thousands of stocks available to consider for your portfolio but with research, analysis and consideration of your financial position, you can grow your net worth and achieve the future you seek.

Title: One Big Beautiful Bill & Job Growth Send Stocks To New Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Continued job growth and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the One Beautiful Big Bill ... More Act (OBBBA) helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms as the next big hurdle this week. Better-than-expected job growth and the passage of US tax legislation propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Friday. Please note that the tax bill is named the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA), so no partisan political views are intended by using its name. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The resiliency of the labor market and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the OBBBA helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since the stocks bottomed, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. This data bolsters confidence in the view that the macroeconomic situation has been the primary driver of stocks so far this year. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks The S&P 500 reached an all-time high in the holiday-shortened week, now resting at 2.2% above its previous mid-February high after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 3.5% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. The strength in US bank stocks remains notable. The Federal Reserve recently revised its methodology, which will result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital means better profitability and the ability to return more capital to shareholders. In addition, banks are economically sensitive, so they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. Market Returns Employment grew by 147,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly higher, which is a positive. The household survey data was solid, with a gain of 93,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 751,000. The significant increase in the research series reverses much of the decline from the previous month. Monthly Job Growth Contrary to expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. The decline was due to job gains of 93,000 in the household survey and a reduction of 130,000 in the labor force. US Unemployment Rate Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.8% last month. The average workweek hours were lower at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, hampered by weather and the LA fires. Workweek & Wages Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The improvement in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market has been resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Bottom line: The details of the jobs report were less impressive than the headline, but job growth was better than expected, and labor market health remains solid. Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. The better jobs data eliminated any chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is still expected in September. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Economic data releases are sparse this week. In addition, there are only two companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings. Now that the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA) has been signed into law, President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline should be the focus. While deals with Vietnam and the UK, as well as a détente with China, have been reached, the tariff levels of many large trading partners remain unsettled, barring a trade agreement. President Trump said letters are being sent to the countries notifying them of the effective tariff rate on their exports to the US, effective August 1, unless a trade deal is reached. Market participants will be keen to see if more trade deals are signed or if the possible economic drag from higher tariffs begins to weigh on the US economic outlook again. Stocks have reacted favorably to the better economic data and the likely boost from the tax cuts passed last week. The hurdles at these valuation levels are higher, but optimism about future corporate earnings has improved as economic downside risks have receded. Another spike in effective tariff rates around President Trump’s July 9 deadline could raise concerns about the economic headwinds increasing again, so increased volatility would not be unexpected.

Title: Are Deals Back? IPOs, M&A Recover After 'Liberation Day' Blip

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.
