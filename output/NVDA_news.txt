Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

Title: Why Some Analysts Say Qualcomm's Potential Takeover of Intel is 'Impractical'

Intel (INTC) shares have gained ground as investors reacted to a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that said Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a “takeover approach” to the beleaguered chipmaker. However, securities analysts are less keen on the idea, with those at Bank of America calling it “intriguing but perhaps impractical.” A Qualcomm takeover could offer Intel a lifeline for its struggling foundry business, which produces chips for outside customers, the firm noted in a research note released on Saturday. Intel could fill its manufacturing facilities with Qualcomm products, and Qualcomm could become a significant customer for Intel’s silicon wafers. That said, Intel is saddled with more than $50 billion in debt, and Qaulcomm has just $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, making a takeover deal difficult, the BofA analysts said. In addition, the move could “create confusion given potential for headcount and roadmap disruptions,” making such a merger a potential boon for rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). For a Qualcomm-Intel deal to go through, it likely would require a level of buy-in from the U.S. and Chinese governments, analysts at JPMorgan wrote over the weekend. Qualcomm could look for the U.S. government to provide a capital commitment to the foundry business, the success of which is important to domestic semiconductor production. Then there’s regulatory approval from China, which analysts acknowledge would be a major obstacle for such a move. The country "historically has taken years to even consider medium sized transactions," the BofA analysts said. Over the weekend, Apollo Global Management offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. Intel previously agreed to sell Apollo a 49% stake in a chipmaking site in Ireland in June. Shares of Intel gained 3.3% on Monday, while Qualcomm stock was down 1.8%.

Title: Intel needs Qualcomm, but it's not a two-way street, analysts say

After missing second-quarter earnings expectations and seeing its stock fall over 50% so far this year, Intel (INTC) is still attracting interest worth billions of dollars. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is reportedly interested in taking over the chip pioneer in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. And alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has also offered an equity-like investment that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world. However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits, and added they are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Arm. Here are three reasons Bank of America and other analysts say Qualcomm wouldn’t benefit much from an Intel takeover. A deal between a chip designer and a company with the factories to make those chips looks sensible from above, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note — but it doesn’t actually “fit so well.” While Qualcomm uses British chip firm Arm’s architecture for its PC chips, Intel’s x86 processors, which are used in a lot of computer and server hardware, are designed differently. Bank of America analysts also noted the difference, saying Qualcomm’s “existing established relationships” on the Arm architecture make “it tougher to bring product” to Intel’s mostly x86-based fabs. Meanwhile, Windsor said Intel’s x86 processors are “under assault on all fronts from Arm and accelerated computing,” and that Qualcomm has already spent two decades competing against Intel’s chips in the mobile and PC market. “Consequently, it makes no sense to become the owner of a fading titan when one is in a good position to partially or completely displace it from the market,” Windsor said. And Qualcomm already has a relationship with other chipmakers such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung, Windsor said, meaning it already knows “how to design its chips to be optimally manufactured on these processes.” Therefore, having to redesign its chips to be manufactured by Intel, which has already slipped behind with cutting edge chips, “sounds like a risky proposition to me,” he said. If Qualcomm does go through with an acquisition, it would come at a premium to Intel’s current expected value of $87 billion, Bank of America analysts said, adding that Intel also has about $53 billion in debt. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, analysts said. Intel is also planning to spend billions to support a growing fab network, including a five-year, $100 billion expansion plan for plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. While the chipmaker is expecting to receive almost $20 billion in direct federal funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to support the effort, it makes up a small portion of how much the expansion plan is expected to cost. Meanwhile, the chipmaker recently saw its shares close on a high after the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it is eligible for a separate $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding under the Secure Enclave program. Windsor also said in his note that “Qualcomm would almost certainly pay for Intel with shares” which would lead to “dilution for existing holders of Qualcomm’s stock” (which includes Windsor). And while Intel’s shares have fallen this year, Windsor said it’s still “not cheap” due to the chipmaker’s falling revenue. Bank of America analysts said the potential deal faces a “tough regulatory environment, specifically in China,” where medium sized deals have, in the past, “taken years to even consider.” Therefore, analysts said, the potential to dominate the CPU market would actually work against a takeover, because it could face regulatory challenges. For example, the analysts noted Qualcomm’s failed acquisition of Dutch semiconductor company NXP (NXPI) in 2018, after it did not receive approval from China’s antitrust regulator.

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-vs-amd-which-ai-stock-better-buy-now/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:36:08Z

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman is teaming up with former Apple (AAPL) design executive Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, to start a new artificial intelligence device company. Ive confirmed the project Tin in an interview with the New York Times published Saturday. According to the former Apple executive, it all started when Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky — a close friend of Altman’s and client of Ive’s design company, LoveFrom — arranged for the pair to meet for dinner last year. From there, Altman and Ive continued to meet, and decided that they would build a new device, with Ive responsible for the design. Ive and Emerson Collective, a firm founded by Powell Jobs, have already contributed, according to the Times. By the end of this year, the startup could reach $1 billion in funding. The secret project already has a physical office space and 10 employees. Key staffers include Tang Tan, who headed product design teams for the iPhone and Apple Watch, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Ive as Apple’s design chief. Ive left Apple in July 2019 after nearly three decades with the iPhone maker, and founded his own design studio, LoveFrom, shortly after. The Information first reported talks between Altman and Ive over an AI hardware project a year ago. Meanwhile, Altman’s OpenAI, the company behind popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, is in talks with several investors to raise billions of dollars in new funding, which would value the company at more than $100 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The funding round is reportedly drawing big names, including Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — which is in talks to potentially contribute $100 million. The latter owns a 49% share of OpenAI’s profits after contributing approximately $13 billion to startup, including $10 billion in backing in January 2023. Over the past two years, OpenAI has become the most influential generative AI company on the market. ChatGPT hit 100 million weekly users earlier this year, and kicked off the genAI and chatbot boom with the success of its flagship model. With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball. A deal allowing employees to sell stakes in the company valued OpenAI at $86 billion late last year, nearly triple what it was earlier in 2023.With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball.

Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks for two multi-billion dollar deals — including a takeover — as the struggling chipmaker continues to draw interest from investors. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to invest as much as $5 billion. That comes just days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm approached Intel with a takeover bid. Intel stock rose 4% to $22.69 per share in pre-market trading Monday. After missing revenue expectations for its second-quarter earnings in August, the once-dominant chipmaker’s stock fell 27%. The company reported revenue of $12.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024, falling short of Wall Street’s $12.9 billion estimates. The earnings miss was partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. So far this year, Intel has seen its stock slide 54%, as it falls behind new rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. To help give its business a boost, the Santa Clara, California-based company last month announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That includes reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel has also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC. But it’s looking to mount a turnaround, starting with several billions of dollars worth of investments from a pair of lucrative contracts announced last week. The Department of Defense and Department of Commerce announced Intel had been awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave, which is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. Also last week, Intel and Amazon Web Services (AMZN) announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar collaboration to advance U.S.-based chipmaking in Ohio. David Dietze, senior investment strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management (PGC), previously told Quartz that the AWS partnership and additional federal funding could mark the beginning of a turnaround for Intel.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers. While the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing. Nvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one. Here’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips. In July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million. “Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion. “Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said. And while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24. Google announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities. In August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers. Months after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times. In April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing. Meanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan. While Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS. However, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs. In March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever. In July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April. Meta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B. Meta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4. In September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps. The AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.” Microsoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks. In March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT. In May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said. Tesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging. “There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.” In September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app. Tesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap. Musk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.” When it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors. In September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks. In May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Full Content:
Micron Technology (MU) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner to swing to a profit. The Street expects the company to report net income of $975.41 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $1.43 billion a year earlier. Revenue is projected to nearly double to $7.66 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Micron has grappled with growing inventories, and Citi analysts recently lowered their price target for the stock to $150 from $175, citing its high inventory and weakness in demand for legacy memory components. However, the analysts said inventory buildup could ease by the end of the year, adding they "expect Micron’s revenue and gross margins to increase for the next several quarters." The analyst consensus for Micron’s fiscal first quarter of 2025 is revenue of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.45, according to Visible Alpha. Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Micron to $100 from $140 ahead of the company's earnings report, pointing to high inventories and signs of "persistently weak demand across all end markets except AI." Micron could see demand improve next year, the analysts said, fueled by "an AI-driven upgrade cycle for edge devices, continued strength in datacenters, and the potential for a traditional server refresh." Micron shares rose close to 2% to $90.90 Friday and have gained about 6.5% since the start of the year.
